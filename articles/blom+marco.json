The intervention-involving among others personal email contacts with a dementia nurse-was compared with online interventions without these email contacts.","A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 81 family caregivers of people with dementia who live at home. Participants were randomly assigned to a (1) major self-management support intervention consisting of personal email contacts with a specialist dementia nurse, online videos, and e-bulletins; (2) medium intervention consisting only of online videos and e-bulletins; or (3) minor intervention consisting of only the e-bulletins. The primary outcome was family caregivers' self-efficacy in dealing with behavior changes of the relative with dementia. Secondary outcomes were family caregivers' reports of behavior problems in the people with dementia and the quality of the relationship between the family caregiver and the person with dementia. Measurements were performed at the baseline and at 6 (T1) and 12 weeks (T2) after the baseline. A mixed-model analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes of the 3 intervention arms.","Family caregivers participating in the major intervention involving email contacts showed no statistically significant differences in self-efficacy after the intervention compared with the minor intervention involving only e-bulletins (difference -0.02, P=.99). In the adjusted analysis, the medium intervention (involving videos and e-bulletins) showed a negative trend over time (difference -4.21, P=.09) and at T1 (difference -4.71, P=.07) compared with the minor intervention involving only e-bulletins. No statistical differences were found between the intervention arms in terms of the reported behavior problems and the quality of the relationship between the family caregiver and the person with dementia.","The expectation that an online self-management support intervention involving email contacts would lead to positive effects and be more effective than online interventions without personal email contacts was not borne out. One explanation might be related to the fact that not all family caregivers who were assigned to that intervention actually made use of the opportunity for personal email contact. The online videos were also not always viewed. To obtain more definite conclusions, future research involving extra efforts to reach higher use rates is required.","Netherlands Trial Registry NTR6237; http:\/\/www.trialregister.nl\/trialreg\/admin\/rctview.asp?TC=6237 (Archived by WebCite at http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6v0S4fxTC).","RR2-10.2196\/resprot.8365."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9Judith G Huis in het Veld, Bernadette M Willemse, Iris FM van Asch, Rob BM Groot Zwaaftink, Paul-Jeroen Verkade, Jos WR Twisk, Renate Verkaik, Marco M Blom, Berno van Meijel, Anneke L Francke.

challenge for family caregivers in all phases of dementia, and assistance is needed for it. An online self-management support intervention was therefore developed and conducted involving the following elements: (1) email contact with a specialized dementia nurse, (2) online videos, and (3) e-bulletins containing information about behavior changes and how to manage them.","The aim of this study was to understand (1) family caregivers' actual use of various elements of the online self-management support, (2) family caregivers' evaluation and satisfaction with the various elements, and (3) nurses' usage and evaluations of the online support through the tailored email contacts.","A mixed methods design was used in this process evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods including analyses of dementia nurses' registration forms, the number of clicks on online videos and e-bulletins, evaluation questions answered by family caregivers in a survey questionnaire, semistructured interviews with family caregivers and nurses, and analysis of the content of the email contacts.","The actual use of various elements of the online self-management support by family caregivers varied: 78% (21\/27) of family caregivers had an email contact with the specialist nurse, 80% (43\/54) of family caregivers clicked on an online video, and 37% (30\/81) clicked on an e-bulletin. Family caregivers showed positive evaluations and satisfaction. The tailor-made approach in the personal email contacts in particular was valued by the family caregivers. Nurses' evaluations about providing self-management support online were mixed as it was a relatively new task for them.","An important insight is that not all participants made optimum use of the various elements of the intervention. Nurses also said that the email contacts were more often used to express feelings about coping with behavioral changes. More research is needed to investigate the reasons why people accept, adopt, and adhere to online interventions to reduce cases where they are not used and to back them up appropriately with tailored (online) information and advice for their personal situations."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9Judith G Huis in het Veld, Iris F M van Asch, Bernadette M Willemse, Paul-Jeroen Verkade, Anne Margriet Pot, Marco M Blom, Rob B M Groot Zwaaftink, Anneke L Francke.

Moroccan and Surinamese-Creole background. Because informal care is very important in these communities, it is pertinent to see what explanations female family carers have for dementia and whether they can discuss dementia openly within the community and the family. Method Forty-one individual interviews and six focus group interviews ( n\u2009=\u200928) were held with female Turkish, Moroccan and Surinamese Creole family carers who are looking after a close relative with dementia, and who live in The Netherlands. Qualitative analysis has been carried out, supported by the software MaxQda. Results The dominant explanations of dementia given by the female family carers interviewed are in line with what Downs et\u00a0al. describe as the explanatory models 'dementia as a normal ageing process' and 'dementia as a spiritual experience'. In addition, some female family carers gave explanations that were about an interplay between various factors. Turkish and Moroccan informal caregivers ascribe the causes of dementia relatively often to life events or personality traits, whereas Surinamese Creole caregivers frequently mention physical aspects, such as past dehydration. However, the explanatory model 'dementia as a neuropsychiatric condition', which is dominant in Western cultures, was rarely expressed by the informal caregivers. The female family carers generally talked openly about the dementia with their close family, whereas particularly in the Turkish and Moroccan communities open communication within the broader communities was often hampered, e.g. by feelings of shame. Conclusions Female family carers of Turkish, Moroccan or Surinamese Creole backgrounds often consider dementia as a natural consequence of ageing, as a spiritual experience, and\/or as an interplay between various factors. They feel they can talk openly about dementia within their close family, while outside the close family this is often more difficult."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Wezel","ForeName":"Nienke","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dutch Alzheimer Association, Amersfoort, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Francke","ForeName":"Anneke L","Initials":"AL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Public and Occupational Health, EMGO+\/VUmc, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kayan Acun","ForeName":"Emine","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Psychology, VU University medical center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Devill\u00e9","ForeName":"Walter Ljm","Initials":"WL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), Utrecht, Netherlands; Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Pharos Knowledge and advisory center, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Grondelle","ForeName":"Nies J","Initials":"NJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Pharos Knowledge and advisory center, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Blom","ForeName":"Marco M","Initials":"MM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Nederland, Amersfoort, the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"15"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["ethnology","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"Emigrants and Immigrants","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Morocco","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Suriname","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Turkey","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Women","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["communication","dementia","explanatory models","family care","immigrants","openness"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"1","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27306963","1471301216655236","10.1177\/1471301216655236"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25679228","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"01","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"10","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2015"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS One"},"ArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of an Internet intervention for family caregivers of people with dementia: results of a randomized controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e0116622"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0116622","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The World Health Organization stresses the importance of accessible and (cost)effective caregiver support, given the expected increase in the number of people with dementia and the detrimental impact on the mental health of family caregivers.","This study assessed the effectiveness of the Internet intervention 'Mastery over Dementia'. In a RCT, 251 caregivers, of whom six were lost at baseline, were randomly assigned to two groups. Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.","Almost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).","The Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable. The findings are even more promising because future generations of family caregivers will be more familiar with the Internet.","Dutch Trial Register NTR-2051

There is an urgent need to develop cost effective approaches that meet the needs of people with dementia and their family caregivers. Depression, feelings of burden and caregiver stress are common and serious health problems in these family caregivers. Different kinds of interventions are developed to prevent or reduce the negative psychological consequences of caregiving.

The intervention aims at prevention and decrease of psychological distress, in particular depressive symptoms. The experimental condition consists of an internet course with 8 sessions and a booster session over a maximum period of 6 months guided by a psychologist. Caregivers in the comparison condition receive a minimal intervention. In addition to a pre and post measurement, an intermediate measurement will be conducted. In addition, there will be two follow-up measurements 3 and 6 months after post-treatment in the experimental group only. To study the effectiveness of the intervention, depressive symptoms are used as the primary outcome, whereas symptoms of anxiety, role overload and caregiver perceived stress are used as secondary outcomes. To study which caregivers profit most of the internet intervention, several variables that may modify the impact of the intervention are taken into account. Regarding the cost-effectiveness, an economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective.","This study will provide evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an internet intervention for caregivers.
