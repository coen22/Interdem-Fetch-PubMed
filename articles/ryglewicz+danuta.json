In 205 patients with dementia [89 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 47 with vascular dementia (VaD), 69 with mixed dementia (MD)], 113 persons with mild cognitive impairment and in 107 controls serum adiponectin, leptin and resistin levels, pro-inflammatory [interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and chitotriosidase] and anti-inflammatory (25-OH vitamin D, HDL-cholesterol and paraoxonase 1) markers, as well as glucose metabolism parameters (glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR) were determined. In all-cause dementia adiponectin and resistin levels were significantly higher as compared to the controls; leptin levels did not show differences. Higher adiponectin levels concerned AD and MD, whereas higher resistin-VaD and MD. After stratification by abdominal obesity the differences in adiponectin levels remained significant in subjects without obesity. In all-cause dementia negative correlation of adiponectin with obesity, glucose metabolism parameters, IL-6 and hsCRP and positive correlation with HDL-cholesterol were found. Positive correlation of resistin with age, IL-6, hsCRP and chitotriosidase and negative correlation with HDL-cholesterol and paraoxonase 1 were stated. We conclude that dementia of neurodegenerative origin is characterized by elevated adiponectin levels, whereas dementia with vascular changes by increase of resistin. Association with inflammatory indicators may suggest the pro-inflammatory role of resistin in the development of dementia, especially in dementia of vascular mechanism. Identification of this novel biomarker may be important in preventing dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bednarska-Makaruk","ForeName":"Ma\u0142gorzata","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

methylation) together with environmental and genetic factors, are key to understanding the pathogenesis of many diseases including dementia. Disturbances in DNA methylation have already been implicated in dementia. Homocysteine metabolism, with folate and vitamin B12 as essential cofactors, is integral to methylation processes. We evaluated in a case-control study the association of global DNA methylation, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 status with dementia. Selected polymorphisms of genes previously associated with dementia development and the influence of various factors on DNA methylation were also investigated. 102 patients with dementia (53 with Alzheimer's disease, 17 with vascular dementia and 32 with mixed dementia) were recruited. The non-demented controls consisted of 45 age-matched subjects without dementia and 47 individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Global DNA methylation was determined by Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit MDQ1 (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK). Plasma homocysteine, serum folate and vitamin B12 were determined by chemiluminescence. Plasma and erythrocyte 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and plasma methylmalonic acid (markers of folate and vitamin B12 status) were measured by HPLC. APOE, PON1 p.Q192R, MTHFR 677C>T (c.665C>T) and IL1B-511C>T polymorphisms were identified using PCR-RFLP methods. Patients with dementia had significantly higher concentrations of homocysteine (p=0.012) and methylmalonic acid (p=0.016) and lower folate (p=0.002) and plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (p=0.005) than non-demented subjects. There was no difference in DNA methylation between patients and controls. A non-significant tendency to higher DNA methylation in patients with vascular dementia (p=0.061) was observed. Multivariate regression analysis of all recruited individuals demonstrated a significant positive association between DNA methylation and folate (p=0.013), creatinine (p=0.003) concentrations and IL1B-511T (p=0.002) and PON1 192R (p=0.049) alleles and negative association with fasting glucose (p=0.004). The biochemical results showed significantly lower folate and vitamin B12 status in demented patients than controls. Global DNA methylation was associated with markers of folate status, creatinine, glucose and PON1 and IL1B polymorphisms.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Particular attention has been focused on measuring volumes of brain structures. Only few studies have investigated whether the cerebellar volume changes with the stage of dementia. It is controversial whether the serum apolipoprotein E (ApoE) level is an appropriate AD marker. This study was designed to clarify the significance of both cerebellar volume measurements and ApoE level measurements as markers of neurodegenerative changes. This study included 55 subjects with AD, 30 subjects with mild cognitive impairments (MCI), and a control group with 30 subjects. We measured the brain, cerebellum, and brain stem volumes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We determined serum ApoE levels, APOE genotypes, and neuropsychological test scores. In the control group, we found that ApoE levels were significantly higher for subjects with the APOE 2\/3 genotype than those with the 4\/4 genotype. This finding may indicate that ApoE plays a protective role against AD development in subjects with the APOE 2\/3 genotype. ApoE levels were not significantly different in patients with AD and MCI. No correlations were found between serum ApoE levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores or the volumes of brain structures. This study could not confirm the appropriateness of the cerebellum volume as an early AD marker. Correlations were found between cerebellar volume, brain volume, and the MMSE scores."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"\u0141ojkowska","ForeName":"Wanda","Initials":"W","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"First Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Sobieskiego 9, 02-957 Warsaw, Poland. wlojkowska@poczta.onet.pl."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Witkowski","ForeName":"Grzegorz","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bednarska-Makaruk","ForeName":"Ma\u0142gorzata","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wehr","ForeName":"Hanna","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sienkiewicz-Jarosz","ForeName":"Halina","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Graban","ForeName":"A\u0142\u0142a","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bochy\u0144ska","ForeName":"Anna","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wi\u015bniewska","ForeName":"Anna","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guga\u0142a","ForeName":"Magdalena","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"S\u0142awi\u0144ska","ForeName":"Ksenia","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sawicka","ForeName":"Beata","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Poniatowska","ForeName":"Renata","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ryglewicz","ForeName":"Danuta","Initials":"D"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United Arab Emirates","MedlineTA":"Curr Alzheimer Res","NlmUniqueID":"101208441","ISSNLinking":"1567-2050"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Apolipoproteins E"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["blood","genetics","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Apolipoproteins E","QualifierName":["blood","genetics"]},{"DescriptorName":"Atrophy","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebellum","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["blood","genetics","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Dysfunction","QualifierName":["blood","genetics","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Genotype"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Organ Size"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"02"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2013","Month":"06","Day":"20"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2013","Month":"06","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"10","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"10","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"6","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24117117","CAR-EPUB-56707","10.2174\/15672050113106660161"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23821382","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"07","Day":"06"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"12"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1509-572X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"51","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2013"}},"Title":"Folia neuropathologica","ISOAbbreviation":"Folia Neuropathol"},"ArticleTitle":"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene-108C>T and p.Q192R polymorphisms and arylesterase activity of the enzyme in patients with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"111-9"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity was determined using phenylacetate as substrate (arylesterase activity) in 304 individuals with dementia--136 recognised as probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 64 as dementia of vascular origin (VaD) and 104 as mixed dementia (MD) and in 129 persons without symptoms of dementia and in a good general health. -108C>T polymorphism in the PON1 gene promoter and p.Q192R polymorphism in the coding region were identified. PON1 activity was significantly lower in demented patients as compared with controls particularly in dementia of a neurodegenerative character (AD and MD). The prevalence of PON1-108T allele carriers was significantly higher in the AD group than in controls. The frequencies of the p.Q192R genotypes did not differ significantly between the investigated groups. An association of the rare T-R haplotype with dementia, particularly with dementia of the neurodegenerative type, was found. Multivariate regression analysis showed a significant association of PON1 activity with PON1 -108C>T and p.Q192R polymorphisms. The influence not only of promoter -108C>T, but also of p.Q192R polymorphism on PON1 arylesterase activity was observed. One has to admit that this kind of polymorphism does not preclude interference with the enzyme activity.

In the whole group with dementia significant positive correlation between PON1 activity\/HDL cholesterol ratio (i.e. HDL corrected PON1 activity) and insulin level as well as HOMA IR index, was observed. The multivariate analysis showed that the PON1\/HDL-C ratio was also significantly positively associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome (with insulin resistance as a major underlying trait) both in dementia and in control group. High insulin level and HOMA-IR are considered to be the traits of insulin resistance. It has however to be taken into account that they both could also depend on insulin production and release which, as was recently stated in cell experiments, are enhanced by PON1.

Ischemic lesions in the brain have an influence on the natural history of dementia. Vascular dementia can be caused by small-vessels disease (S-VaD) or by large-artery atherosclerosis with vascular lesions in strategic areas of the brain (M-VaD). In both cases changes in white matter are observed.

The study shows that the SPECT examination may be useful in distinguishing between AD, VaD, and FTD; however, for proper diagnosis in the early stages of AD, additional factors must be taken into consideration."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lojkowska","ForeName":"Wanda","Initials":"W","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Sobieskiego 1\/9, 02-957 Warsaw, Poland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ryglewicz","ForeName":"Danuta","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jedrzejczak","ForeName":"Tomasz","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sienkiewicz-Jarosz","ForeName":"Halina","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Minc","ForeName":"Slawomira","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jakubowska","ForeName":"Teresa","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kozlowicz-Gudzinska","ForeName":"Izabela","Initials":"I"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Clinical Trial","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Neurol Sci","NlmUniqueID":"0375403","ISSNLinking":"0022-510X"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Age of Onset"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Vascular","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, X-Ray Computed"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"6","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"1","Day":"24","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"6","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12417387","S0022510X02002940","10.1016\/s0022-510x(02)00294-0"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12417383","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"01","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0022-510X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"203-204","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Nov","Day":"15"}},"Title":"Journal of the neurological sciences","ISOAbbreviation":"J Neurol Sci"},"ArticleTitle":"Plasma antioxidant activity and vascular dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"195-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Little is known about the role of antioxidant activity in the pathogenesis of stroke-associated neuronal damage and impairment following a stroke. Increased free radical formation together with reduced antioxidant defense may increase neuronal injury. A low concentration of antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol may influence the development of post-stroke dementia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of alpha-tocopherol and susceptibility of LDL to oxidation in a group of patients with dementia in comparison to controls. In a group of 68 patients with dementia, according to DSM-IV criteria, 42 with vascular dementia (VaD), 26 with Alzheimer type of dementia (AD) and 46 age-matched persons, with no signs of cognitive disorders (control group), we measured lipids, alpha-tocopherol and the kinetics of LDL oxidation. The levels of triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were significantly lower in patients with VaD in comparison to AD patients, but the atherogenic index was similar in both groups. alpha-Tocopherol was significantly lower in patients with VaD in comparison to patients with AD and controls: 9.9, 12.6 and 12.6 ng\/ml, respectively, p<0.0001. Susceptibility of LDL to oxidation, measured by duration of lag phase did not reveal statistically significant differences between the groups. In patients with VaD, low levels of plasma alpha-tocopherol were observed, which indicate a reduced antioxidant defense in these subjects."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ryglewicz","ForeName":"Danuta","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, National Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rodo","ForeName":"Maria","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kunicki","ForeName":"Piotr Krzysztof","Initials":"PK"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bednarska-Makaruk","ForeName":"Malgorzata","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Graban","ForeName":"Alla","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lojkowska","ForeName":"Wanda","Initials":"W"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wehr","ForeName":"Hanna","Initials":"H"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Neurol Sci","NlmUniqueID":"0375403","ISSNLinking":"0022-510X"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antioxidants"},{"RegistryNumber":"1406-18-4","NameOfSubstance":"Vitamin E"},{"RegistryNumber":"97C5T2UQ7J","NameOfSubstance":"Cholesterol"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["blood","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Antioxidants","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholesterol","QualifierName":"blood"},{"DescriptorName":"Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Vascular","QualifierName":["blood","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Vitamin E","QualifierName":"blood"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"6","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"1","Day":"24","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"6","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12417383","S0022510X02002903","10.1016\/s0022-510x(02)00290-3"]}}}]}
