No single definition of reminiscence exists in healthcare literature; however, definitions offered have similar components. The term life review is commonly used when discussing reminiscence; however, both terms are quite different in their goals, theory base and content. This concept analysis identified reminiscence as a process which occurs in stages, involving the recalling of early life events and interaction between individuals. The antecedents of reminiscence are age, life transitions, attention span, ability to recall, ability to vocalise and stressful situations. Reminiscence can lead to positive mental health, enhanced self esteem and improved communication skills. It also facilitates preparation for death, increases interaction between people, prepares for the future and evaluates a past life. Reminiscence therapy is used extensively in dementia care and evidence shows when used effectively it helps individuals retain a sense of self worth, identity and individuality.

Psychosocial interventions, such as reminiscence, have the potential to improve the quality of life of people with dementia. However, while reminiscence is used widely in dementia care, its impact on the quality of life of people with dementia remains largely undocumented and there is a need for a robust and fair assessment of its overall effectiveness. The DementiA education programme incorporating REminiscence for Staff study will evaluate the effectiveness of a structured reminiscence-based education programme for care staff on the quality of life of residents with dementia in long-stay units.","The study is a two-group, single-blind cluster randomised trial conducted in public and private long-stay residential settings in Ireland. Randomisation to control and intervention is at the level of the long-stay residential unit. Sample size calculations suggest that 18 residential units each containing 17 people with dementia are required for randomisation to control and intervention groups to achieve power of at least 80% with alpha levels of 0.05. Each resident in the intervention group is linked with a nurse and care assistant who have taken the structured reminiscence-based education programme. Participants in the control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome is quality of life of residents as measured by the Quality of Life-AD instrument. Secondary outcomes include agitation, depression and carer burden. Blinded outcome assessment is undertaken at baseline and at 18-22 weeks post-randomisation.","Trials on reminiscence-based interventions for people with dementia have been scarce and the quality of the information arising from those that have been done has been undermined by methodological problems, particularly in relation to scale and scope. This trial is powered to deliver more credible and durable results. The trial may also convey process utility to a long-stay system in Ireland that has not been geared for education and training, especially in relation to dementia. The results of this trial are applicable to long-stay residential units in Ireland and internationally.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN99651465."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Shea","ForeName":"Eamon","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Irish Centre for Social Gerontology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland. eamon.oshea@nuigalway.ie"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Devane","ForeName":"Declan","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murphy","ForeName":"Kathy","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cooney","ForeName":"Adeline","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Casey","ForeName":"Dympna","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jordan","ForeName":"Fionnuala","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hunter","ForeName":"Andrew","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murphy","ForeName":"Edel","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN99651465"}}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"02","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Trials","NlmUniqueID":"101263253","ISSNLinking":"1745-6215"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing","QualifierName":["methods","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Ireland"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Recall"},{"DescriptorName":"Narration"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"06"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2011","Month":"02","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"6","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21320303","1745-6215-12-41","10.1186\/1745-6215-12-41","PMC3045903"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2000 Feb;15(2):141-61","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10679846"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2001 Jun;13(2):183-97","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11495393"}},{"Citation":"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2001 Nov;56(11):M693-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11682577"}},{"Citation":"Psychosom Med. 2002 May-Jun;64(3):510-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12021425"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 2003 May;51(5):657-64","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12752841"}},{"Citation":"Am J Public Health. 2004 Mar;94(3):416-22","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14998805"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2004 Aug;47(3):297-302","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15238124"}},{"Citation":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2005 Apr 18;(2):CD001120","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15846613"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 2005 Nov;162(11):1996-2021","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16263837"}},{"Citation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2005 Nov;13(11):991-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16286443"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2006 Jul;55(2):237-47","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16866815"}},{"Citation":"J Clin Nurs. 2007 Nov;16(11):2167-77","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17419797"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2008 Jan;12(1):14-29","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18297476"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimers Dement. 2007 Oct;3(4):411-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19595962"}},{"Citation":"Trials. 2009 Jul 30;10:64","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19642992"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord. 2009 Jul-Sep;23(3):285-90","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19812472"}},{"Citation":"Age Ageing. 2010 Jan;39(1):128-31","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19933448"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 1991 Feb;31(1):9-14","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"2007480"}},{"Citation":"Nurs Older People. 2007 Feb 1;19(1):19","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"27732365"}},{"Citation":"Biol Psychiatry. 1988 Feb 1;23(3):271-84","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"3337862"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 1986 Oct;34(10):711-21","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"3531296"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 1980 Dec;20(6):649-55","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7203086"}}]}}}]}
