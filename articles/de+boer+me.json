addresses the needs of patients and families affected by this life-limiting disease. On behalf of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC), we recently performed a Delphi study to define domains for palliative care in dementia and to provide recommendations for optimal care. An international panel of experts in palliative care, dementia care or both, achieved consensus on almost all domains and recommendations, but the domain concerning the applicability of palliative care to dementia required revision.","To examine in detail, the opinions of the international panel of 64 experts around the applicability of palliative care, we explored feedback they provided in the Delphi process. To examine which experts found it less important or less applicable, ordinal regression analyses related characteristics of the panelists to ratings of overall importance of the applicability domain, and to agreement with the domain's four recommendations.","Some experts expressed concerns about bringing up end-of-life issues prematurely and about relabeling dementia care as palliative care. Multivariable analyses with the two outcomes of importance and agreement with applicability indicated that younger or less experienced experts and those whose expertise was predominantly in dementia care found palliative care in dementia less important and less applicable.","Benefits of palliative care in dementia are acknowledged by experts worldwide, but there is some controversy around its early introduction. Further studies should weigh concerns expressed around care receiving a \"palliative\" label versus the benefits of applying palliative care early."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der Steen","ForeName":"Jenny T","Initials":"JT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Center,Van der Boechorststraat 7,1081BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Radbruch","ForeName":"Lukas","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Palliative Medicine,University Hospital Bonn,Bonn,Germany; andPalliative Care Centre,Malteser Hospital Bonn\/Rhein-Sieg,Von-Hompesch-Str. 1,53123 Bonn,Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Boer","ForeName":"Marike E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Center,Van der Boechorststraat 7,1081BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"J\u00fcnger","ForeName":"Saskia","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of General Medicine,Hannover Medical School,Carl-Neuberg-Stra\u00dfe 1,30625 Hannover,Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hughes","ForeName":"Julian C","Initials":"JC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust,North Tyneside General Hospital,Rake Lane,North Shields,Tyne and Wear,NE29 8NH and Policy,Ethics and Life Science (PEALS) Research Centre,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Larkin","ForeName":"Phil","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"UCD School of Nursing,Midwifery and Health Systems and Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services,UCD College of Health Sciences,Belfield,Dublin 4,Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gove","ForeName":"Dianne","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Europe,14 rue Dicks,1417 Luxembourg,Luxembourg."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Francke","ForeName":"Anneke L","Initials":"AL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Center,Van der Boechorststraat 7,1081BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C M","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Radboud University Medical Center,Department of Primary and Community Care,P.O.

The elderly were found to be very capable of sharing experiences about their disease. They indicated not to experience their situation 'as a whole' as one of dreadful suffering. The gradual progression, which is distinctive of Alzheimer's disease, also allows people to adapt and adjust to their changing situation. As a result, the actual experiences of the disease can, in a positive manner, deviate from their anticipatory beliefs. The experiences of the participants appeared less negative than the ideas 'healthy' elderly often have about a life with dementia. The results from this study emphasize the importance of listening to the voices of people with dementia. Communication with elderly with Alzheimer's disease, is in the early stages quite possible and essential for advance care planning to be adjusted to their actual wishes and needs."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Boer","ForeName":"M E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Afdeling Verpleeghuisgeneeskunde, EMGO Instituut voor onderzoek naar gezondheid en zorg, VU Medisch Centrum, Amsterdam. m.deboer@vumc.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dr\u00f6es","ForeName":"R M","Initials":"RM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jonker","ForeName":"C","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"J A","Initials":"JA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"C M P M","Initials":"CM"}]},"Language":"dut","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article"]},"VernacularTitle":"De beleving van beginnende dementie en het gevreesde lijden."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"8210346","ISSNLinking":"0167-9228"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude to Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Euthanasia, Active, Voluntary"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21114055","10.1007\/BF03096211"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"20667617","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"03","Day":"07"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1872-6054","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"98","Issue":"2-3","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Policy"},"ArticleTitle":"Advance directives for euthanasia in dementia: do law-based opportunities lead to more euthanasia?","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"256-62"},"ELocationID":"10.1016\/j.healthpol.2010.06.024","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To obtain insight into current practices regarding compliance with advance directives for euthanasia (ADEs) in cases of incompetent patients with dementia in Dutch nursing homes, in light of the legal possibility offered by the new euthanasia law to perform euthanasia in these cases.","A written questionnaire was completed by 434 elderly care physicians (ECPs).","Over the years 2005-2006, many ECPs took care of patients with dementia and an ADE, actual life termination of these patients took place very rarely and never in incompetent patients. ECPs reported practical difficulties in determining the 'unbearableness' of the suffering and choosing the right moment of carrying out the ADE.","Although the enactment of the Dutch euthanasia law in theory provided a window of opportunity for euthanasia in incompetent patients with dementia and an ADE, it has not led to obvious changes in compliance with ADEs of this patient group in practice.

Insight into the experiences and wishes of people with dementia regarding advance directives is totally lacking in empirical research.","Ethics and actual practice are two \"different worlds\" when it comes to approaching advance directives in cases of dementia. It is clear, however, that the use of advance directives in practice remains problematic, above all in cases of advance euthanasia directives, but to a lesser extent also when non-treatment directives are involved. Although generally considered valid, their effectiveness seems marginal.

After an initial focus on euthanasia in advanced dementia, the actual debate concentrates on making euthanasia\/assisted suicide possible in the very early stages of dementia. A review of the few known cases of assisted suicide of people with so-called early dementia raises the question why requests for euthanasia\/assisted suicide from patients in the early stage of (late onset) Alzheimer's disease are virtually non-existent. In response to this question two explanations are offered.
