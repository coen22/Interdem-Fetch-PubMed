For that purpose, 1002 measurements of open nursing interventions in cases of agitation were obtained over a period of 11 weeks in two nursing homes in the city of Zurich and in the nursing home Sonnweid. Before, during and after two intervention periods of four weeks each, data were collected for 60 persons suffering from severe dementia. The results show that two-thirds of the residents were never agitated, one-quarter was moderately agitated and only very few suffered from medium-to-severe agitation. In almost half the cases, agitation occurred while the person was alone (46%), followed by cases of agitation as a constant state (26%). There was rarely any agitation while the residents were engaged in activities. After analysing 433 documented cases, it turned out that the most successful care interventions were avoiding noise, accompanying the person to the toilet, communication\/validation, walking about\/movement and administering beverages. Being based on newly translated observational methods and a unique longitudinal study design with combined intervention, this study provides important insights into how agitation in dementia can be influenced within the care context, as well as a practical evaluation of interventions specific to different institutions.

For this purpose, 12 test persons were persuaded to carry out observations with the OERS instrument in three care centres located in the Swiss Canton of Zurich. The test persons were predominantly holders of nursing qualifications and\/or experienced in caring for patients suffering from dementia. Data collection was undertaken on the basis of three focus group interviews which were evaluated via qualitative content analysis. The preliminary results gained in the focus group interviews were validated by the same people using a questionnaire. The categories were titled \"Missing Clearness\", \"Missing Possibility to Encode\", \"Level of Dementia\", \"Estimation of Emotions\", \"Influencing Factors\" and \"User Training\". These indicated that know-ledge of dementia is just as important as skilled use of OERS."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"H\u00e4ndler-Schuster","ForeName":"Daniela","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Zentrum f\u00fcr Ausbildung im Gesundheitswesen Kanton Z\u00fcrich, Schweiz. daniela.haendler@zag.zh.ch"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Geschwindner","ForeName":"Heike","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oppikofer","ForeName":"Sandra","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Them","ForeName":"Christa","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"ger","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article"]},"VernacularTitle":"Wie erleben Erfasserinnen den Umgang mit der Observed Emotional Rating Scale?"},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Switzerland","MedlineTA":"Pflege","NlmUniqueID":"8907069","ISSNLinking":"1012-5302"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Emotions"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":"instrumentation"},{"DescriptorName":"Switzerland"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"5","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"5","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20509114","10.1024\/1012-5302\/a000038"]}}}]}
