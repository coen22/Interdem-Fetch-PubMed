A process evaluation of the context, the recruitment and target populations reached (residents and nursing staff) and the delivery of the intervention and implementation strategy was carried out to explore the lack of effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA on the residents' prevalence of BPSD.","This study was part of a larger process evaluation using a mixed-methods design. Standardised questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, attendance lists, standardised protocols and written self-reports were used to collect the data. The quantitative data were analysed by calculating descriptive statistics. The qualitative interviews were analysed using deductive content analysis and the self-reports were analysed using a documentary analysis.","None of the NHs had prior experience with dementia-specific case conferences on a specific concept related to BPSD. The number of residents for whom a dementia-specific case conference was held was lower than expected. The number of nursing staff reached was high, although as defined in the study protocol, core nursing teams continuously participating in all components of the intervention were not established throughout the study. An analysis of the delivery of the intervention showed a reduction in the frequency of dementia-specific case conferences and deviations in the process structure and role structure of WELCOME-IdA. The strategy used to facilitate the implementation of WELCOME-IdA was mostly followed. An analysis of the recruitment of residents indicated that the variation in which residents were included in the study sample was high and that the intended sample size required to achieve a power\u2009>80% was not reached.","An analysis of the process evaluation data indicated that there were inaccuracies in the implementation of WELCOME-IdA and there were methodological limitations within the design of the effectiveness trial, both of which could explain the lack of effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA. To optimise the process structure of WELCOME-IdA, an assessment of BPSD and a pre-selection of possible domains for the behavioural analysis could be conducted prior to a dementia-specific case conference.","ISRCTN20203855 .

The first step in managing this type of behaviour is analysing its triggers. A structured assessment instrument can facilitate this process and may improve carers' management of the situation. This paper describes the development of an instrument designed for this purpose and an evaluation of its content validity and its feasibility and practicability in nursing homes.","The development process and evaluation of the content validity were based on Lynn's methodology (1998). A literature review (steps 1\u00a0+\u00a02) provided the theoretical framework for the instrument and for item formation. Ten experts (step 3) evaluated the first version of the instrument (the Innovative dementia-oriented Assessment (IdA\u00ae)) regarding its relevance, clarity, meaningfulness and completeness; content validity indices at the scale-level (S-CVI) and item-level (I-CVI) were calculated. Health care workers (step 4) evaluated the second version in a workshop. Finally, the instrument was introduced to 17\u00a0units in 11 nursing homes in a field study (step 5), and 60 care staff members assessed its practicability and feasibility.","The IdA\u00ae used the need-driven dementia-compromised behaviour (NDB) model as a theoretical framework. The literature review and expert-based panel supported the content validity of the IdA\u00ae. At the item level, 77% of the ratings had a CVI greater than or equal to 0.78. The majority of the question-ratings (84%, n\u00a0=\u00a0154) and answer-ratings (69%, n\u00a0=\u00a0122) showed valid results, with none below 0.50. The health care workers confirmed the understandability, completeness and plausibility of the IdA\u00ae. Steps 3 and 4 led to further item clarification. The carers in the study considered the instrument helpful for reflecting challenging behaviour and beneficial for the care of residents with dementia. Negative ratings referred to the time required and the lack of effect on residents\u00b4 behaviour.","There was strong evidence supporting the content validity of the IdA\u00ae.

A scoping review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"375-85"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/hsc.12225","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is an early-onset and progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with strong changes in judgement, behaviour, personality and emotions. These changes can cause significant problems in everyday life for people with bvFTD and their families, and have implications for health and society. Currently, there are no suitable evidence-based specific interventions for people with bvFTD. This scoping review aims to identify the self-expressed needs, demands and coping strategies of people with bvFTD. Identifying these issues is the first step towards the development of need-based psycho-social interventions for people with bvFTD. A comprehensive literature research was conducted of German and English scientific articles published between January 2000 and October 2014 using the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, SocINDEX, GeroLit, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, the German National Library and additional search strategies in terms of a scoping review. Articles were identified by combining search terms related to 'frontotemporal dementia' with terms related to 'self-expressions', 'needs\/demands' and 'coping'. After excluding duplicates, two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of 2317 records for eligibility. Because eligibility could not be assessed from the titles or abstracts of 28 articles, those articles were assessed using the full text. One poster abstract met our research question and a few articles were related, but no article met all of the inclusion criteria. This lack of scientifically based knowledge concerning the perspective of people with bvFTD is discussed with reference to the search strategy and the research questions, disease-related aspects such as changes in behaviour or language and emotions and the difficulties in researching this topic. Recommendations are formulated for future research considering the perspective of people with bvFTD and that will involve the development of appropriate data collection methods. Subsequently, specialised interventions must be developed.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dinand","ForeName":"Claudia","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nover","ForeName":"Sabine Ursula","Initials":"SU","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holle","ForeName":"Daniela","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zischka","ForeName":"Matthias","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Halek","ForeName":"Margareta","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"04","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Frontotemporal Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["coping","demands","frontotemporal dementia","needs","scoping review","self-expressions"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"4","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25827780","10.1111\/hsc.12225"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25496425","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Dec","Day":"11"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"Process evaluation of the implementation of dementia-specific case conferences in nursing homes (FallDem): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"485"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1745-6215-15-485","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Challenging behaviors exhibited by individuals with dementia might result from an unmet need that they cannot communicate directly due to cognitive restrictions.

Understanding peoples' behaviors is the basis for the initiation of targeted interventions to improve the quality of care for people with dementia. Furthermore, case conferences demonstrate positive effects on burnout, dementia-specific burden, and vocational action competence of the staff. The two likely approaches for conducting case conferences include the following: A) using a structured assessment instrument, which guides the staff in understanding the residents' behaviors and B) using a narrative approach in which the staff must identify the reasons for the residents' behaviors in an unstructured manner. Case conferences are a complex intervention, and evaluating their multiple effects is challenging. The aim of this study protocol was to describe a likely solution for evaluating this type of complex intervention using a special cluster randomized trial.","In this stepped-wedged cluster randomized trial, the two interventions will be sequentially implemented every three months in a group of 12 nursing homes (clusters) with a minimum of 360 residents over 19\u00a0months (7\u00a0months of intervention for each cluster and follow-up). The primary outcome is the reduction of challenging behavior (measured with the neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home version [NPI-NH]). Secondary outcomes are residents' quality of life, prescription of psychotropic medications, staff burnout, dementia-related stress, and vocational action competence. The effectiveness of the study will be accompanied by a process evaluation. The primary data will be analyzed using a Bayesian mixed effect model; the secondary data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed effects models.","The implementation and effect measurement of complex interventions such as case conferences within a cluster randomized trial are challenging (e.g., complex and intensive training, delayed treatment effect). In this study protocol, the methodological advantages and disadvantages of using the stepped wedge design to answer the research questions are discussed.","http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/ISRCTN20203855; registered 10 July

encountered when caring for people with dementia in nursing homes. In this context, a case conference is often recommended for healthcare professionals as an effective instrument to improve the quality of care. However, the subject case conference has not had great consideration in scientific literature. The aim of this review is to describe the effects of case conferences on people with dementia and challenging behavior and the staff in nursing homes.","A search of intervention studies in nursing homes in the German or English language was performed in the following databases: Medline, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Embase, and Google Scholar. The selection and the methodological quality of the studies were assessed independently by two authors. The results were summarized and compared based on categories such as study quality or outcomes.","Seven of 432 studies were included in the review. A total of four of seven studies showed a reduction in the challenging behavior of people with dementia, and five showed an influence on the competence, attitudes, and job satisfaction of the staff. However, due to the middle-range quality of several studies, the methodological heterogeneity and differences in the interventions, the results must be interpreted with caution.","In summary, little evidence exists for the positive effects of case conferences in the care of people with dementia. This review highlights the need for methodologically well-designed intervention studies to provide conclusive evidence of the effects of case conferences."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Reuther","ForeName":"Sven","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany. sven.reuther@dzne.de"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dichter","ForeName":"Martin Nikolaus","Initials":"MN"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Buscher","ForeName":"Ines","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vollmar","ForeName":"Horst Christian","Initials":"HC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holle","ForeName":"Daniela","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bartholomeyczik","ForeName":"Sabine","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Halek","ForeName":"Margareta","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"08","Day":"10"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Behavioral Symptoms","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interdisciplinary Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional Competence","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychological Techniques"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality Improvement"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Staff Development","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Workforce"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22883019","S1041610212001342","10.1017\/S1041610212001342"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21964934","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"01","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1012-5302","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Pflege","ISOAbbreviation":"Pflege"},"ArticleTitle":"[The influence of understanding diagnostics on perceived stress of nurses caring for nursing home residents with dementia].","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"303-16"},"ELocationID":"10.1024\/1012-5302\/a000143","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Health services for nursing home residents with dementia require the expertise of highly trained nursing staff. In addition, dealing with challenging behaviour of people with dementia is often stressful for nurses and causes major difficulties for them. Being a part of the general nursing guidelines, \u00abunderstanding diagnostics\u00bb enables nursing staff to deal with challenging behaviour of persons with dementia. The primary focus of the concept is to understand the behaviour. The aim of the study was to implement and evaluate \u00abunderstanding diagnostics\u00bb through structured case conferences and the application of the 'Innovative dementia-oriented Assessment system' (IdA) in nursing homes for the first time. Nursing staff of 15 nursing homes in North- Rhine Westphalia were trained about the content and implementation of \u00abunderstanding diagnostics\u00bb. Nurses' perceived level of stress was measured before (n = 106) and after (n = 71) the intervention (9 months). The study results show positive effects on the nurses' perceived level of stress. They support the use of structured case conferences and the IdA assessment in order to understand the behaviour of nursing residents with dementia. The implementation of \u00abunderstanding diagnostics\u00bb allows nursing staff to deal with challenging behaviour of nursing home residents with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holle","ForeName":"Daniela","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen, Standort Witten.
