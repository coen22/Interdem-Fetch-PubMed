The present study examines the efficacy of the Italian version of the therapy (CST-IT).","Older adults with mild to moderate dementia (n\u2009=\u200939) were randomly assigned to two programs: one group participated in the CST-IT, consisting of 14 sessions (twice a week for 7\u2009weeks) and the active control group took part in alternative general activities. The outcome measures were cognitive functioning (measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination-MMSE-, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment scale-cognitive subscale, the backward digit span test, and a narrative language test); quality of life (Quality of life--Alzheimer's Disease scale); mood (Cornell scale for depression in dementia and the social and emotional loneliness scale); functional activities in daily living (Disability Assessment for Dementia); and behavior (neuropsychiatric inventory).","After the intervention, only the CST-IT group maintained its MMSE score, while the control group displayed deterioration. The CST-IT group also performed better in some of the cognitive measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale and narrative language), mood measures (Cornell scale, social and emotional loneliness scale with a decrease in reported loneliness), and the Quality of life--Alzheimer's Disease scale. No other treatment effect was observed.","The findings confirm the efficacy, at least in the short term, of the CST in sustaining cognitive functions and perceived quality of life in older adults with dementia in the Italian care setting as well."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Capotosto","ForeName":"Emanuela","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Belacchi","ForeName":"Carmen","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Urbino, Urbino, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gardini","ForeName":"Simona","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Parma, Parma, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Faggian","ForeName":"Silvia","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro Servizi Anni Sereni di Scorz\u00e9 (VE), Scorz\u00e9 (VE), Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piras","ForeName":"Federica","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Laboratorio di Neuropsichiatria, IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia (Roma), Roma, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mantoan","ForeName":"Vanessa","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro Servizi Anni Sereni di Scorz\u00e9 (VE), Scorz\u00e9 (VE), Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Salvalaio","ForeName":"Elisa","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro Servizi Anni Sereni di Scorz\u00e9 (VE), Scorz\u00e9 (VE), Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pradelli","ForeName":"Samantha","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Azienda ULSS numero 3 Bassano del Grappa, Bassano del Grappa, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Borella","ForeName":"Erika","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"General Psychology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"07"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Affect"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Emotions"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Language"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["cognitive functioning","cognitive stimulation therapy","dementia","quality of life"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2015","Month":"09","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2016","Month":"05","Day":"07"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2016","Month":"05","Day":"13"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27272538","10.1002\/gps.4521"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17940336","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"02","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2007"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Visuospatial planning and problem solving in Alzheimer's disease patients: a study with the Tower of London Test.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"424-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Executive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently recognized as an early and prominent clinical sign.

Some preliminary information was collected on the diagnostic accuracy of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) compared with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in recognizing early AD from normal aging.","Fifteen AD outpatients (mean +\/- SD MMSE: 24.45 +\/- 2.61) and 30 age- and education-matched controls were submitted in a single blind protocol to a paper-and-pencil visually-presented version of the TSP, containing a random array of 30 points (TSP30).

Path lengths for subjects' solutions were computed and compared with the optimal solution given by a specific evolutionary algorithm called GenD.","TP30 discriminated significantly better between AD subjects and controls (ROC curve AUC = 0.976; 95% CI 0.94-1.01) compared with the MMSE corrected for age and education (ROC curve AUC = 0.877; 95% CI 0.74-1.005).
