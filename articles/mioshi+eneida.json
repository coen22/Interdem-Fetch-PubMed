The Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a well-established cognitive screening tool to diagnose dementia. But there have been few efforts to standardize the use of ACE-III across cohorts speaking different languages. The present study aimed to standardize and validate ACE-III across seven Indian languages and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test to detect dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the context of language heterogeneity.","The original ACE-III was adapted to Indian languages: Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Urdu, Tamil, and Indian English by a multidisciplinary expert group. The ACE-III was standardized for use across all seven languages. In total, 757 controls, 242 dementia, and 204 MCI patients were recruited across five cities in India for the validation study. Psychometric properties of adapted versions were examined and their sensitivity and specificity were established.","The sensitivity and specificity of ACE-III in identifying dementia ranged from 0.90 to 1, sensitivity for MCI ranged from 0.86 to 1, and specificity from 0.83 to 0.93. Education but not language was found to have an independent effect on ACE-III scores. Optimum cut-off scores were established separately for low education (\u226410\u00a0years of education) and high education (>10\u00a0years of education) groups.","The adapted versions of ACE-III have been standardized and validated for use across seven Indian languages, with high diagnostic accuracy in identifying dementia and MCI in a linguistically diverse context."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

quality of life (QoL) in people with dementia and to discuss priorities for future research. The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched in August 2017 with an updated search in January 2019. Fourteen systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of nonpharmacological interventions were identified. Dementia stage was rated moderate or severe in the majority of the reviews and type of dementia varied. Interventions reported to be effective were cognitive stimulation (QoL: standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.38), music-based therapeutic interventions (depression: SMD = -0.27, anxiety: SMD = -0.43, QoL: SMD = 0.32), and psychological treatments (mainly cognitive behavior therapy; depression: SMD = -0.22, anxiety: MD = -4.57). Although health-care professionals are recommended to continue using these approaches, future research needs to focus on the type and form of interventions that are most effective for different stages and types of dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kishita","ForeName":"Naoko","Initials":"N","Identifier":"0000-0001-8453-2714","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Backhouse","ForeName":"Tamara","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mioshi","ForeName":"Eneida","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol","NlmUniqueID":"8805645","ISSNLinking":"0891-9887"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer disease","anxiety","dementia","depression","quality of life","well-being"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"9","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31203712","10.1177\/0891988719856690"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"31178232","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1528-3984","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"40","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2019 Nov - Dec"}},"Title":"Geriatric nursing (New York, N.Y.)","ISOAbbreviation":"Geriatr Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Social support and high resilient coping in carers of people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"584-589"},"ELocationID":["S0197-4572(18)30639-6","10.1016\/j.gerinurse.2019.05.011"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"High resilience is associated with improved carer outcomes. Both individual factors and the availability of social support have been linked with resilience. This study was conducted to compare socio-demographic characteristics and the availability of social support for carers with low and high resilient coping, and identify if any domain of social support predicted high resilient coping in informal carers of people with dementia. The participants in this cross sectional survey included 108 informal carers of people with dementia. Findings showed the availability of emotional\/informational support was most likely to predict resilient coping and tangible support the least likely. However, when controlling for all covariates, only gender predicted high resilient coping, individual social support domains were no longer significant. Therefore, as no single domain of social support has a significantly greater influence on resilient coping, service providers should enable carers to build a wide, multi-function support network.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, ADL gradually decline in AD, impacting on advanced (a-ADL, complex interpersonal or social functioning), instrumental (IADL, maintaining life in community), and finally basic functions (BADL, activities related to physiological and self-maintenance needs). Information and communication technologies (ICT) have become an increasingly important aspect of daily functioning. Yet, the links of ADL, ICT, and neuropathology of AD dementia are poorly understood. Such knowledge is critical as it can provide biomarker evidence of functional decline in AD.","ADL were evaluated with the Technology-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (T-ADLQ) in 33 patients with AD and 30 controls. ADL were divided in BADL, IADL, and a-ADL. The three domain subscores were covaried against gray matter atrophy via voxel-based morphometry.","Our results showed that three domain subscores of ADL correlate with several brain structures, with a varying degree of overlap between them. BADL score correlated mostly with frontal atrophy, IADL with more widespread frontal, temporal and occipital atrophy and a-ADL with occipital and temporal atrophy. Finally, ICT subscale was associated with atrophy in the precuneus.","The association between ADL domains and neurodegeneration in AD follows a traceable neuropathological pathway which involves different neural networks. This the first evidence of ADL phenotypes in AD characterised by specific patterns of functional decline and well-defined neuropathological changes. The identification of such phenotypes can yield functional biomarkers for dementias such as AD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Slachevsky","ForeName":"Andrea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Geroscience Center for Brain Health and Metabolism (GERO), Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Avenida Salvador 486, Providencia, Santiago, Chile. andrea.slachevsky@uhile.cl."},{"Affiliation":"Neuropsychology and Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory (LANNEC), Physiopathology Department - ICBM, Neurocience and East Neuroscience Departments, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Avenida Salvador 486, Providencia, Santiago, Chile. andrea.slachevsky@uhile.cl."},{"Affiliation":"Memory and Neuropsychiatric Clinic (CMYN) Neurology Department, Hospital del Salvador and Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Av.

resilience in relation to stressful life events. Providing ongoing care for a friend or relative with dementia can be inherently stressful. The aims of this qualitative study were to: (a) explore discrepancies and congruency between definitions of resilience in the academic literature and carers own conceptualisations; (b) assess differences and similarities in conceptualisations of resilience between carers with high, medium and low resilience scores; (c) compare carers' perceived level of resilience with the level of resilience when measured on a standardised tool. Participants were recruited from an earlier study examining levels of resilience and well-being in UK carers of people with dementia. A subset of carers were identified using theoretical sampling, to ensure a diversity of participant characteristics and caring experience. Thirteen carers took part in semi-structured interviews between September and October 2017. Interpretative description was used to elicit findings relevant to clinical practice. We found carers' definitions were concordant with clinical and academic definitions described in the literature. However, they extended the concept and placed greater value on the role of self-compassion. Carers recognised that the appearance of resilience may have negative consequences in terms of securing support from others. Scores on the Brief Resilient Coping Scale did not always match carers' own perceptions of their level of resilience. Additionally, service providers' offers of support did not always reflect carers' priorities. Aligning these two areas would better enable carers and providers to work together to identify resources to support resilience.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Susan May","Initials":"SM","Identifier":"0000-0002-4812-6716","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Prestige Nursing and Care, Norwich, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mioshi","ForeName":"Eneida","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Killett","ForeName":"Anne","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"Agency":"National Institute for Health Research","Country":"International"},{"GrantID":"AS-SF-014","Acronym":"ALZS_","Agency":"Alzheimer's Society","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"07"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Resilience, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":"Dementia Carer Resilience"}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"25"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"09"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"3","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"5","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"3","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30844124","10.1111\/hsc.12732"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30017008","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"30","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Which interventions work for dementia family carers?: an updated systematic review of randomized controlled trials of carer interventions.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1679-1696"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610218000947","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["ABSTRACTObjective:The aim of this study was to update the literature on interventions for carers of people with dementia published between 2006 and 2016 and evaluate the efficacy of psychoeducational programs and psychotherapeutic interventions on key mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, burden, and quality of life).","A meta-analysis was carried out of randomized controlled trials of carer interventions using MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.","The majority of studies were conducted in Western and Southern Europe or the United States and recruited carers of people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia grouped as a whole.

a cohort of people with frontotemporal dementia and their carers (dyads).","The Tailored Activity Program is an occupational therapy based intervention that involves working collaboratively with

Twenty dyads randomized into the study (Tailored Activity Program: n\u2009=\u20099; Control: n\u2009=\u200911) were assessed at baseline and 4-months. Qualitative analyzes evaluated feasibility and acceptability of the program for the frontotemporal dementia cohort, and quantitative analyzes (linear mixed model analyzes, Spearman's rho correlations) measured the impact of the program on the dyads.","The Tailored Activity Program was an acceptable intervention for the frontotemporal dementia dyads. Qualitative analyses identified five themes: \"carer perceived benefits\", \"carer readiness to change\", \"strategies used by carer to engage person with dementia\", \"barriers to the Tailored Activity Program uptake\/implementation\", and \"person with dementia engagement\". Quantitative outcomes showed an overall reduction of behavioral symptoms (F\u2009=\u20098.073, p\u2009=\u20090.011) and maintenance of functional performance in the person with dementia (F\u2009=\u20090.375, p\u2009=\u20090.548).","This study demonstrates the potential for using an activity-based intervention such as the Tailored Activity Program in frontotemporal dementia. Service providers should recognize that while people with frontotemporal dementia present with challenging issues, tailored therapies may support their function and reduce their behavioral symptoms. Implications for rehabilitation The Tailored Activity Program is an occupational therapy based intervention that involves prescribing personalized activities for behavioral management in dementia. The Tailored Activity Program is an acceptable and feasible intervention approach to address some of the unique behavioral and functional impairments inherent in frontotemporal

identify distinct behavioral phenotypes of behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and to elucidate differences in functional, neuroimaging, and progression to residential care placement.","Eighty-eight patients with bvFTD were included in a cluster analysis applying levels of disinhibition and apathy (Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised) to identify phenotypic subgroups. Between-group (Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney ) functional differences (Disability Assessment for Dementia) and time to residential care placement (survival analyses) were examined. Cortical thickness differences (whole-brain MRI) were analyzed in patients with bvFTD vs healthy controls (n = 30) and between phenotypic subgroups.","Four phenotypic subgroups were identified: primary severe apathy (n = 26), severe apathy and disinhibition (n = 26), mild apathy and disinhibition (n = 27), and primary severe disinhibition (n = 9). Patients with severely apathetic phenotypes were more functionally impaired and had more extensive brain atrophy than those with mild apathy or severe disinhibition alone. Further imaging analyses indicated that the right middle temporal region is critical for the development of disinhibition, an association that remains with disease progression and in the context of severe apathy. Finally, no difference in time to residential care admission was found between phenotypes.","This study reveals that different clinical behavioral phenotypes of bvFTD have differing profiles of functional decline and distinct patterns of associated cortical changes. These findings emphasize the importance of apathy in functional impairment, highlight the role of the right temporal region in disinhibition, and suggest that disability may be a sensitive outcome measure for treatments targeting reduction of apathy. These phenotypes could also support understanding of prognosis and clinical management."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

Carers underwent a clinical interview based upon the neuropsychiatric inventory. Patients were assessed at ForeFront, the Frontotemporal Dementia Research Group at Neuroscience Research Australia or at the Brain and Mind Centre, between January 2008 and December 2013. An index of psychosis was calculated, taking into account the degree and severity of psychosis in each case. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were used to explore relationships between the psychosis index and grey matter changes.","Thirty-four percent of frontotemporal dementia patients showed psychotic features.  expansion cases were more likely to exhibit psychotic symptoms than non-carriers (64% vs. 26%; \u00a0=\u00a00.006), which were also more severe (psychotic index 23.1 vs. 8.1; \u00a0=\u00a00.002). Delusions comprised persecutory, somatic, jealous and grandiose types and were present in 57% of  carriers and 19% of non-carriers (\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Auditory, visual or tactile hallucinations were present in 36% of  carriers and 17% of non-carriers (\u00a0=\u00a00.13). Increased psychotic symptoms in  expansion carriers correlated with atrophy in a distributed cortical and subcortical network that included discrete regions of the frontal, temporal and occipital cortices, as well as the thalamus, striatum and cerebellum.","This study underlines the need to consider and assess for psychotic symptoms in the frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis continuum particularly in those with  gene expansions. The network of brain regions identified in this study is strikingly similar to that identified in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, which suggests that treatment strategies in psychiatry may be beneficial for the management of psychotic symptoms in frontotemporal dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Devenney","ForeName":"Emma

caregiver burden; (2) compare co-resident and live-out child caregiver burden; and (3) investigate factors influencing spousal and child caregiver burden. Data was collected from 90 caregivers of people with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) recruited from the Frontotemporal Dementia Research Group (Frontier) at Neuroscience Research, Australia. Of this caregiver group, 43 were spousal caregivers and 47 were child caregivers. Caregiver burden and emotional state were evaluated using the short Zarit Burden Interview and the short version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. The Social Network Index was applied to ascertain the social network of the caregiver, while the Intimate Bond Measure was used to evaluate the current quality of the relationship between the caregiver and the person with dementia. The Frontotemporal Dementia Rating Scale was used to assess severity of dementia. Spousal and child caregivers experienced similar levels of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress, regardless of disease severity. Co-resident child caregivers had smaller social networks and greater burden than live-out caregivers. Dementia severity was key in spousal caregiver burden, whereas caregiver depression was most important in child caregiver burden. Child and spousal caregivers of individuals with FTD share similar levels of burden, influenced by different factors. Future interventions need to account for these differences."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kaizik","ForeName":"Cassandra","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neuroscience

criteria for the diagnosis of frontotemporal dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) based on an international research workshop on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and ALS held in London, Canada in June 2015. Since the publication of the Strong criteria, there have been considerable advances in the understanding of the neuropsychological profile of patients with ALS. Not only is the breadth and depth of neuropsychological findings broader than previously recognised - - including deficits in social cognition and language - but mixed deficits may also occur. Evidence now shows that the neuropsychological deficits in ALS are extremely heterogeneous, affecting over 50% of persons with ALS. When present, these deficits significantly and adversely impact patient survival. It is the recognition of this clinical heterogeneity in association with neuroimaging, genetic and neuropathological advances that has led to the current re-conceptualisation that neuropsychological deficits in ALS fall along a spectrum. These revised consensus criteria expand upon those of 2009 and embrace the concept of the frontotemporal spectrum disorder of ALS (ALS-FTSD)."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Strong","ForeName":"Michael J","Initials":"MJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a

explored in primary progressive aphasia (PPA).","(1) investigate functional changes in two PPA variants [semantic (svPPA) and non-fluent (nfvPPA)], at baseline and after 12 months; (2) investigate baseline differences in behavioural changes between groups, and (3) explore predictors of functional decline after a 12-month period.","A longitudinal study involving 29 people with PPA (18 svPPA; 11 nfvPPA) seen annually in Sydney\/Australia was conducted. A total of 114 functional and behavioural assessments were included for within-group (repeated-measures ANOVA; annual rate of change; multiple regression analyses) and between-group analyses (pairwise comparisons).","Functional profiles in svPPA and nfvPPA were similar in people with up to 5 years of disease duration. Behavioural changes were marked in svPPA patients (stereotypical behaviour and apathy) but did not predict annual rate of change of functional abilities; global cognitive scores at baseline did. Despite mild behavioural changes in nfvPPA (disinhibition, apathy), these were significant predictors of annual rate of functional change.","The presentation and interplay of behavioural changes and functional disability differ in svPPA and nfvPPA. These varying factors should be taken into account when considering prognosis, disease management, and selection of outcome measures for interventions."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 S.

Syntactic comprehension was evaluated in ALS, FTD-ALS, PNFA, and controls using the Test for Reception of Grammar. Voxel-based morphometry examined neuroanatomical correlates of performance. Syntactic comprehension deficits were detected in 25% of ALS (p\u00a0= 0.011), 92.9% of FTD-ALS (p < 0.001), and 81.5% of PNFA (p < 0.001) patients. FTD-ALS was disproportionately impaired compared to PNFA. Impaired Test for Reception of Grammar performance was frequent in ALS with early bulbar involvement but did not correlate with bulbar impairment overall. Left peri-insular atrophy correlated with syntactic comprehension deficits. Syntactic comprehension deficits are frequent in FTD-ALS, more severe than in PNFA, and related to left peri-insular atrophy. A significant minority of ALS patients are impaired, but the relationship between bulbar symptoms and syntactic impairment is not understood.

This capacity is commonly affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as semantic dementia (SD) and behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Importantly, ABM plays a critical social function, facilitating relationship intimacy and empathy, and thus loss of ABM may also negatively affect families and carers.","To explore the relationship between ABM disruption and carer burden in AD, SD, and bvFTD, and establish whether characteristic ABM profiles differentially relate to carer burden across dementia syndromes.","We recruited 12 AD, 10 SD, and 13 bvFTD patients and their primary carer. All participants completed the Autobiographical Interview to assess memory for recent and remote events. Carers completed: the Zarit Burden Interview; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21); and the Intimate Bond Measure (IBM).","In AD, loss of recent ABM was associated with worse psychological wellbeing of carers on the DASS-21. In contrast in SD, remote ABM dysfunction was associated with SD patients showing greater controlling behavior within their intimate relationships. In bvFTD, surprisingly, despite pervasive ABM impairment, no relationship between extent of ABM loss and carer burden was observed.","These preliminary results reveal that ABM impairment impacts on patients' families and carers and suggest that these influences vary according to the pattern of ABM dysfunction. Disease-specific interventions focusing on preserved aspects of ABM may improve quality of life for both patients and

disease spectrum. Caregiver burden in subtypes of FTD has not yet been directly compared with those patients who have co-existent FTD and ALS (ALSFTD).","Perceived caregiver burden was evaluated using the short Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) in patients with behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD, n\u200a=\u200a21), semantic dementia (SD, n\u200a=\u200a18), and ALSFTD (n\u200a=\u200a15) at the initial clinical presentation and follow-up assessments. The Mini-Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (M-ACE) and the Motor Neuron Disease Behaviour Scale (MiND-B) were also used. Linear mixed effects models examined longitudinal changes on the ZBI, M-ACE, and MiND-B across groups.","Burden at baseline was highest for the bvFTD group. Longitudinally, perceived burden increased for the SD and ALSFTD groups whereas in bvFTD, the level of burden which was high at baseline and remained high with disease progression. The severity of abnormal behaviors at baseline, as assessed by the MiND-B, correlated with baseline levels of caregiver burden and further accounted for 23% of the variance in caregiver burden at clinical follow-up.","The trajectory of perceived burden differs across the FTD-ALS spectrum, with SD and ALSFTD caregivers demonstrating an increased burden that develops over time, compared to a persistently high level for bvFTD caregivers, evident throughout the disease course. The evolution of burden in these three syndromes likely reflects the initial presentation and clinical characterization that develops with time. Psycho-education programs for caregivers, which provide better coping strategies for challenging behaviors, may reduce levels of burden experienced with disease progression."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hsieh","ForeName":"Sharpley","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Brain

lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALSFTD) from those more subtle cognitive or behavioral symptoms (ALS plus) and motor symptoms only (ALS pure) is pertinent in a clinical setting. The utility of 2 validated and data-driven tests (Mini-Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination [M-ACE] and Motor Neuron Disease Behavioral Scale [MiND-B]) was investigated in 70 ALS patients (24 ALSFTD, 19 ALS plus, and 27 ALS pure). More than 90% of patients with ALSFTD scored at or below the cutoff on the M-ACE, whereas this was seen in only about 20% of ALS patients without dementia. The MiND-B differentiated between ALS pure and ALS plus diagnostic categories. Rasch modeling of M-ACE and MiND-B items revealed early cognitive (fluency, memory recall) and behavioral (apathy) symptoms in ALSFTD. The combined use of the M-ACE and MiND-B detects patients with ALSFTD, differentiates along the ALS continuum, and offers insight into the progression of nonmotor symptomatology in ALSFTD.

Meta-analyses were conducted, and when studies could not be combined, summaries were provided.","Forty-four studies examining 22 strategies were included in the review. Meta-analysis indicated beneficial effects of donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Rivastigmine, but not donepezil, was associated with greater risk of adverse events. Meta-analysis of memantine suggested that it is well tolerated but with few benefits. Descriptive summaries provide some evidence of benefits for galantamine, modafinil, levodopa, rotigotine, clozapine, duloxetine, clonazepam, ramelteon, gabapentin, zonisamide, and yokukansan.

While FTD has been associated with the presence of aberrant or unusual sexual behaviors in a proportion of patients, few studies have formally investigated changes in sexual function in this disease.","We aimed to systematically quantify changes in sexual behavior, including current symptoms and changes from prior diagnoses, in behavioral-variant (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD), compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD).","Carers of 49 dementia patients (21 bvFTD, 11 SD, 17 AD) were interviewed using the Sexual Behavior and Intimacy Questionnaire (SIQ), a survey designed to assess changes in sexual function across multiple domains including initiating, level of affection, and aberrant or unusual sexual behavior.","BvFTD patients show prominent hyposexual behavior including decreased affection, initiation, and response to advances by partners, and decreased frequency of sexual relations, compared to AD and to SD patients. The greatest changes in sexual behavior compared to pre-diagnoses were found in the bvFTD group with a 90-100% decrease in initiation, response, and frequency of sexual relations. Notably, aberrant or unusual sexual behavior was reported in a minority of bvFTD and SD patients and occurred in patients who also showed hyposexual behavior toward their partner.","Overall loss of affection, reduced initiation of sexual activity, and responsiveness is an overwhelming feature of bvFTD. In contrast, aberrant or unusual sexual behavior is observed in the minority of bvFTD patients.

semantic deficits in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD), compared to semantic dementia (SD) and controls. Semantic deficits were evaluated using a naming and semantic knowledge composite score, comprising verbal and non-verbal neuropsychological measures of single-word processing (confrontational naming, comprehension, and semantic association) from the Sydney Language Battery (SYDBAT) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination - Revised (ACE-R). Voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis was conducted using the region of interest approach. In total, 84 participants were recruited from a multidisciplinary research clinic in Sydney. Participants included 17 patients with ALS, 19 with ALS-FTD, 22 with SD and 26 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Significant semantic deficits were observed in ALS and ALS-FTD compared to controls. The severity of semantic deficits varied across the clinical phenotypes: ALS patients were less impaired than ALS-FTD patients, who in turn were not as impaired as SD patients. Anterior temporal lobe atrophy significantly correlated with semantic deficits. In conclusion, semantic impairment is a feature of ALS and ALS-FTD, and reflects the severity of temporal lobe pathology.

MRI images of 100 participants (33 ALS, 11 ALS-FTD, 22 bvFTD and 34 controls) were rated in four brain areas: orbitofrontal cortex, anterior temporal pole, anterior cingulate, and motor cortex. Areas were rated on a 5- point Likert scale by two raters blinded to the diagnosis. Results demonstrated that bvFTD patients showed the highest levels of atrophy across all regions, while ALS patients had the lowest atrophy scores. ALS-FTD patients have higher atrophy ratings compared to ALS patients for the motor cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal lobe, with a statistical trend for the orbitofrontal cortex. ALS-FTD patients were not significantly different from bvFTD for any of the brain regions. These findings were confirmed in a post hoc VBM analysis of the same participants. Our study demonstrates that a simple visual MRI rating scale can reliably distinguish ALS, ALS-FTD and bvFTD atrophy patterns in a clinical setting.

The C9ORF72 carriers were also more likely to experience psychotic symptoms (P =\u2009.03). The degree of brain atrophy was significantly less in the C9ORF72 cohort, and in many the progression was slow. Presenting features of C9ORF72 carriers were compared against International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria for bvFTD, and most cases failed to satisfy criteria for probable bvFTD.","The C9ORF72 mutation appears to be a common cause of bvFTD. Many of the C9ORF72 carriers have a family history of ALS or psychiatric illness. Psychotic features emerged as the most discriminating clinical feature between mutation carriers and noncarriers. Progression is often slow and brain atrophy is less pronounced than in nonmutation cases of bvFTD. These findings have clinical relevance for both diagnosis and selection of patients for genetic testing."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Devenney","ForeName":"Emma","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Prince of

The current study investigated insight deficit profiles across a large cohort of neurodegenerative patients (n = 81), including FTD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We employed a novel insight questionnaire, which tapped into changes across different domains: social interaction, emotion, diagnosis\/treatment, language, and motivation. FTD subtypes varied considerably for insight loss, with the behavioral variant worst and the progressive non-fluent variant least affected. All other subtypes and AD showed milder but consistent insight loss. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that overall insight loss correlated with ventromedial and frontopolar prefrontal atrophy, with exception of social interaction and emotion insight loss, which additionally correlated with lateral temporal and amygdala atrophy, respectively. Our results show that patients with neurodegenerative conditions show variable loss of insight, with ventromedial and frontopolar cortex regions appearing to be particularly important for insight.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hornberger","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neuroscience Research Australia, Barker St, Randwick, Sydney, Australia;

Nevertheless, to date, the underlying grey matter and white matter changes across the ALS-FTD disease continuum have not been explored. In this study fifty-three participants with ALS (n = 10), ALS-FTD (n = 10) and behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD; n = 15) as well as controls (n = 18), underwent detailed clinical assessment plus structural imaging using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis of magnetic resonance brain imaging to examine grey and white matter differences and commonalities across the continuum. Importantly, patient groups were matched for age, education, gender and disease duration. VBM and DTI results showed that changes in the ALS group were confined mainly to the motor cortex and anterior cingulate as well as their underlying white matter tracts. ALS-FTD and bvFTD showed widespread grey matter and white matter changes involving frontal and temporal lobes. Extensive prefrontal cortex changes emerged as a marker for bvFTD compared to other subtypes, while ALS-FTD could be distinguished from ALS by additional temporal lobe grey and white matter changes. Finally, ALS could be mainly distinguished from the other two groups by corticospinal tract degeneration. The present study shows for the first time that FTD and ALS overlap in anterior cingulate, motor cortex and related white matter tract changes across the whole continuum. Nevertheless, frontal and temporal atrophy as well as corticospinal tract degeneration emerged as marker for subtype classification, which will inform future diagnosis and target disease management across the continuum."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lillo","ForeName":"Patricia","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neuroscience

(FTD) than in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, little is known of the impact of the 3 main clinical variants of FTD- behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SemDem), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)-or the role of disease severity in caregiver burden. The Zarit Burden Inventory was used to measure caregiver burden of bvFTD (n=17), SemDem (n=20), PNFA (n=20), and AD (n=19) patients. Symptom duration, caregiver age, and relationship type were matched across groups. Moreover, a number of caregiver (mood, social network) and patient variables (functional disability, behavioral changes, relationship with caregiver, and dementia stage) were addressed to investigate their impact on caregiver burden. Caregivers of bvFTD patients reported the highest burden, whereas SemDem and PNFA caregivers reported burden similar to AD. A regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden in FTD, regardless of subtype, was explained by a model combining disease staging, relationship changes, and caregiver depression.

The resulting neuropsychological and behavioural data were analysed by Rasch analysis. ALS patients showed a similar profile to bvFTD patients on tests of working memory, inhibitory control and behavioural measures. Nine ALS patients (45%) had cognitive impairment and five (25%) met criteria for bvFTD. Even in a subset of MND patients with no impairment on the ACE-R, subtle impairment of inhibitory control together with moderate to severe apathy, were found. The Rasch analysis confirmed that all patients could be ranked on the same continuum, based on their neuropsychological performance and behaviour.

The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and are characterised by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10-20% of cases. Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioural features underpins the diagnostic process, with support from neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. A recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring patients and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration.

Discriminant analysis (SD versus AD) led to the formulation of a 'semantic index' (naming plus reading minus scores for serial-7s, orientation in time and drawing). Application of the semantic index to the patient data found values of less than zero to be predictive of SD rather than AD with 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity.
