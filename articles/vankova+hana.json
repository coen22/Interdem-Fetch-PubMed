Various factors including altered steroid biosynthesis may participate in its pathophysiology. We investigated how the circulating steroids (measured by GC-MS and RIA) may be altered in the presence of AD. Sixteen women with AD and 22 age- and BMI-corresponding controls aged over 65 years were enrolled in the study. The steroid levels (47 steroids and steroid polar conjugates) and their ratios in AD female patients indicated increased CYP11A1 activity, weakened activity of the CYP17A1C17,20 lyase metabolic step and attenuated sulfotransferase SULT2A1 activity at higher activity of the CYP17A1 17-hydroxylase step. The patients showed diminished HSD3B2 activity for C21 steroids, abated conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to cortisol, and significantly elevated cortisol. The women with AD had also attenuated steroid 7\u03b1-hydroxylation forming immunoprotective \u0394(5)-C19 steroids, attenuated aromatase activity forming estradiol that induces autoimmunity and a shift from the 3\u03b2-hydroxy-5\u03b1\/\u03b2-reduced C19 steroids to their neuroinhibitory and antiinflammatory GABAergic 3\u03b1-hydroxy- counterparts and showed higher levels of the 3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1\/\u03b2-reduced C21 steroids and pregnenolone sulfate (improves cognitive abilities but may be both protective and excitotoxic). Our preliminary data indicated functioning of alternative \"backdoor\" pathway in women with AD showing higher levels of both 5\u03b1\/\u03b2-reduced C21 steroids but reduced levels of both 5\u03b1\/\u03b2-reduced C21 steroids, which implied that the alternative \"backdoor\" pathway might include both 5\u03b1- and 5\u03b2-reduced steroids. Our study suggested relationships between AD status in women based on the age of subjects and levels of 10 steroids measured by GC-MS. ","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We calculated median proportions to compare distributions of categories of pain and discomfort tools.","We found that, despite variable content across tools, items from pain and discomfort tools overlapped considerably. For example, positive elements such as smiling and spiritual items were more often included in discomfort tools but were not unique to these. Pain tools comprised more \"mostly descriptive\" (median 0.63 vs. 0.44) and fewer \"highly subjective\" items (0.06 vs. 0.18); some used time inconsistently, mixing present and past observations.","This analysis may inform a more rigorous theoretical underpinning and (re)development of pain and discomfort tools and calls for empirical testing of a broad item pool for sensitivity and specificity in detecting and discriminating pain from other sources of discomfort."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.
