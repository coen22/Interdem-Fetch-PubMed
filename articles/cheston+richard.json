This study tests whether participants with dementia showed lessened or enhanced recall and recognition of dementia-related words compared with a control population.","Fifty participants living with dementia with mild levels of cognitive impairment and a control group of 52 participants without a diagnosis of dementia took part. A list of 12 words, composed of six dementia-related and six neutral words matched for frequency and length, was read out on four occasions, with the word order being varied for each presentation. Recognition was also assessed.","There was an interaction between word-type and participant group at both recall and recognition. While control participants recalled more neutral than dementia-related words, there was no difference for dementia participants. However, dementia participants recognised a significantly higher proportion of the dementia-related words, while there was no difference in word-type recognition for control participants.","This study adapts a social psychological paradigm to explore whether an important psychological mechanism for reducing distress can be affected by cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest that for people living with dementia, thought suppression may be either ineffective in reducing conscious awareness of distal threats or operate in an ironic fashion. While threatening proximal material may be repressed from awareness, distal threats may return into implicit awareness. This casts new light on research and has clinical implications."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons,

resources, such as self-esteem and social connectedness.","Our objectives were to find out if the benefits of nostalgia in non-clinical populations generalize to people with dementia and if nostalgia facilitates recall of dementia-related information.","All three experiments recruited participants with mild or moderate levels of dementia. Experiment 1 tested whether nostalgia (compared to control) enhances psychological resources among 27 participants. Experiment 2 used music to induce nostalgia (compared to control) in 29 participants. Experiment 3 compared recall for self-referent dementia statements among 50 participants randomized to either a nostalgia or control condition. Findings across experiments were synthesized with integrative data analysis.","Nostalgia (compared to control) significantly increased self-reported social connectedness, meaning in life, self-continuity, optimism, self-esteem, and positive (but not negative) affect (Experiments 1-3). Compared to controls, nostalgic participants also recalled significantly more self-referent dementia-related information (Experiment 3).","This series of experiments extends social psychological research with non-clinical populations into dementia care, providing evidence that nostalgia significantly enhances psychological resources. The finding that nostalgia increased recall of self-referent statements about dementia suggests that this emotion lends participants the fortitude to face the threat posed by their illness. The finding has potentially important clinical implications both for the development of reminiscence therapy and for facilitating adjustment to a diagnosis of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ismail","ForeName":"Sanda","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the West of England, Bristol, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Christopher","ForeName":"Gary","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the West of England, Bristol, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dodd","ForeName":"Emily","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the West of England, Bristol, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wildschut","ForeName":"Tim","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Southampton, Southampton, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sedikides","ForeName":"Constantine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Southampton, Southampton, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ingram","ForeName":"Tom A","Initials":"TA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health (NHS) Mental Health Partnership (NHS) Trust, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Roy W","Initials":"RW","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"RICE (The Research Institute for the Care of Older People), Bath, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Noonan","ForeName":"Krist A","Initials":"KA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health (NHS) Mental Health Partnership (NHS) Trust, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tingley","ForeName":"Danielle","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"RICE (The Research Institute for the Care of Older People), Bath, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cheston","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the West of England, Bristol, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":["ISRCTN54996662","ISRCTN78958013"]}}},"GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"202","Acronym":"ALZS_","Agency":"Alzheimer's Society","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Analysis of Variance"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Health Planning"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory, Episodic"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Recall","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","autobiographical memory","dementia","immediate recall","psychological adaptation"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"8","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"8","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30149444","JAD180075","10.3233\/JAD-180075"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30068624","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2044-6055","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"8","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"08","Day":"01"}},"Title":"BMJ open","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ Open"},"ArticleTitle":"How do people with dementia use the ambulance service?

The presence of comorbidities and dementia can make managing these patients more challenging and hospital admission more likely, resulting in poorer outcomes for patients. However, we do not know how many of these patients are conveyed to hospital by ambulance. This study aims to determine: how often ambulances are called to older people; how often comorbidities including dementia are recorded; the reason for the call; provisional diagnosis; the amount of time ambulance clinicians spend on scene; the frequency with which these patients are transported to hospital.","We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of ambulance patient care records (PCRs) from calls to patients aged 65 years and over. Data were collected from two ambulance services in England during 24 or 48\u2009hours periods in January 2017 and July 2017. The records were examined by two researchers using a standard template and the data were extracted from 3037 PCRs using a coding structure.","Results were reported as percentages and means with 95% CIs. Dementia was recorded in 421 (13.9%) of PCRs. Patients with dementia were significantly less likely to be conveyed to hospital following an emergency call than those without dementia. The call cycle times were similar for patients regardless of whether or not they had dementia. Calls to people with dementia were more likely to be due to injury following a fall. In the overall sample, one or more comorbidities were reported on the PCR in over 80% of cases.","Rates of hospital conveyance for older people may be related to comorbidities, frailty and complex needs, rather than dementia.

self-threatening information, the mnemic neglect effect (MNE). This selective forgetting is observed among healthy adults in the recall, but not the recognition, of self-threatening feedback.","Sixty-four statements about dementia were rated for their level of negativity by 280 staff and students at University of the West of England. The 12 statements rated as most negative and the 12 statements rated as least negative were then read to 62 people with dementia. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions with the statements referring either to self or to another person. High-negativity and self-referent statements had strong threat potential. Participants recalled the statements and then completed a recognition task, which consisted of the 24 previously read statements and 24 new statements.","Participants manifested the MNE: They recalled fewer high-negativity (compared with low-negativity) statements, but only when these referred to the self rather than another person. This pattern occurred independently of levels of depression or anxiety. Participants also made more self-protective intrusion errors when the statements referred to the self than another person. Participants did not differ in their recognition of statements.","The MNE occurs among people with dementia. The selective forgetting of highly negative, self-referent statements serves to protect the self against the threat that dementia represents. Given the similarities between the MNE and the clinical phenomenon of repression, the findings may mark psychological processes that are implicated in the acceptance (or lack thereof) of a dementia diagnosis."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

person with dementia and their family carer and outcomes for the person with dementia.","Systematic review.","Cohort studies of people with clinically diagnosed dementia and their main carers. Exposures of interest were any elements of relationship quality, for example, attachment style, expressed emotion and coping style. Our primary outcome was institutionalisation, and secondary outcomes were hospitalisation, death, quality of life and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia ('challenging behaviour').","MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library and Opengrey were searched from inception to May 2017.","The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias. A narrative synthesis of results was performed due to differences between studies.","Twenty studies were included. None of the studies controlled for all prespecified confounding factors (age, gender, socioeconomic status and severity of dementia). Reporting of results was inadequate with many studies simply reporting whether associations were 'statistically significant' without providing effect size estimates or CIs. There was a suggestion of an association between relationship factors and global challenging behaviour. All studies evaluating global challenging behaviour provided statistical evidence of an association (most P values below 0.02). There was no consistent evidence for an association for any other outcome assessed.","There is currently no strong or consistent evidence on the effects of relationship factors on institutionalisation, hospitalisation, death or quality of life for people with dementia. There was a suggestion of an association between relationship factors and challenging behaviour, although the evidence for this was weak. To improve our ability to support those with dementia and their families, further robust studies are needed.","CRD42015020518."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Technology based prompting may be used to support people with dementia to complete multi-step tasks in the home, provided that suitable tasks can be chosen and that a carer is able to load appropriate task steps onto the prompter. A prompter was developed specifically for this purpose, along with a detailed guidance manual. Twelve participants with mild or moderate dementia carried out cognitive tests and their carers completed carer burden and carer competence scales. Each pair attended a training session with a researcher and were provided with the prompter and instruction manual. The prompter was trialled at home for four weeks after a one-week familiarisation period, for use with a simple set task and one or two tasks chosen by the participants. Semi-structured interviews were used to capture the views of the participants at the start and end of the home testing, and to set and evaluate goals. Chosen tasks included preparing simple food and drinks, and using home appliances including coffee machines and television remote controls. There was a weak correlation between greater goal success for the participants and the carer goal success, number letter switching within the D-KEFS and ACE-III score. A thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three core themes relating to familiarity with technology, utility of the prompter and the cost versus benefit in terms of the effort required to set up the prompter. Factors influencing success could be grouped into: participants' motivation and capability; the design of the prompter; and the details of the task being carried out. Barriers to success included the difficulty of choosing a suitable task and the effort required to break down a task in to appropriate steps. All of the participants with dementia could follow the steps on the prompter, and all of the carers were able to choose, breakdown and load at least one task onto the prompter during the training session, but successful use in the home was varied because of the increased complexity of the home context. Changes to the hardware, software and manual were made in response to the data gathered during the study, in readiness for the planned further testing."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Boyd","ForeName":"Hazel","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Designability, Bath, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Evans","ForeName":"Nina","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Designability, Bath, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cheston","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the West of England, Bristol, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Noonan","ForeName":"Krist","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Institute for the Care of Older People, Bath, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harris","ForeName":"Nigel","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Designability, Bath, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Stud Health Technol Inform","NlmUniqueID":"9214582","ISSNLinking":"0926-9630"},"CitationSubset":"T","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Reminder Systems"},{"DescriptorName":"Self-Help Devices"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","activities of daily living","prompting","technology"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"9","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"9","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"4","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"28873772"}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25767142","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Personal message cards: An evaluation of an alternative method of delivering simulated presence therapy.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1703-1715"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Simulated presence therapy is a technique which utilises a familiar recorded voice to calm and reassure people with dementia who are agitated or anxious. Although simulated presence therapy has shown potential benefits in small-scale studies, practical limitations in making and playing the recordings have restricted its use. An alternative method of delivering a message from an attachment figure is through a personal message card. This was one of seven products used within the Bath Memory Technology Library which was made available free of charge to people affected by dementia and their carers. This paper provides an evaluation of the personal message cards. Although feedback was received on only 10 of the 24 cards that were distributed, for nine people there was evidence that the cards met the goals that had been set either fully or in part, and that people affected by even quite severe levels of dementia could benefit from them.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Evans","ForeName":"Nina","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Designability, Bath Institute of Medical Engineering, Wolfson Centre (D1), Royal United Hospital, Combe Park, Bath, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cheston","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Mental Health (Dementia) Research, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK Richard.Cheston@uwe.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harris","ForeName":"Nigel","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Designability, Bath Institute of Medical Engineering, Wolfson Centre (D1), Royal United Hospital, Combe Park, Bath, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"03","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety","QualifierName":["complications","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","anxiety","challenging behaviour","dementia","psychosocial interventions","simulated presence therapy","technology"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"3","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25767142","1471301215574363","10.1177\/1471301215574363"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25697501","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Making sense of dementia: Exploring the use of the Markers of Assimilation of Problematic Experiences in Dementia scale to understand how couples process a diagnosis of dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1515-1533"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This qualitative study aimed to see whether the Markers of Assimilation of Problematic Experiences in Dementia (MAPED) scale could be applied to couples. It aimed to explore the interactions between couples and how this affected the levels of assimilation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four heterosexual couples. The results suggested that MAPED can be usefully applied to couples. It highlighted the oscillating process which couples undergo as they process a dementia diagnosis. This supports the notion that making sense of a dementia diagnosis is not static, but a fluctuating and ever changing process. The strategies couples employed either facilitated or prevented the expression and integration of the Problematic Voice. The study highlights the importance of supporting couples together during a dementia diagnosis.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Snow","ForeName":"Katie","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK Katie.snow@nhs.net."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cheston","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health and Social Sciences, University of the West of England, Bristol, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smart","ForeName":"Cordet","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"18"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Characteristics"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","assimilation","coping","couples","dementia"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"2","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25697501","1471301214564447","10.1177\/1471301214564447"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25613981","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Primary care-led dementia diagnosis services in South Gloucestershire: Themes from people and families living with dementia and health care professionals.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1586-1604"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Primary care-led dementia services are an increasingly common form of service delivery; however, little is known about how these services are understood by their main stakeholders: the patients, family members and health care professionals.

Experiences in Dementia scale (MAPED) can be used to identify whether the way in which participants talk about dementia changed during the group. All eight sessions of a LivDem group, which were attended by participants were recorded and transcribed. An initial analysis identified 160 extracts, which were then rated using the MAPED system. Inter-rater reliability was 61% and following a resolution meeting, 35 extracts were discarded, leaving 125 extracts with an agreed marker code. All of the participants were identified as producing a speech marker relating to dementia, and these varied between 0 (warding off) to 6 (problem solution). Examples of these markers are provided. The proportion of emergence markers (indicating the initial stages of assimilation) compared to later markers changed significantly between the first four sessions and the final sessions. This difference was still significant even when the markers produced by the most verbal participant, Graham, were excluded. The use of process measures within psychotherapy complements more conventional outcome measures and has both theoretical and clinical implications."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cheston","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Health and Social Sciences, University of the West of England, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gatting","ForeName":"Lauren","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Health and Social Sciences, University of the West of England, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Marshall","ForeName":"Ann","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spreadbury","ForeName":"John H","Initials":"JH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine, NIHR CLAHRC Wessex, University of Southampton, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coleman","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Social & Human Sciences, University of Southampton, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"PB-PG-0610-22005","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"09","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy, Group"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","Dementia","assimilation","awareness","group psychotherapy"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"9","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"3","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"9","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26330383","1471301215602473","10.1177\/1471301215602473"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25888619","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"A feasibility study of translating \"Living Well with Dementia\" groups into a Primary Care Improving Access to Psychological Therapy service (innovative practice).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"273-8"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301215582104","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This paper describes the use of the \"Living Well with Dementia\" or LivDem model of group support for people affected by dementia within a Primary Care setting. Five people affected by dementia and their carers joined a 10-week group, although one man withdrew before the start due to illness. Joint sessions were held on the first and the final meetings, with separate parallel group sessions for people affected by dementia and their carers for the remaining eight sessions. One person affected by dementia and their carer withdrew due to illness before the end of the sessions : A self-report measure of Quality of Life suggested improvements for two of the three people affected by dementia who completed all of the sessions. The proxy ratings of carers indicated improvements for all three participants. Qualitative interviews were carried out with participants and carers to assess their experience of the group. Although both people affected by dementia and their carers found the LivDem intervention helpful, concerns remain about the continued need for support by a Dementia specialist.

Three professional panels were held and were attended by 9 professionals; nine carers but no patients were involved in the three peer panels.

clinic staff with limited previous experience of group therapy were trained to lead a 10-week group therapy intervention called 'Living Well with Dementia'. Fifty-eight participants, all of whom had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, vascular or Lewy body dementia within the previous 18 months, were randomised to receive either the intervention or treatment as usual (waiting-list control). Data collection occurred at baseline, within two weeks after the intervention finished and at 10-week follow-up.","The study met its recruitment targets, with a relatively low attrition rate for the intervention arm. The acceptability of the intervention and research methods was examined qualitatively and will be reported on elsewhere. For the primary outcome, measure of quality of life in Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD), and secondary outcome, self-esteem, there was some evidence of improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group. There was, also, evidence of a reduction in cognitive functioning in the treatment group compared to the control. Such reported differences should be treated with caution because they are obtained from a pilot and not a definitive study.","This pilot study succeeded in collecting data to inform a future definitive cost effectiveness clinical trial of Living Well with Dementia group therapy."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Marshall","ForeName":"Ann","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spreadbury","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cheston","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coleman","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballinger","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mullee","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pritchard","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Russell","ForeName":"Cynthia","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bartlett","ForeName":"Elizabeth","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"PB-PG-0610-22005","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"09","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Acceptance of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy, Group","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"},{"DescriptorName":"Waiting Lists"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer's disease","dementia","group psychotherapy","psychosocial support system","recovery"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"9","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"9","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"10","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25196239","10.1080\/13607863.2014.954527"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24586094","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"The paradox of dementia: Changes in assimilation after receiving a diagnosis of dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"181-203"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301214520781","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore how six people talked about their difficulties before and after a dementia diagnosis. Participants' accounts of their memory problems were analysed in terms of the verbal Markers of Assimilation of Problematic Voices Scale. This analysis indicated that after diagnosis some participants were able to integrate aspects of their illness that had previously been too painful, and which had been warded off. The process by which individuals were able to integrate a dementia diagnosis into their sense of self-involved stepping in and out of awareness, with both acceptance and denial featuring in their accounts as they approached and then retreated from addressing the diagnosis. In contrast, other participants resisted moving towards explicitly acknowledging their dementia but were instead able to express concerns about what this movement would entail, for instance voicing their fears that it would mean that they had surrendered. Social support seems to have been crucial in enabling participants to sustain a positive sense of self in the face of this adjustment.

Studying personal vulnerability factors in burnout is important as it can guide staff training and support. Attachment theory suggests that adult attachment styles affect caregiving relationships and individuals' responses to stress, providing a framework for understanding caregivers' styles of coping. This cross-sectional survey study examined relationships between staff attachment styles, geriatric nursing self-efficacy, and approaches to dementia in burnout. Seventy-seven members of dementia care staff working on inpatient wards for older people completed self-report questionnaires. Insecure attachment, lower levels of self-efficacy, and more optimistic attitudes in staff were related to higher levels of burnout. Staff training on the role of attachment in dementia care is recommended. Further research is required to explore mediating factors between adult attachment styles and burnout.

While attachment theory in dementia has been well studied, there have been no systematic investigations of the way in which transitional objects are used by people with dementia. This study explores the relationship people with dementia have with physical objects using a focussed ethnographic method. Twenty-one residents and the staff of a care home for people with dementia were observed over a two-month period. Observations were recorded and analysed in light of Winnicott's criteria for transitional objects and incorporated the work of other key theorists. The ethnography found evidence that people with dementia have varied relationships with objects and can employ objects in a transitional way. The paper then explores the implications of this research for understanding the function of transitional objects for people with dementia. The findings suggest that that Winnicott's theory of transitional objects can provide a framework for understanding some of the processes of dementia.
