A crisis may also resolve spontaneously, or not resolve after receiving professional support. Because of the intensity of the crisis, the extent to which the person engages in decision making for their own care is often decreased. In UK mental health services, 'crisis teams' work to avert the breakdown of support arrangements and to avoid admissions to hospital or long-term care where possible. This study aimed to explore the views of crisis teams about promoting the involvement of the person with dementia in decision-making at all points in the care pathway, here defined as co-production. The staff of crisis teams from three NHS Trusts in the UK were interviewed through focus groups. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Three focus groups were run with 22 staff members. Data clustered around strategies used to promote the active involvement of the person with dementia, and the challenges experienced when delivering the care. Staff members reported that achieving a therapeutic relationship was fundamental to successful co-production. Miscommunication and\/or lack of proper contact between the team and the individuals and carers receiving support adversely affected the quality of care. Making service users aware of the support provided by crisis teams before they need this may help promote a positive therapeutic relationship and effective care management."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bosco","ForeName":"Alessandro","Initials":"A","Identifier":"0000-0002-2374-3427","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schneider","ForeName":"Justine","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0002-5863-7747","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Sociology and Social Policy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Di Lorito","ForeName":"Claudio","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Rehabilitation, Ageing and Wellbeing, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Broome","ForeName":"Emma","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Hearing Sciences, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coleston-Shields","ForeName":"Donna Maria","Initials":"DM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2TU, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"28"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Switzerland","MedlineTA":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","NlmUniqueID":"101238455","ISSNLinking":"1660-4601"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Crisis Intervention"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health Services"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["co-production","crisis teams","dementia","focus group"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2020","Month":"06","Day":"18"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"24"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"25"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2020","Month":"8","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2020","Month":"8","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"11","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["32731341","ijerph17155412","10.3390\/ijerph17155412","PMC7432219"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Ann Intern Med. 2011 Mar 1;154(5):336-46","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21357911"}},{"Citation":"Clin Interv Aging. 2017 Oct 03;12:1589-1603","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"29042760"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2013 Feb 01;13:10","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23374634"}},{"Citation":"J Alzheimers Dis. 2018;62(1):99-113","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"29439334"}},{"Citation":"Qual Health Care. 2001 Jun;10(2):70-5","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11389314"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2006 Dec;56(5):491-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17078825"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2019 Jun;23(6):651-659","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"29543501"}},{"Citation":"Biometrics. 1977 Jun;33(2):363-74","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"884196"}},{"Citation":"Int J Palliat Nurs. 2017 Jan 2;23(1):4-11","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"28132606"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2016 Jun;31(6):638-47","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26489696"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"31351517","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"17"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1873-4111","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"127","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Maturitas","ISOAbbreviation":"Maturitas"},"ArticleTitle":"What indicators have been used to evaluate the impact of music on the health and wellbeing of people with dementia?

Although there is a rapidly growing amount of research in this relatively new area, it has evolved largely independently within different fields, such as psychology, music therapy and nursing. Using principles from the meta-narrative review method, this paper systematically surveys the qualitative and quantitative measures which have been used in studies relating to music and dementia from 1980 to the present day. Data extracted include the outcome measures used, the type of musical interventions, the setting of the studies, and methodology and study design. The quantitative studies greatly outnumber the qualitative studies, and most research has been done in long-term care settings. Instruments which measure neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, especially agitation, were the most frequently used. Other domains that were targeted in the studies included quality of life, physiological change, music-related outcomes and cognitive skills; the inter-relations between these domains are represented as a diagram. Researchers' rationales for choosing to target these outcomes are discussed. Although reduction of neuropsychiatric symptoms is a valuable outcome, it is important that researchers are open to the possibility of other outcomes. We suggest that measuring an increase in positive responses might be an alternative to measuring a reduction of negative symptoms, and we highlight the importance of listening to people with dementia and carers when designing studies.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This support is usually provided by family members who are sometimes legally empowered to engage in decision-making on behalf of the person for whom they care. However, such family carers receive little or no information on how to best provide support when there is a lack of capacity. This may have an impact on the agency of the person with dementia. This review explores the experience of agency in people living with dementia.","A systematic search was conducted on IBSS, MedLine, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Two independent researchers screened the studies and conducted the quality appraisal. We used meta-ethnography for data analysis. As part of the synthesis, we identified behavioral mechanisms underlying the process of decision-making and looked at how the support of carers comes into play in making deliberate choices.","The meta-ethnography involved 20 studies. Three levels of third-order constructs were identified, each describing a decision-making pathway and reflecting the degree of autonomy of the person with dementia: autonomous decision-making, shared decision-making, and pseudo decision-making.

Healthcare professionals lack confidence in dementia communication skills, but there are no evidence-based communication skills training approaches appropriate for professionals working in this context. We aimed to develop and pilot a dementia communication skills training course that was acceptable and useful to healthcare professionals, hospital patients and their relatives.","The course was developed using conversation analytic findings from video recordings of healthcare professionals talking to patients living with dementia in the acute hospital, together with systematic review evidence of dementia communication skills training and taking account of expert and service-user opinion. The two-day course was based on experiential learning theory, and included simulation and video workshops, reflective diaries and didactic teaching. Actors were trained to portray patients living with dementia for the simulation exercises. Six courses were run between January and May 2017. 44\/45 healthcare professionals attended both days of the course. Evaluation entailed: questionnaires on confidence in dementia communication; a dementia communication knowledge test; and participants' satisfaction. Video-recorded, simulated assessments were used to measure changes in communication behaviour.","Healthcare professionals increased their knowledge of dementia communication (mean improvement 1.5\/10; 95% confidence interval 1.0-2.0; p<0.001). Confidence in dementia communication also increased (mean improvement 5.5\/45; 95% confidence interval 4.1-6.9; p<0.001) and the course was well-received.

highlights the potential of psychosocial interventions to alleviate the effects of dementia and enhance quality of life. With reference to a manifesto from the researcher network Interdem, this paper shows how arts activities correspond to its definition of psycho-social care. It presents key dimensions that help to define different arts activities in this context, and illustrates the arts with reference to three major approaches that can be viewed online; visual art, music and dance. It goes on to discuss the features of each of these arts activities, and to present relevant evidence from systematic reviews on the arts in dementia in general. Developing the analysis into a template for differentiating arts interventions in dementia, the paper goes on to discuss implications for future research and for the uptake of the arts by people with dementia as a means to self-care."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schneider","ForeName":"Justine","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0002-5863-7747","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Sociology & Social Policy and Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG9 2HA, UK.

Eligible studies employed qualitative or mixed method design, reported the experience of dyads of dementia with no comorbid organic or psychiatric disorders. No restrictions were made on language, year of publication, sex or age of participants. Two independent researchers conducted the quality appraisal of studies. We synthesise data through meta-ethnography and developed a behavioural model to explain dyadic interaction.","Seventeen studies were included in the review. The meta-ethnography generated two third-order constructs: Personal orientation and noises. When people with dementia and their carers have dyadic-oriented goals, their behavioural responses may promote positive interaction. When only one partner has dyadic goals, context-related stress may affect the interaction, because of no perceived shared understanding of the situation.","Our findings suggest that unequal power distribution within dyads, can cause significant stress, when coping strategies are impaired.

dementia. There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)].

biomedical discourses of progressive and inevitable loss of insight, capacity, and personality. Proponents of person-centred care, by contrast, suggest that such loss can be mitigated within environments that preserve rather than undermine personhood. In formal organisational settings, person-centred approaches place particular responsibility on 'empowered' direct-care staff to translate these principles into practice. These staff provide the majority of hands-on care, but with limited training, recognition, or remuneration. Working within a Foucauldian understanding of power, this paper examines the complex ways that dementia care staff engage with their own 'dis\/empowerment' in everyday practice. The findings, which are drawn from ethnographic studies of three National Health Service (NHS) wards and one private care home in England, are presented as a narrative exploration of carers' general experience of powerlessness, their inversion of this marginalised subject positioning, and the related possibilities for action. The paper concludes with a discussion of how Foucault's understanding of power may help define and enhance efforts to empower direct-care staff to provide person-centred care in formal dementia care settings.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scales","ForeName":"Kezia","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development, Duke University, USA."},{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing, Duke University, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bailey","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Middleton","ForeName":"Joanne","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schneider","ForeName":"Justine","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Sociology & Social Policy, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Sociol Health Illn","NlmUniqueID":"8205036","ISSNLinking":"0141-9889"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Anthropology, Cultural"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Power, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Care"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Foucault","dementia","ethnography","person-centred care","power"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27891628","10.1111\/1467-9566.12524"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25425445","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"'Singing for the Brain': A qualitative study exploring the health and well-being benefits of singing for people with dementia and their carers.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1326-1339"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Dementia has detrimental effects on cognitive, psychological and behavioural functioning, as well as significant impact on those who provide care.

This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with people with dementia and their carers. Ten interviews involving 20 participants were analysed thematically.

to stage of a work of theatre based on an ethnographic study. The originating research focused on the work of health care assistants (nurse's aides) whose direct impact on the quality of life of highly dependent people is often overlooked. The research followed hospital personnel on wards specialising in the 'challenging behaviour' associated with dementia in central England. Conventional research outputs failed to engage the health care assistants themselves, so we turned to theatre to remedy this. The development of the field notes into theatre was characterised by the artistic freedom given to the playwright, in contrast to more data-led approaches to theatre making. The account of the process of creating the play, Inside Out of Mind, is followed a description of how the work was received by specialist and general audiences totalling 2000+. The discussion seeks to locate the whole enterprise in relation to the field of research-based theatre and explores how the production and its associated learning events relate to definitions of research-based theatre in the light of recent attempts to encapsulate this broad and diverse methodology.

High levels of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms at baseline were associated with more carer strain and distress. At follow-up, carer strain and distress had reduced only slightly, with no difference in outcomes for carers of patients who moved from the community to a care home.","Hospital staff should be alert to sources of carer strain and offer carers practical advice and emotional support. Interventions are required to prevent and manage behavioural and psychiatric symptoms at the time of acute physical illness or to alleviate their effects on carers."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright

is likely to increase pressures on healthcare services, making effective well coordinated care imperative. Yet, barriers to this care approach exist which, we argue, might be understood by focussing on identity dynamics at the frontlines of care. In this article, we draw upon findings from an ethnographic study of healthcare assistants (HCAs) from three dementia wards across one National Health Service mental health trust. Data revealed that the HCAs are a close-knit 'in-group' who share low group status and norms and, often highlight their own expertise in order to promote self worth. HCAs' social identity is considered as a barrier to effective teamwork with strong ingroup behaviour suggested as a consequence of their marginalisation. We explore these findings with reference to social identity theory (Tajfel, 1974; Turner, 1978 ) and discuss implications for delivering multiprofessional and interprofessional care."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"V Lloyd","ForeName":"Joanne","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical Psychology and Neuropsychology, Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. joanne.lloyd@nuh.nhs.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schneider","ForeName":"Justine","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scales","ForeName":"Kezia","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bailey","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Rob","Initials":"R"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"06","Day":"02"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Interprof Care","NlmUniqueID":"9205811","ISSNLinking":"1356-1820"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Aging Ment Health. 2017 Jul;21(7):758-760","PMID":"28282735"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Allied Health Personnel","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Anthropology, Cultural"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Efficiency, Organizational"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Inpatients"},{"DescriptorName":"Interprofessional Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care Team"},{"DescriptorName":"Prejudice"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychological Theory"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Efficacy"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Identification"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"6","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"6","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21635181","10.3109\/13561820.2011.567381"]}}}]}
