Predisposing, enabling, and need variables were investigated to find out whether there is equitable access to dementia-specific formal care services. Results can identify which specific factors should be a target to improve access.","A total of 451 People with middle-stage dementia and their informal carers from eight European countries were included. At baseline, there was no use of formal care yet, but people were expected to start using formal care within the next year. Logistic regressions were carried out with one of four clusters of service use as dependent variables (home social care, home personal care, day care, admission). The independent variables (predisposing, enabling, and need variables) were added to the regression in blocks.","The most significant predictors for the different care clusters are disease severity, a higher sum of (un)met needs, hours spent on informal care, living alone, age, region of residence, and gender.","The Andersen model provided for this cohort the insight that (besides need factors) the predisposing variables region of residence, gender, and age do play a role in finding access to care. In addition, it showed us that the numbers of hours spent on informal care, living alone, needs, and disease severity are also important predictors within the model's framework. Health care professionals should pay attention to these predisposing factors to ensure that they do not become barriers for those in need for care."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

experiences, attitudes, barriers and facilitators concerning access to and use of formal care. A total of 85 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted in eight European countries. Results were analysed with a deductive content analysis, first within country and then integrated in a cross-national analysis. Overall, analysis of the in-depth interviews revealed two major themes with five subcategories. The results can be summarised in an optimal pathway for access to dementia care. This pathway includes fixed factors such as disease-related factors and system-related factors. In addition there are personal factors that are subject to change such as attitudes towards care. An important finding consisted of the necessity of having sufficient information about the disease and available care and having a key contact person to guide you through the process of finding suitable care while monitoring your needs. In addition, it is important to involve your social network as they can take on care-giving tasks. It is helpful to have a diagnosis (in most countries). Concerning decision-making, the person closest to the person with dementia is in the majority of cases the one who makes the ultimate decision to access and use services and he\/she should therefore be supported in this process. These results provide insight into the factors that influence the pathway to formal care use and help professionals to enhance access to formal dementia care by focusing on factors that can be modified.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Ten PWD in one nursing home took part in a 4-week pilot study, where each participant had up to 12 sessions with MARIO. Sessions comprised engagement in music, news, reminiscence, games, and calendar applications. Standardized questionnaires were administered before and after the 4-week period. Participants had a sustained interest in MARIO during their interactions and an acceptance of MARIO's appearance, sound, and applications. Consequently, participants spent more time socially engaged. No statistically significant differences were found in quality of life, depression, and perceived social support. PWD can engage with a social robot in a real-world nursing home.

No significant differences in the overall perception of RQ were evident between spouses and adult children carers, but RQ determinants differed between the two.","In this European sample, carer SOC was associated with carer-reported RQ. RQ determinants differed according to the perspective considered (person with dementia or carer) and carer subgroup. A deeper understanding of RQ and its determinants will help to tailor interventions that address these distinct perspectives and potentially improve dementia outcomes."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9

of untimely access is needed.","To examine, from a societal perspective, the impact of untimely access to formal care in terms of total costs and quality of life over one year in community dwelling people with dementia.","Within the Actifcare study, needs, resource use, and quality of life were observed for one year in a cohort of 451 community dwelling people with dementia in 8 European countries. Untimely access to care was operationalized as having at least one unmet need for care identified by the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) instrument. Two regression models were built for both total costs and quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-5L, one using sum of unmet needs and one using a predefined selection of need items.","Unmet needs were not associated with higher total costs but they were associated with a lower quality of life of people with dementia. Of all CANE items, only an unmet need for \"company\" was significantly related to lower total costs.","Total costs did not seem to differ between participants with unmet and met needs. Only few associations between specific unmet needs and costs and quality of life were found. Furthermore, quality of life of people with dementia decreases when multiple unmet needs are experienced, indicating that assessing and meeting needs is important to improve quality of life."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Janssen","ForeName":"Niels","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

The barriers and facilitators to service use from the perspectives of different stakeholders involved are not well understood. Thus, we aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of access to and utilisation of formal care from the perspectives of people with dementia, their informal carers and health and social care professionals.","Focus groups with people with dementia, informal carers and professionals were conducted in eight European countries. Recruitment targeted people with dementia, informal carers with experience of formal care and professionals involved in providing (access to) formal care. Qualitative content analysis using open coding was used on a national level. Cross-national synthesis was based on the translated national reports.","Overall, 55 focus groups with 261 participants were conducted, involving 51 people with dementia, 96 informal carers and 114 professionals. Sixteen categories describing barriers and facilitators were identified, referring to three global themes: Aspects related to 1) individuals involved, 2) the system or 3) overarching aspects. The attitudes and beliefs of people with dementia and their carers may have a major impact, and they often serve as barriers. Formal care was perceived as a threat to the individual independence of people with dementia and was thus avoided as long as possible. A healthcare professional serving as a constant key contact person could be an essential facilitator to overcome these barriers. Contact should be initiated proactively, as early as possible, and a trusting and consistent relationship needs to be established. Beyond that, the findings largely confirm former research and show that barriers to accessing and using formal care still exist across Europe despite a number of national and European initiatives.","Further investigations are needed to elaborate how the concept of a key contact person could be integrated with existing case management approaches and how the independence and autonomy of people with dementia can be strengthened when formal care needs to be accessed and used. These may be meaningful facilitators regarding enhanced access to formal care for people with dementia and their families."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Astrid","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, 06112, Halle (Saale), Germany. astrid.stephan@medizin.uni-halle.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, 06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joyce","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Unit, IRCCS S.

The interview guide addressed the topics \"Complexity and Continuity of Care\", \"Formal Services\", and \"Public Awareness\". Country-specific analysis of interview transcripts used an inductive qualitative content analysis. Cross-national synthesis focused on similarities in themes across the ActifCare countries.","The analysis revealed ten common themes and two additional sub-themes across countries. Among others, the experts highlighted the need for a coordinating role and the necessity of information to address issues of complexity and continuity of care, demanded person-centred, tailored, and multidisciplinary formal services, and referred to education, mass media and campaigns as means to raise public awareness.","Policy and political decision makers appear well acquainted with current discussions among both researchers and practitioners of possible approaches to improve access to dementia care. Experts described pragmatic, realistic strategies to influence dementia care. Suggested innovations concerned how to achieve improved dementia care, rather than transforming the nature of the services provided. Knowledge gained in these expert interviews may be useful to national decision makers when they consider reshaping the organisation of dementia care, and may thus help to develop best-practice strategies and recommendations."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Broda","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2564-6521","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany. anja.broda@medizin.uni-halle.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Meyer","ForeName":"Gabriele","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joyce","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"IRCCS S.

moderate dementia and to investigate differences between identified caregiver profiles, using baseline data of the international prospective cohort study Actifcare.","A latent class analysis was used to discover different caregiver profiles based on disease related characteristics of 453 persons with dementia and their 453 informal caregivers. These profiles were compared with regard to quality of life (CarerQoL score), depressive symptoms (HADS-D score) and perseverance time.","A 5-class model was identified, with the best Bayesian Information Criterion value, significant likelihood ratio test (p < 0.001), high entropy score (0.88) and substantive interpretability. The classes could be differentiated on two axes: (i) caregivers' age, relationship with persons with dementia, severity of dementia, and (ii) tendency towards stress and difficulty adapting to stress. Classes showed significant differences with all dependent variables, and were labelled 'older low strain', 'older intermediate strain', 'older high strain', 'younger low strain' and 'younger high strain'.","Differences exist between types of caregivers that explain variability in quality of life, depressive symptoms and perseverance time. Our findings may give direction for tailored interventions for caregivers of persons with dementia, which may improve social health and reduce health care costs."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Janssen","ForeName":"Eveline P C J","Initials":"EP","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology , School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"b Department of Old Age Psychiatry , Mondriaan , Heerlen , The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Vugt","ForeName":"Marjolein","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology , School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"K\u00f6hler","ForeName":"Sebastian","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology , School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wolfs","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology , School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kerpershoek","ForeName":"Liselot","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology , School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Handels","ForeName":"Ron L H","Initials":"RL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology , School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center , Maastricht , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c Department of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences , Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham , Nottingham , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"d Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , Bangor University , Bango , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jelley","ForeName":"Hannah","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"d Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , Bangor University , Bango , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Astrid","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"e Medical Faculty , Institute for Health and Nursing Science , Halle-Wittenberg , Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"e Medical Faculty , Institute for Health and Nursing Science , Halle-Wittenberg , Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Meyer","ForeName":"Gabriele","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"e Medical Faculty , Institute for Health and Nursing Science , Halle-Wittenberg , Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Engedal","ForeName":"Knut","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"f Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health , Vestfold Hospital Trust , T\u00f8nsberg , Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Selbaek","ForeName":"Geir","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"f Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health , Vestfold Hospital Trust , T\u00f8nsberg , Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wimo","ForeName":"Anders","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"g Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society , Karolinska Institut , Stockholm , Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"h School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University , Dublin , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"h School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University , Dublin , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gon\u00e7alves-Pereira","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"i CEDOC -

This mismatch causes overall dissatisfaction and is a waste of the scarce financial care resources. This article presents the background and methods of the Actifcare (ACcess to Timely Formal Care) project. This is a European study aiming at best-practice development in finding timely access to formal care for community-dwelling people with dementia and their informal carers. There are five main objectives: 1) Explore predisposing and enabling factors associated with the use of formal care, 2) Explore the association between the use of formal care, needs and quality of life and 3) Compare these across European countries, 4) Understand the costs and consequences of formal care services utilization in people with unmet needs, 5) Determine the major costs and quality of life drivers and their relationship with formal care services across European countries.","In a longitudinal cohort study conducted in eight European countries approximately 450 people with dementia and informal carers will be assessed three times in 1\u00a0year (baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months). In this year we will closely monitor the process of finding access to formal care. Data on service use, quality of life and needs will be collected.","The results of Actifcare are expected to reveal best-practices in organizing formal care. Knowledge about enabling and predisposing factors regarding access to care services, as well as its costs and consequences, can advance the state of the art in health systems research into pathways to dementia care, in order to benefit people with dementia and their informal carers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kerpershoek","ForeName":"Liselot","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maastricht
