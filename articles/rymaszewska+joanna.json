In the case of people with dementia, the compliance with sanitary recommendations and the necessary physical isolation can have far-reaching negative consequences in terms of limiting the continuation of tailored care, support and treatment. The recommendations related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic must take into account not only the medical consequences of lack of access to medical care, but also their long-term effects and the disease progression in accordance with the concept of social health. A plan of action for the psychoeducation of informal carers, adapted to the elderly group (including people with dementia), is also necessary. Prepared under the auspices of the Polish Psychiatric Association, the recommendations for people living alone, with their family and in long-term care facilities are intended to draw attention to key epidemiological issues that can be planned by medical staff within the organization of patient care. However, mental and social needs of patients, whose fulfilment is particularly significant in times of restrictions related to everyday activities, are of equal importance. Further monitoring of the epidemiological situation and scientific reports related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are necessary to verify and update the guidelines."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"\u0141uc","ForeName":"Mateusz","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Current treatment of AD - the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors - provides temporary improvement of cognitive functions, but does not affect the core of the underlying pathological process. There is still the need for alternative approaches, preferably ones based on the upstream events in the AD pathogenesis. The nature of AD pathogenesis remains complicated and not entirely explained. It is assumed to comprise of many interrelated events which can sequentially lead to further pathologies - as a kind of vicious cycle. The solution in this case could be to interact with these processes on multiple levels at the same time. The proposed approach hopes to achieve the state of equilibrium between two pathological pathways via reducing their dynamics on appropriate levels. The first step is to inhibit Tumor Necrosis Factor signaling related to inflammatory response. The second is to take advantage of the influence of insulin signaling on amyloid-\u03b2 processing to restore its proper clearance. Employing two only partially-beneficial approaches into a novel approach aims at breaking the \"vicious cycle\" and eliciting synergistic effect via working on different levels simultaneously. The effect of such therapy could allow physicians to completely inhibit neural damage. The proposed strategy may prove easily introducible as an efficacious clinical approach employing novel anti-TNF agents in combination with anti-diabetic agents. Data is needed on its influence on cognitive functions, any occurrence of adverse effects, and the development of models of optimal doses and their temporal location.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

The history of the EL method development is presented as well as techniques used in its domain. The novelty of the EL methodological approach is shown. It is emphasized that EL, in contrast with the majority of neuropsychological rehabilitation strategies, has a relatively reliable theoretical basis. The remaining part of the work focuses on reviewing empirical findings concerning the effectiveness of employing Errorless Learning in rehabilitation of individuals suffering from AD, which are available in the professional literature. Factors affecting it, such as rehabilitation session organization, frequency of participants' advancements testing and a type of practiced material, are discussed. The effectiveness of EL is compared with the results of other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods.

Within the framework of the JPND-MEETINGDEM implementation project the pathways to regular day-care activities and the Meeting Centers Support Programme (MCSP), an innovative combined support form for people with dementia and carers, was explored.","An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative, cross-country design was applied to investigate the pathways to day care in several regions in four European countries (Italy, Poland, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands).","Before implementation of MCSP, of the four countries the United Kingdom had the most structured pathway to post-diagnostic support for people with dementia. MCSP introduction had a positive impact on the pathways to day-care activities in all countries. MCSP filled an important gap in post-diagnostic care, increasing the accessibility to support for both people with dementia and carers. Key elements such as program of activities, target group, and collaboration between healthcare and social services were recognized as success factors.","This study shows that MCSP fills (part of) the gap between diagnosis and residential care and can therefore be seen as a pillar of post-diagnostic care and support.

Transgenic technologies have enabled the creation of animal models based on mutations in APP, MAPT, presenilin genes, tau protein and apoE. Due to economic reasons studies are mainly conducted on mice. Their brain tissue, depending on the mutation, is characterized by histopathological changes, such as the presence of amyloid plaques, tau protein deposits and dystrophic neurites, gliosis, hippocampal atrophy and amyloid accumulation in vessels. Animal cognitive impairment and behavior, which can be demonstrated in behavioral tests, primarily relate to the working and reference memory, alternation and anxiety. Unfortunately, despite the various modifications specific to AD in the genome of animals, scientists have failed to create an animal model characterized by all the pathological changes that can occur in Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, the role of transgenic animals is undeniable, both in research on AD neuropathology and for testing new therapies, such as immunotherapy. Despite the occurrence of abundant Alzheimer's disease mice models this article is dedicated to selected models with mutations in the APP, MAPT and presenilin genes and their application for behavioral studies."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wi\u0119d\u0142ocha","ForeName":"Magdalena","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Projekt POIG pn.
