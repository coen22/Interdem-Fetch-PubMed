The co-occurrence of the two conditions increases complexities in all aspects of an individual's care and management plan. There has been increasing research interest in the relationship between dementia and hearing loss in recent years. In this review we discuss the relationship between hearing loss and dementia, including hearing loss as a risk factor for dementia; the effects of dementia with hearing loss on affected persons' quality of life and the care they receive; screening and available interventions; and opportunities for prevention. We also discuss dementia and hearing loss in the care home setting, as the majority of residents have either, or indeed both, dementia and\/or hearing loss. Several mechanisms have been suggested for how hearing loss and dementia may be related but the evidence for how these may operate together is still unclear. Similarly, although it is to be hoped that the active identification and management of hearing problems may help to reduce the future development of cognitive impairment, evidence for this is still lacking.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To address this need, the Journeying through Dementia (JtD) intervention was created. A randomised controlled trial (RCT), based on a pilot study, is in progress.","The RCT is a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel group trial designed to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of JtD compared with usual care. Recruitment will be through NHS services, third sector organisations and Join Dementia Research. The sample size is 486 randomised (243 to usual care and 243 to the intervention usual care). Participants can choose to ask a friend or relative (supporter) to become involved in the study. The primary outcome measure for participants is Dementia-Related Quality of Life (DEMQOL), collected at baseline and at 8 months' postrandomisation. Secondary outcome measures will be collected from participants and supporters at those visits. Participants will also be followed up at 12 months' postrandomisation with a reduced set of measures. A process evaluation will be conducted through qualitative and fidelity substudies. Analyses will compare the two arms of the trial on an intention to treat as allocated basis. The primary analyses will compare the mean DEMQOL scores of the participants at 8 months between the two study arms. A cost-effectiveness analysis will consider the incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years of the intervention compared with usual care. Qualitative and fidelity substudies will be analysed through framework analysis and fidelity assessment tools respectively.","REC and HRA approval were obtained. A Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee has been constituted. Dissemination will be via publications, conferences and social media.

Cultural consensus analysis was used to detail variations in approaches to dementia care between staff subgroups.","The most salient listed descriptions of care emphasised by staff members with personal experience of dementia caregiving when compared with staff members without such experience, and descriptions from staff newer to the profession compared with staff with more years of professional dementia caregiving experience.","Subgroups of hospital staff showed different patterns of responses both in how they noticed the emotional distress of patients with dementia, and in prioritised responses that they deemed to work. Hospital staff with professional experience of dementia caregiving and staff with fewer years of professional experience prioritised mutual communication and getting to know each patient.","Subgroups of hospital staff with personal caregiving experiences and fewer years of professional care experience were more likely to describe person-centred care as their routine ways of working with patients with dementia.

Research addressing these challenges must be multidisciplinary, taking account of humanities and science perspectives. Consequently, this research aimed to produce a taxonomy, or classification, of arts interventions for people with dementia as a contribution to this growing field.","This research was underpinned by taxonomy and realist methodology. Taxonomy, the science of classification, produces a common language to name, define, and describe the world around us. Realist theory explains how interventions \"work\" and produce their effects. The main findings in this paper were generated from a case study and a Delphi study.","An arts and dementia taxonomy of 12 dimensions was developed: Art Form, Artistic elements, Artistic focus, Artistic materials, Arts activity, Arts approaches, Arts facilitators, Arts location, Competencies, Complementary arts, Intervention context, Principles.","Arts interventions can be classified according to their contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes. A range of stakeholders could benefit from the taxonomy, including people with dementia, artists, practitioners, carers, care staff, funders, commissioners, researchers, and academics. Language relating to the arts and dementia can be adapted depending on the audience.

This paper explores how care can be effective in optimising hearing communication for residents living with dementia. We argue that the underlying notion of permission or authorisation allows care staff to do what they know will be effective in providing person-centred care that enhances hearing communication. The paper also indicates that this notion of permission can usefully be applied to other areas of care home practice.","To address hearing-related communication in care homes, we conducted a realist synthesis (RS). As a theory-driven approach to reviewing literature, it also uses expert opinion to understand complex health situations. Using RS, we developed a theory surrounding the management of hearing-related communication in care homes. Applying formal processes to the literature search and data extraction, the analysis uncovered relevant mechanisms and contexts to help confirm, refute or refine our understanding of how hearing communication could be improved.","Forty-three papers were selected for the realist synthesis. The documents were analysed to construct five context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs). The CMOCs represent possible care interventions to optimise hearing-related communication in care homes for person living with dementia and hearing loss (PLWDHL). They include leadership promoting positive regard and empathy through person-centred care, communication training for staff, 'knowing the person' and relationship building for responsive awareness of residents' hearing needs, maintaining and monitoring hearing communication through care planning, and managing noise in the care home environment.","Leadership that provides appropriate training and resources is likely to enhance knowledge and skills, leading to staff feeling able and equipped to respond to the hearing-related communication needs of PLWDHL. Collaboration with local hearing services is likely to raise awareness of hearing loss among care home staff. Importantly, care staff require a sense of permission from leadership, to work with knowledge and autonomy in the interest of residents living with dementia and hearing loss."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Crosbie","ForeName":"Brian","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of

physical and emotional well-being. Hospital staff are expected to understand and respond to the emotions of the patient; however, it is not known how this can be achieved. We provide a concise description of achievable emotion-focused care for patients with dementia.","Exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted with a whole U.K. hospital ward providing dementia care, constituting 47 staff members. Staff responded to four questions using ethnographic freelisting. They listed (a) all the ways they notice the emotional distress of patients with dementia, (b) the causes of emotional distress, (c) all the ways they respond, and (d) the responses that seem to work. Cultural consensus analysis was applied.","A single-factor solution for each question indicated a consensus approach to emotional distress. Emotional distress was noticed from agitation (Smith's saliency score, 0.418), crying (0.350), and increased mobilizing (0.238). The main causes of distress were the unfamiliar hospital environment (0.355) and not knowing what is happening (0.313). The most effective ways to respond to emotional distress required knowing the person (0.299), talking (0.283), and being with the person (0.269).","The findings expand what is understood of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia; these communicated emotional distress with well-understood causes. Prioritized ways of responding to emotional distress described person-centered care. The results offer a menu of options for providing emotionally responsive care for patients with dementia in hospital.

This review updates an earlier version, first published in 2002.","To determine the efficacy and safety of any type of antidepressant for patients who have been diagnosed as having dementia of any type and depression as defined by recognised criteria.","We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 16 August 2017. ALOIS contains information on trials retrieved from databases and from a number of trial registers and grey literature sources.","We included all relevant double-blind, randomised trials comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo, for patients diagnosed as having dementia and depression.","Two review authors selected studies for inclusion and extracted data independently. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Where clinically appropriate, we pooled data for treatment periods up to three months and from three to nine months. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence.","We included ten studies with a total of 1592 patients. Eight included studies reported sufficiently detailed results to enter into analyses related to antidepressant efficacy. We split one study which included two different antidepressants and therefore had nine groups of patients treated with antidepressants compared with nine groups receiving placebo treatment. Information needed to make 'Risk of bias' judgements was often missing.We found high-quality evidence of little or no difference in scores on depression symptom rating scales between the antidepressant and placebo treated groups after 6 to 13 weeks (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.06; 614 participants; 8 studies). There was probably also little or no difference between groups after six to nine months (mean difference (MD) 0.59 point, 95% CI -1.12 to 2.3, 357 participants; 2 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence on response rates at 12 weeks was of low quality, and imprecision in the result meant we were uncertain of any effect of antidepressants (antidepressant: 49.1%, placebo: 37.7%; odds ratio (OR) 1.71, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.67; 116 participants; 3 studies). However, the remission rate was probably higher in the antidepressant group than the placebo group (antidepressant: 40%, placebo: 21.7%; OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.59; 240 participants; 4 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The largest of these studies continued for another 12 weeks, but because of imprecision of the result we could not be sure of any effect of antidepressants on remission rates after 24 weeks. There was evidence of no effect of antidepressants on performance of activities of daily living at weeks 6 to 13 (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.25; 173 participants; 4 studies; high-quality evidence) and probably also little or no effect on cognition (MD 0.33 point on the Mini-Mental State Examination, 95% CI -1.31 to 1.96; 194 participants; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence).Participants on antidepressants were probably more likely to drop out of treatment than those on placebo over 6 to 13 weeks (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.14; 836 participants; 9 studies). The meta-analysis of the number of participants suffering at least one adverse event showed a significant difference in favour of placebo (antidepressant: 49.2%, placebo: 38.4%; OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.98, 1073 participants; 3 studies), as did the analyses for participants suffering one event of dry mouth (antidepressant: 19.6%, placebo: 13.3%; OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.63, 1044 participants; 5 studies), and one event of dizziness (antidepressant: 19.2%, placebo: 12.5%; OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.98, 1044 participants; 5 studies). Heterogeneity in the way adverse events were reported in studies presented a major difficulty for meta-analysis, but there was some evidence that antidepressant treatment causes more adverse effects than placebo treatment does.","The available evidence is of variable quality and does not provide strong support for the efficacy of antidepressants for treating depression in dementia, especially beyond 12 weeks. On the only measure of efficacy for which we had high-quality evidence (depression rating scale scores), antidepressants showed little or no effect. The evidence on remission rates favoured antidepressants but was of moderate quality, so future research may find a different result. There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about individual antidepressant drugs or about subtypes of dementia or depression. There is some evidence that antidepressant treatment may cause adverse events."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dudas","ForeName":"Robert","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

that draws on medical ethnography, human geography and Geospatial Information Science (GIS) to address the issues surrounding the design and delivery of dementia-friendly services in rural communities. The research question seeks to understand the barriers and drivers to the development of relevant, robust, reliable and accessible services that make a difference among older rural families affected by dementia.","This mixed methods study recruits both families affected by dementia who reside within the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire, and their service providers. The study explores the expectations and experiences of rural dementia by adopting a three-part approach  : longitudinal ethnographic enquiry with up to 32 families affected by dementia (aged 70 years plus) who identify themselves as rural residents  ; ethnographic semistructured interviews and systematic observations of a range of statutory, third sector, private and local community initiatives that seek to support older people living with dementia  ; and geospatial visual mapping of the qualitative and quantitative data. The ethnographic data will be used to explore the ideas of belonging in a community, perceptions of place and identity to determine the factors that influence everyday decisions about living well with dementia and, for the providers, working in a rural community. The geospatial component of the study seeks to incorporate quantitative and qualitative data, such as types, locations and allocation of services to produce an interactive web-based map for local communities to determine the future design and delivery of services when considering dementia-friendly services.","The study is approved by the Leeds and Humberside Health Research Authority 16\/YH\/0163. The study is also approved by other participating organisations as required by their own governance procedures. The study includes people with dementia and as such adheres to the ethical considerations when including people with dementia. A publicly available interactive visual map of the findings will be produced in relation to current services related to location and, by default, identify gaps in provision. Formal reports and dissemination activities will be undertaken in collaboration with the study advisory group members.","The recruitment began in September 2016. The data analysis commenced June 2017, using 59 provider interviews and 27 family participants. Data collection will be completed June 2018.","Please note that the term 'families affected by dementia' is the preferred term of usage by the family members of the Scaling the Peaks Study Advisory Group. The group wish to emphasise that they consider this term to be more representative of their lives than the term living with dementia.","NIHR IRAS 188103; Pre-results."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

They can be either an enabler or an obstacle leading to social exclusion. The Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer gathered international experts of dementia care, with backgrounds in biomedical, human and social sciences, to analyze how assistive technologies can address the capabilities of people with dementia, on the basis of their needs. Discussion covered the unmet needs of people with dementia, the domains of daily life activities where assistive technologies can provide help to people with dementia, the enabling and empowering impact of technology to improve their safety and wellbeing, barriers and limits of use, technology assessment, ethical and legal issues. The capability approach (possible freedom) appears particularly relevant in person-centered dementia care and technology development. The focus is not on the solution, rather on what the person can do with it: seeing dementia as disability, with technology as an enabler to promote capabilities of the person, provides a useful framework for both research and practice. This article summarizes how these concepts took momentum in professional practice and public policies in the past 15 years (2000-2015), discusses current issues in the design, development and economic model of assistive technologies for people with dementia, and covers how these technologies are being used and assessed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kenigsberg","ForeName":"Paul-Ariel","Initials":"PA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aquino","ForeName":"Jean-Pierre","Initials":"JP","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"B\u00e9rard","ForeName":"Alain","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Br\u00e9mond","ForeName":"Fran\u00e7ois","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CoBTeK Lab & INRIA STARS, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te-d'Azur, Nice, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charras","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dro\u00ebs","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gzil","ForeName":"Fabrice","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hicks","ForeName":"Ben","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bournemouth University Dementia Institute, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Salford Institute for Dementia University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nguyen","ForeName":"Sao-Mai","Initials":"SM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Lab-STICC, Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pino","ForeName":"Maribel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Laboratoire Lusage, H\u00f4pital Broca, Assistance publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sacco","ForeName":"Guillaume","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche, CHU de Nice;

Improvements in pain management behaviour and staff confidence were seen in homes where training was delivered in a care home setting across the care team with good manager buy-in. Family involvement in pain management was highlighted as an area for improvement. Goal attainment in residents was significantly improved across the cohort, although no significant change in pain was seen.","This study shows good initial feasibility of the PAIN-Dem intervention and provides valuable insight into training and support paradigms that deliver successful learning and behaviour change. There is a need for a larger trial of PAIN-Dem to establish its impact on resident pain and quantifiable staff behaviour measures.

the language of \"suffering\" is contentious, making it suitable for debate. We speak of suffering, not to deny the positive aspects of life with dementia or to concentrate just on the negative, but to redress the balance that is disturbed by a relentlessly positive view of living with the condition.

This review explores if people with dementia experience greater adverse effects from antihypertensive medications, if cognitive function is protected or worsened by controlling blood pressure (BP) and if there are subgroups of people with dementia for whom antihypertensive therapy is more likely to be harmful. Robust evidence is scant, trials of antihypertensive medications have generally excluded those with dementia. Observational data show changes in risk association over the life course, with high BP being a risk factor for cognitive decline in mid-life, while low BP is predictive in later life. It is therefore possible that excessive BP lowering in older people with dementia might harm cognition. From the existing literature, there is no direct evidence of benefit or harm from treating hypertension in people with dementia. So what practical steps can the clinician take? Assess capacity, establish patient preferences when making treatment decisions, use ambulatory monitoring to thoroughly assess BP,\u00a0individualise and consider deprescribing where side effects (e.g. hypotension) outweigh the benefits. Future research might include pragmatic randomised trials of targeted deprescribing, which include patient-centred outcome measures to help support decision-making and studies to address mechanistic uncertainties.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author 2016.

dementia established by Notts County Football in the Community (NCFC). There were three aims: to investigate the effect of early onset dementia on individuals with the condition and their carers; to examine the perceptions of current levels of service provision for people with early onset dementia; and to analyse the impact of the group. Men with dementia (n\u2009=\u20095) attending the sessions, their carers (n\u2009=\u20095), NCFC coaching staff (n\u2009=\u20095) and people organizing\/facilitating the sessions (n\u2009=\u20095) were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews explored the participants' experiences of dementia, their opinions on current service provisions and on the sessions. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were found: loss related to the condition of dementia and its impact on relationships ('Loss'); lack of age-appropriate services for people with early onset dementia ('Lack of Resources'); enjoyment and positive anticipation related to the group for all involved ('Enjoyment and Anticipation'); and 'the Notts County Effect' which attributed the success of the sessions to the strong brand of the football club, and to personalized service in a \"dementia-free\" environment. The NCFC sessions provided a safe low-cost intervention with positive effects upon quality of life for both people with early onset dementia, their carers and the staff involved. This suggests that the service may be valuable to a wider range of people living in different areas.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carone","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Medicine, Nottingham, Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tischler","ForeName":"Victoria","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the Arts London - London College of Fashion, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK tom.dening@nottingham.ac.uk."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"26"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Mental Health Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Soccer"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","early onset dementia","football","men","quality of life","sporting activities"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25427788","1471301214560239","10.1177\/1471301214560239"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27771615","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"10"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"\"Here everyone is the same\" - A qualitative evaluation of participating in a Boccia (indoor bowling) group: Innovative practice.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"785-792"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301216675988","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This qualitative study explored the impact of a Boccia (modified indoor bowls) group on the lives of people with dementia and their carers.

patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, with little evidence to guide clinical decisions when symptoms become severe. We examined whether continuing donepezil, or commencing memantine, is cost-effective for community-dwelling, moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease patients.","Cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial. A total of 295 community-dwelling patients with moderate\/severe Alzheimer's disease, already treated with donepezil, were randomised to: (i) continue donepezil; (ii) discontinue donepezil; (iii) discontinue donepezil and start memantine; or (iv) continue donepezil and start memantine.","Continuing donepezil for 52\u2009weeks was more cost-effective than discontinuation, considering cognition, activities of daily living and health-related quality of life. Starting memantine was more cost-effective than donepezil discontinuation.

for people with dementia. Six themed boxes (e.g. Childhood) containing items chosen from the Boots archive designed to encourage conversation were used in weekly group sessions. Session participants were people with dementia and care staff from a local care home, a trained facilitator and archivists from Boots UK. Semi-structured interviews explored participants' experiences of the sessions. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. The three major themes Engagement (subthemes: Inclusiveness; Emotional involvement; Factors that supported engagement), What's in the box (subthemes: Contents stimulate memories; Mystery, variety and age of items; Value of olfactory stimuli), and A conversation starter (subtheme: Opportunity for self-expression) reveal the success of the intervention and the value of olfactory stimuli. Multisensory boxes including olfactory stimulation can be an engaging intervention with scope to refine it for people with dementia and their carers in the wider community."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffiths","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry & Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry & Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Beer","ForeName":"Charlotte","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry & Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tischler","ForeName":"Victoria","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry & Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"03"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Organizational Innovation"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Smell"},{"DescriptorName":"Touch"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["care homes","dementia","multisensory interventions","olfactory stimuli","people with dementia"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27697846","1471301216672495","10.1177\/1471301216672495"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27589586","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"08","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"12"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"11","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS One"},"ArticleTitle":"Who Lives Where and Does It Matter?

The proportion and profile of the older population living in such settings varies according to social, cultural, and economic characteristics as well as governmental policies. Changes in the profiles of people in different settings are important for policy makers and care providers. Although details will differ, how change occurs across time is important to all, including lower and middle income countries developing policies themselves. Here change is examined across two decades in England.","Using the two Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS I: 77% response, CFAS II: 56% response), two population based studies of older people carried out in the same areas conducted two decades apart, the study diagnosis of dementia using the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy, health and wellbeing were examined, focusing on long term care. The proportion of individuals with three or more health conditions increased for everyone living in long term care between CFAS I (47.6%, 95% CI: 42.3-53.1) and CFAS II (62.7%, 95% CI: 54.8-70.0) and was consistently higher in those without dementia compared to those with dementia in both studies. Functional impairment measured by activities of daily living increased in assisted living facilities from 48% (95% CI: 44%-52%) to 67% (95% CI: 62%-71%).","Health profiles of residents in long term care have changed dramatically over time. Dementia prevalence and reporting multiple health conditions have increased. Receiving care in the community puts pressure on unpaid carers and formal services; these results have implications for policies about supporting people at home as well as for service provision within long term care including quality of care, health management, cost, and the development of a skilled, caring, and informed workforce."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Matthews","ForeName":"Fiona E","Initials":"FE","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"MRC

with dementia are understood, and to improve the design and delivery of care interventions. A preliminary, incidental, finding from our initial systematic literature search is reported here. Increasingly, the experience of dementia is understood from the viewpoint of the individual.

We investigated the effects of continuation or discontinuation of donepezil and starting of memantine on subsequent nursing home placement in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.","In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Donepezil and Memantine in Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease (DOMINO-AD) trial, community-living patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (who had been prescribed donepezil continuously for at least 3 months at a dose of 10 mg for at least the previous 6 weeks and had a score of between 5 and 13 on the Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination) were recruited from 15 secondary care memory centres in England and Scotland and randomly allocated to continue donepezil 10 mg per day without memantine, discontinue donepezil without memantine, discontinue donepezil and start memantine 20 mg per day, or continue donepezil 10 mg per day and start memantine 20 mg per day, for 52 weeks. After 52 weeks, choice of treatment was left to participants and their physicians. Place of residence was recorded during the first 52 weeks of the trial and then every 26 weeks for a further 3 years. A secondary outcome of the trial, reported in this study, was nursing home placement: an irreversible move from independent accommodation to a residential caring facility. Analyses restricted to risk of placement in the first year of follow-up after the patients had completed the double-blind phase of the trial were post-hoc. The DOMINO-AD trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN49545035.","Between Feb 11, 2008, and March 5, 2010, 73 (25%) patients were randomly assigned to continue donepezil without memantine, 73 (25%) to discontinue donepezil without memantine, 76 (26%) to discontinue donepezil and start memantine, and 73 (25%) to continue donepezil and start memantine. 162 (55%) patients underwent nursing home placement within 4 years of randomisation, with similar numbers for all groups (36 [49%] in patients who continued donepezil without memantine, 42 [58%] who discontinued donepezil without memantine, 41 [54%] who discontinued donepezil and started memantine, and 43 [59%] who continued donepezil and started memantine). We noted significant (p=0\u00b7010) heterogeneity of treatment effect over time, with significantly more nursing home placements in the combined donepezil discontinuation groups during the first year (hazard ratio 2\u00b709 [95% CI 1\u00b729-3\u00b739]) than in the combined donepezil continuation groups, and no difference during the next 3 years (0\u00b789 [0\u00b758-1\u00b735]). We noted no effect of patients starting memantine compared with not starting memantine during the first year (0\u00b792 [0\u00b758-1\u00b745]) or the next 3 years (1\u00b723 [0\u00b781-1\u00b787]).","Withdrawal of donepezil in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease increased the risk of nursing home placement during 12 months of treatment, but made no difference during the following 3 years of follow-up. Decisions to stop or continue donepezil treatment should be informed by potential risks of withdrawal, even if the perceived benefits of continued treatment are not clear.","Medical Research Council and UK Alzheimer's Society."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

generation. In societal approaches to the mitigation of major disease 'burden', population screening can sometimes provide an effective approach to improving detection of disease and outcomes. However the acceptability of a systematic population screening programme for dementia, to the British public, is not known.","A Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) event was organised to give members of the public from the East of England an opportunity to offer their perspectives and to comment on the findings of a systematic literature review looking at attitudes and preferences towards screening for dementia. The event was attended by 36 members of the public and eight national Alzheimer's Society Research Network volunteers. The morning discussion contained a presentation, which defined population screening for attendees but contained no reference to the findings of the review. In the afternoon, findings of the review were presented and a discussion on the results was facilitated. The discussions were recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. The NVivo qualitative data software was used to facilitate this process.","A total of 23 key themes emerged in relation to the carer and general population. The most frequent themes which emerged were the low levels of understanding and awareness around the dementia syndrome; the acceptability and validity of any tests; costs to the National Health Service (NHS); an individual's existing health status existing health status; financial\/profit motive for screening; the inability to change prognosis; and the importance and availability of support.","Factors such as personal beliefs, experiences and attitudes to health impact on decisions to be screened for dementia. A number of additional concerns were raised which were not previously identified in the systematic literature review. These were around the economic incentives for screening (profit motive), the provision of social support, and the economic\/social impacts of screening programmes. This may reflect cultural differences in health and social care funding models between Britain and other countries where previous research was conducted."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Martin","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sm987@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fleming","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. jane.fleming@phpc.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cullum","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Academic Unit of Psychiatry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. sarah.cullum@nhs.net."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. tom.dening@nottingham.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School, UCL, London, UK. g.rait@ucl.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fox","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwich, UK Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.

It describes how to proceed after a diagnosis of dementia has been made in the early stages of the condition, and general measures to maintain physical and mental health. Drug therapy for cognitive dysfunction is explained in the context of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, and strategies for managing depression and psychotic symptoms are outlined. Non-pharmacological approaches are often effective. For behavioural problems such as agitation and aggression, it is important to try to understand any underlying factors. In general, the most important strategy is to avoid excessive prescribing.

Dementia should be distinguished from mild cognitive impairment, in which any cognitive and functional changes are less marked. Diagnosis of dementia is essentially clinical but investigations are helpful in excluding other disorders and in determining the underlying cause of the condition. International diagnostic criteria exist for the most common causes of dementia and these are useful for clinical and research purposes.

Yet the potential benefits, harms or acceptability of such a large-scale intervention are not well understood. This research aims to examine the attitudes and preferences of the general public, health care professionals, people with dementia and their carers towards population screening for dementia.","A systematic review of the international literature was undertaken. A search of fifteen bibliographic databases was conducted (up to 12 July 2012; no language restriction) using terms related to dementia, screening, specific screening tools, case finding, and attitudes and preferences; genetic screening and biomarkers were excluded. All study designs were included except opinion-based papers. Included papers were doubly quality assessed and thematically analysed using NVivo.","29,910 papers were identified of which 29 met the inclusion criteria. We identified seventeen themes relating to the 3 phases of the screening process (pre-, in- and post-screen) - none emerged as more of a facilitator than a barrier to the acceptance of dementia screening. Seven themes emerged in relation to the patient, carer and general population: existing health state; lifestyle and life view; awareness of dementia; role of clinician; communication; benefit; and role of the family. Ten themes emerged in relation to the clinician and healthcare professional: patient's existing health and comorbidities; awareness of dementia; confidence; duration of patient contact; suitability of screening tool; cost; disclosure; time; treatment and prognosis; and stigma.","As for all screening programmes, screening for dementia raises complex issues around preference and choice for clinicians and the public, and it is unclear what specific factors promote or reduce screening acceptance the most. Overall, the level of evidence is low, few large scale studies have been undertaken and none were conducted in representative samples, all affecting the generalizability of identified themes across healthcare contexts. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that population screening for dementia may not be acceptable to either the general public or health care professionals, and highlight where focused efforts are needed to gain insights into dementia specific issues."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Martin","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sm987@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelly","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sak65@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Khan","ForeName":"Ayesha","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. ak739@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cullum","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Academic Unit of Psychiatry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. sarah.cullum@nhs.net."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.

Here, we describe the groups of BPSD that have been identified in the literature and how they have been used to study associations, burden, treatment and underlying biology.","The literature database PubMed was searched for articles that identified clusters or factors of BPSD or used previously defined symptom groups.","Sixty-two studies were included. Generally, the following symptom groups were suggested: affective symptoms, including depression and anxiety; psychosis, including delusions and hallucinations; hyperactivity, including irritability and aggression; and euphoria. Symptoms that did not show consistent results include apathy, eating disturbances, night-time behaviour disturbances, disinhibition and aberrant motor behaviour. Symptom groups differed in their associations, treatment and biology.","Studies investigating symptom groups show relatively consistent results. Studying symptom groups allows similar symptoms to be studied together, which might strengthen results and may point to differences in their aetiology and treatment. However, a large amount of the individual variability of the symptoms could not be explained by the factors, and authors should carefully address their research question and hypotheses to decide if symptoms should be studied in groups or individually. Clinicians need to consider each symptom in its own right and also to be aware of the interrelations between them when assessing patients and developing strategies for treatment."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2013 The Authors.

A list of BPSD instruments was generated. For each instrument Pubmed and SCOPUS were searched for articles that reported on their use or quality. Eighty-three instruments that are used to measure BPSD were identified. Instruments differ in length and detail, whether the interview is with participants, informants or by observation, the target sample and the time frames for use. Reliability and validity is generally good, but reported in few independent samples. When choosing a BPSD instrument for research the research question should be carefully scrutinised and the symptoms of interest, population, quality, detail, time frame and practical issues should be considered.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der

treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not known whether treatment benefits continue after the progression to moderate-to-severe disease.","We assigned 295 community-dwelling patients who had been treated with donepezil for at least 3 months and who had moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (a score of 5 to 13 on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE, on which scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function]) to continue donepezil, discontinue donepezil, discontinue donepezil and start memantine, or continue donepezil and start memantine. Patients received the study treatment for 52 weeks. The coprimary outcomes were scores on the SMMSE and on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS, on which scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). The minimum clinically important differences were 1.4 points on the SMMSE and 3.5 points on the BADLS.","Patients assigned to continue donepezil, as compared with those assigned to discontinue donepezil, had a score on the SMMSE that was higher by an average of 1.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.5) and a score on the BADLS that was lower (indicating less impairment) by 3.0 points (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.3) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Patients assigned to receive memantine, as compared with those assigned to receive memantine placebo, had a score on the SMMSE that was an average of 1.2 points higher (95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P<0.001) and a score on the BADLS that was 1.5 points lower (95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8; P=0.02). The efficacy of donepezil and of memantine did not differ significantly in the presence or absence of the other. There were no significant benefits of the combination of donepezil and memantine over donepezil alone.","In patients with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, continued treatment with donepezil was associated with cognitive benefits that exceeded the minimum clinically important difference and with significant functional benefits over the course of 12 months.

dementia are not fully understood. Population-based longitudinal studies offer an opportunity to step back and examine which pathological indices best link to clinical state. CC75C is a longitudinal study of the population aged 75 and over at baseline in Cambridge, UK. We report on the first 213 participants coming to autopsy with sufficient information for an end of life dementia diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis was ascertained by examining retrospective informant interviews, survey responses, and death certificates according to DSM-IV criteria. The neuropathological protocol was based on the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD). Clinical dementia was present in 113 participants (53%): 67% with Alzheimer's disease, 4% vascular dementia, 22% mixed dementia, and 1% dementia with Lewy bodies. As Alzheimer-type pathology was common, the mutually blinded clinical and neuropathological diagnoses were not strongly related. Multivariable analysis identified associations between dementia during life and entorhinal cortex neuritic plaques, hippocampal diffuse plaques, neocortical neurofibrillary tangles, white matter pallor, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal atrophy. These results were consistent in those with clinical Alzheimer's disease. Vascular pathologies, especially microinfarcts, were more common in those with clinical diagnoses including vascular dementia. Alzheimer-type and cerebrovascular pathology are both common in the very old. A greater burden of these pathologies, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal atrophy, are associated with a higher risk of, but do not define, clinical dementia in old age."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Institute of Public Health, Robinson Way, Cambridge, CB2 0SR, UK. carol.brayne@medschl.cam.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Richardson","ForeName":"Kathryn","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Matthews","ForeName":"Fiona E","Initials":"FE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fleming","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hunter","ForeName":"Sally","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Xuereb","ForeName":"John H","Initials":"JH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Paykel","ForeName":"Eugene","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mukaetova-Ladinska","ForeName":"Elizabeta B","Initials":"EB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Huppert","ForeName":"Felicia A","Initials":"FA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Sullivan","ForeName":"Angela","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"Cambridge City Over-75s Cohort Cc75c Study Neuropathology Collaboration"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MC_U105292687","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["epidemiology","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Catchment Area, Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Cohort Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["epidemiology","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Population Surveillance","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Tissue Donors"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom","QualifierName":"epidemiology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"8","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"8","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"7","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19661624","W6110250388G4562","10.3233\/JAD-2009-1182"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19630974","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"09","Day":"18"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"08"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Jul","Day":"24"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"DOMINO-AD protocol: donepezil and memantine in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease - a multicentre RCT.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"57"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1745-6215-10-57","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, are the drug class with the best evidence of efficacy, licensed for mild to moderate AD, while the glutamate antagonist memantine has been widely prescribed, often in the later stages of AD. Memantine is licensed for moderate to severe dementia in AD but is not recommended by the England and Wales National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. However, there is little evidence to guide clinicians as to what to prescribe as AD advances; in particular, what to do as the condition progresses from moderate to severe. Options include continuing cholinesterase inhibitors irrespective of decline, adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, or prescribing memantine instead of cholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this trial is to establish the most effective drug option for people with AD who are progressing from moderate to severe dementia despite treatment with donepezil.","DOMINO-AD is a pragmatic, 15 centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Patients with AD, currently living at home, receiving donepezil 10 mg daily, and with Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) scores between 5 and 13 are being recruited. Each is randomized to one of four treatment options: continuation of donepezil with memantine placebo added; switch to memantine with donepezil placebo added; donepezil and memantine together; or donepezil placebo with memantine placebo. 800 participants are being recruited and treatment continues for one year. Primary outcome measures are cognition (SMMSE) and activities of daily living (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale). Secondary outcomes are non-cognitive dementia symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), health related quality of life (EQ-5D and DEMQOL-proxy), carer burden (General Health Questionnaire-12), cost effectiveness (using Client Service Receipt Inventory) and institutionalization. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, 6, 18, 30 and 52 weeks. All participants will be subsequently followed for 3 years by telephone interview to record institutionalization.","There is considerable debate about the clinical and cost effectiveness of anti-dementia drugs. DOMINO-AD seeks to provide clear evidence on the best treatment strategies for those managing patients at a particularly important clinical transition point.","Current controlled trials

Many of the individual trials of antidepressants have been too small to provide precise estimates of the moderate benefits that might realistically be expected. Combining the information from all appropriate trials may provide a better estimate of the likely effects of treatment.Objectives To determine whether antidepressants are clinically effective and acceptable for the treatment of patients with depression and also dementia.Search methods The CDCIG Specialized Register was last searched on 27 April 2005. This register contains records from major health care databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly.Medical information departments of pharmaceutical companies were asked to search their databases for any relevant clinical trials. Where necessary authors of trials were approached with requests for additional information.Selection criteria All relevant unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials comparing any antidepressant drug with placebo, for patients diagnosed as having dementia and depression, according to established criteria.Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted data independently and settled any differences by agreement.Main results There were seven included studies with a total of 1140 subjects of which 769 met inclusion criteria. Four included studies reported sufficiently detailed results to enter into meta-analyses, with a total of 137 subjects. Two of these studies investigated the properties of drugs not commonly used in this population with only two studies (Petracca 2001 and Lyketsos 2003) using the more common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Lyketsos 2003 produced two significant differences in favour of treatment in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) at 12 weeks and in the psychiatrists' global rating. However, the CSDD was not used in any of the other studies and no statistical differences were found with the other measures used in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of the number of patients suffering at least one adverse event, one event of the nervous system, one event of the gastrointestinal system and one event of dry mouth at 6 to 12 weeks showed a significant difference in favour of placebo. There were no other significant results.Authors' conclusions Available evidence offers weak support to the contention that antidepressants are effective for patients with depression and dementia.However, only four studies are included in the meta-analysis relating to efficacy, and sample sizes are small.Moreover, only two included studies investigated the properties of the more commonly used SSRIs and no studies investigated the properties of newer classes of antidepressants (e.g. selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors). This review draws attention to the paucity of research and evidence in this area."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bains","ForeName":"Jatinder","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, Manly Hospital (North Sydney Area Health), East Wing, Manly Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2095. jbains@med.usyd.edu.au"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Birks","ForeName":"Jacqueline","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2002","Month":"10","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","NlmUniqueID":"100909747","ISSNLinking":"1361-6137"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antidepressive Agents"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"UpdateIn"},"RefSource":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018 Aug 31;8:CD003944","PMID":"30168578"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Antidepressive Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"73"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"1","Day":"10","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"2","Day":"22","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"1","Day":"10","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12519625","10.1002\/14651858.CD003944"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12242190","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2002","Month":"10","Day":"07"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1756-1833","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"325","Issue":"7365","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Sep","Day":"21"}},"Title":"BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ"},"ArticleTitle":"Long term care for older people.

Within institutions, dementia prevalence was 62% (52-71), and was slightly higher in women than in men, with no increase by age. That most residents have dementia has implications for the type of care that institutions provide."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Matthews","ForeName":"Fiona E","Initials":"FE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, Institute of Public Health, University Forvie Site, Cambridge CB2 2SR, UK.

Although there is still no preventative treatment or cure for this neurodegenerative illness, the development of drugs that may alleviate some of the cognitive symptoms associated with it is advancing. Cholinesterase inhibitors are at present the most effective form of treatment and have shown significant overall response rates in clinical trials. However, although some patients show substantial improvement when treated with this class of drugs, there is considerable variability in the amount of benefit gained in different individuals in terms of their cognitive and behavioural functioning. Furthermore, unfortunately some patients gain little or no benefit from these drugs. It would therefore be of great advantage to explore alternative therapeutic possibilities. This article reviews the potential involvement of the nicotinic cholinergic system in Alzheimer's disease and discusses the possibility of nicotinic pharmacotherapy. Substantial evidence indicates the involvement of the nicotinic cholinergic system in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Drugs targeting these sites may not only have a positive effect on cognitive function, but also have additional therapeutic benefits in terms of restoring the hypoactivity in the excitatory amino acid pyramidal system and even slowing the emergence of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The conclusion of this review is that nicotinic treatments are an important potential source of new therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vesey","ForeName":"Robyn","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of
