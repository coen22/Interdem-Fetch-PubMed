However, evidence of established oxidative stress in AD peripheral cells is still inconclusive, possibly due to both, differences in the type of samples and the heterogeneity of oxidative markers used in different studies.","The aim of this study was to evaluate blood-based redox alterations in Alzheimer's Disease in order to identify a peculiar disease profile.","To that purpose, we measured the activity of Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase both in the extracellular and the intracellular blood compartments of AD, MCI and control subjects. The amount of an open isoform of p53 protein (unfolded p53), resulting from oxidative modifications was also determined.","Decreased SOD, increased GPx activity and higher p53 open isoform were found in both AD and MCI plasma compared to controls. In blood peripheral mononuclear cells, SOD activity was also decreased in both AD and MCI, and unfolded p53 increased exquisitely in younger AD males compared to controls.","Overall, these data

familial early-onset Alzhe\u00edmer's disease (AD). DNA variants at several genes have been linked to the risk of developing the most common late-onset form of AD (LOAD). A few studies analyzed the contribution of APP variants to LOAD, with negative or conflicting results. We determined the variation in the 18 APP exons and flanking intronic sequences in a total of 350 LOAD patients from Spain. A total of 13 nucleotide changes were found and 6 were new and not found among 340 healthy controls, including the only missense change (D243N). The in silico analysis suggested that none of them would have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing or protein folding (D243N). Patients and controls were also genotyped for three APP promoter polymorphisms, and none of them was significantly associated with LOAD. We concluded that APP variants would not contribute to the risk of developing LOAD in our

Among the several candidate genes are those that encode proteins involved in neuronal degeneration\/survival. Studies of primary neuronal cultures supported that members of the myocyte enhancing factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors have an anti-apoptotic effect, regulating the expression of proteins involved in neuronal survival and differentiation. We analysed the MEF2A gene in a total of 357 patients (mean age 72 years, range 60-97 years). Among others, a Pro279Leu in exon 8 and a polyglutamine (CAG) repeat polymorphisms in exon 12 were found. These variants were also genotyped in 495 healthy controls (>50 years old), and the frequencies were statistically compared. Eight patients were 279L (six P\/L and two L\/L), compared to only one control (2% vs. 0.2%; p=0.004, OR=11.32). There was a significantly higher frequency of 279L-carriers among APOE epsilon4+ (7\/154=4.5%), compared to epsilon4- (1\/203) (p=0.02). In conclusion, our work suggests that the variation at the MEF2A gene could be involved in the risk of developing LOAD. Because MEF2 has been related with neuronal survival, and the 279L allele has been related with a reduction in the transcriptional activation activity of MEF2A, the effect of this allele could be mediated through a down-regulation of antiapoptotic genes."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gonz\u00e1lez","ForeName":"Pelayo","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Gen\u00e9tica Molecular-Instituto de Estudios Nefrol\u00f3gicos, Hospital Universitario Central Asturias, Oviedo, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alvarez","ForeName":"Victoria","Initials":"V"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Men\u00e9ndez","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lahoz","ForeName":"Carlos H","Initials":"CH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mart\u00ednez","ForeName":"Carmen","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corao","ForeName":"Ana I","Initials":"AI"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Calatayud","ForeName":"Mar\u00eda T","Initials":"MT"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pe\u00f1a","ForeName":"Joaqu\u00edn","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Garc\u00eda-Castro","ForeName":"M\u00f3nica","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coto","ForeName":"Eliecer","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Ireland","MedlineTA":"Neurosci Lett","NlmUniqueID":"7600130","ISSNLinking":"0304-3940"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Apolipoprotein E4"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"MADS Domain Proteins"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"MEF2 Transcription Factors"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"MEF2A protein, human"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Myogenic Regulatory Factors"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Peptides"},{"RegistryNumber":"26700-71-0","NameOfSubstance":"polyglutamine"},{"RegistryNumber":"9DLQ4CIU6V","NameOfSubstance":"Proline"},{"RegistryNumber":"GMW67QNF9C","NameOfSubstance":"Leucine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Apolipoprotein E4","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"DNA Mutational Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Exons"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Gene Frequency"},{"DescriptorName":"Genetic Predisposition to Disease"},{"DescriptorName":"Genotype"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Leucine","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"MADS Domain Proteins","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"MEF2 Transcription Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Myogenic Regulatory Factors","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Odds Ratio"},{"DescriptorName":"Peptides","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Polymorphism, Genetic"},{"DescriptorName":"Proline","QualifierName":"genetics"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2006","Month":"05","Day":"16"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2006","Month":"09","Day":"13"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2006","Month":"09","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"23","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"1","Day":"27","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"23","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17112666","S0304-3940(06)00989-X","10.1016\/j.neulet.2006.09.055"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15862185","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"06","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0387-7604","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Brain & development","ISOAbbreviation":"Brain Dev"},"ArticleTitle":"Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and seizures.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"246-52"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Neuropathologically, Alzheimer-type abnormalities are demonstrated in patients with Down syndrome (DS), both demented and nondemented and more than a half of patients with DS above 50 years develop Alzheimer's disease (AD).
