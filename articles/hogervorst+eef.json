The aim of the Promoting Independence in Dementia (PRIDE) study was to develop a postdiagnostic social intervention to help people live as well and as independently as possible. The intervention facilitates engagement in evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical and social activities.","Theories to promote adjustment to a dementia diagnosis, including theories of social learning and self-efficacy, were reviewed alongside self-management and the selective optimization model, to form the basis of the intervention. Analyses of two longitudinal databases of older adults, and qualitative analyses of interviews of older people, people with dementia, and their carers about their experiences of dementia, informed the content and focus of the intervention. Consensus expert review involving stakeholders was conducted to synthesize key components. Participants were sourced from the British NHS, voluntary services, and patient and public involvement groups. A tailored manual-based intervention was developed with the aim for this to be delivered by an intervention provider.","Evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical, and social activities that have been shown to benefit people were key components of the proposed PRIDE intervention. Thirty-two participants including people with dementia (n=4), carers (n=11), dementia advisers (n=14), and older people (n=3) provided feedback on the drafts of the intervention and manual. Seven topics for activities were included (eg, \"making decisions\" and \"getting your message across\"). The manual outlines delivery of the intervention over three sessions where personalized profiles and plans for up to three activities are developed, implemented, and reviewed.","A manualized intervention was constructed based on robust methodology and found to be acceptable to participants. Consultations with stakeholders played a key role in shaping the manualized PRIDE intervention and its delivery. Unlike most social interventions for dementia, the target audience for our intervention is the people with dementia themselves."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 Yates et

Data suggested that effects of folic acid based interventions may only be shown before cognitive decline is evident and\/or if people are folate deficient. In older people in Indonesia, Hawai'i and China, tofu, which can contain high levels of phytoestrogens, was found to increase dementia risk. This association was not mediated by a vegetarian diet, socioeconomic status, formaldehyde, thyroid function, or loss of teeth. On the other hand, human observational and animal treatment studies suggested that tempe, a fermented soya product containing phytoestrogens and folate, reduced dementia risk and improved memory. High oestrogen levels were found to increase dementia risk in older women. However, in women with adequate serum folate, high oestrogen levels did not confer additional dementia risk and may protect ageing neurons. In conclusion, reviews seem to suggest that folic acid interventions are only effective on cognitive outcomes in people who are folate deficient and do not have cognitive impairment. Frequent consumption of tofu may have detrimental effects on memory and increase dementia risk in older East Asian people, while tempe may reduce these risks.

To gain insight in how memory is affected in dementia, and to further improve the efficacy of the HVLT, in-depth analysis of the recall patterns of dementia cases and controls was conducted. Dementia cases and controls were matched for factors that can affect performance, such as age, gender and education level. Word frequency, syllable length, and orthographic neighbourhood size did not differ in the Indonesian version of the HVLT, nor did these characteristics affect recall. However dementia cases showed consistent and poor recall across the three trials; with the worst recall for the \"human shelter\" category and best recall for the \"animals\" category. Dementia cases also showed impaired accessibility of all categories with reduced subsequent recall from accessed categories and reduced primacy and recency levels. Finally, dementia cases exhibited lower levels of re-remembering and recalling new words, and higher levels of immediate forgetting and never recalling words. It was concluded that utilising the extra information provided by the in-depth analyses of the recall patterns could be beneficial to improve dementia screening."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grenfell-Essam","ForeName":"Rachel","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences , Loughborough University , Loughborough , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hogervorst","ForeName":"Eef","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences , Loughborough University , Loughborough , UK."},{"Affiliation":"b Centre for Ageing Studies , Universitas Indonesia , Depok , Indonesia."},{"Affiliation":"c Faculty of Health Sciences , Universitas Respati Indonesia , Jakarta Timur , Indonesia."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"W Rahardjo","ForeName":"Tri Budi","Initials":"TB","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences , Loughborough University , Loughborough , UK."},{"Affiliation":"b Centre for Ageing Studies , Universitas Indonesia , Depok , Indonesia."},{"Affiliation":"c Faculty of Health Sciences , Universitas Respati Indonesia , Jakarta Timur , Indonesia."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Memory","NlmUniqueID":"9306862","ISSNLinking":"0965-8211"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Recall","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Verbal Learning","QualifierName":"physiology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","HVLT","Hopkins Verbal Learning Test","memory","recall patterns"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"3","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28693360","10.1080\/09658211.2017.1349804"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28658937","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1758-5368","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"75","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2020","Month":"01","Day":"01"}},"Title":"The journals of gerontology.

Prospective Cohort Studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"4945-4954"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Although both overt hyper- and hypothyroidism are known to lead to cognitive impairment, data on the association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cognitive function are conflicting.","This study sought to determine the risk of dementia and cognitive decline associated with subclinical thyroid dysfunction among prospective cohorts.","We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception until November 2014.","Two physicians identified prospective cohorts that assessed thyroid function and cognitive outcomes (dementia; Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]).","Data were extracted by one reviewer following standardized protocols and verified by a second reviewer. The primary outcome was dementia and decline in cognitive function was the secondary outcome.","Eleven prospective cohorts followed 16,805 participants during a median followup of 44.4 months. Five studies analyzed the risk of dementia in subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) (n = 6410), six in subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) (n = 7401). Five studies analyzed MMSE decline in SHyper (n = 7895), seven in SHypo (n = 8960). In random-effects models, the pooled adjusted risk ratio for dementia in SHyper was 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.04; 2.69) and 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.84; 1.55) in SHypo vs euthyroidism, both without evidence of significant heterogeneity (I = 0.0%). The pooled mean MMSE decline from baseline to followup (mean 32 mo) did not significantly differ between SHyper or SHypo vs euthyroidism.","SHyper might be associated with an elevated risk for dementia, whereas SHypo is not, and both conditions are not associated with faster decline in MMSE over time. Available data are limited, and additional large, high-quality studies are needed."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rieben","ForeName":"Carole","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Internal Medicine (C.R., D.S., C.E.A., C.B., D.A., N.R.), Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, 3010 Bern, Switzerland; Institute of Primary Health Care (BIHAM), Faculty of Medicine (B.R.d.C., N.R.), University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland; Service of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism (T.-H.C.), University Hospital of Lausanne, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories (T.-H.C.), Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, United Kingdom; Department of Epidemiology (L.C., R.P.P.), Rotterdam Thyroid Center, 3015 GE Rotterdam, The Netherlands; School of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences (O.P.A.), University of Western Australia, Perth 6009, Australia; School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences (E.H.), Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU, United Kingdom; Department of Cardiology (S.T.), Leiden University Medical Center, 2333 ZA Leiden, The Netherlands; Kuakini Medical Center and the Department of Geriatric Medicine (K.M.), John A.

Indonesia. Several studies found negative associations of high tofu consumption with cognitive function in older Asian populations. However, the effect of tofu on cognitive function remains disputed as it was not found in Western populations. In the present study, the effect of weekly tofu intake on cognitive performance was investigated in an observational cross sectional study of 517 Chinese elderly from Shanghai. Similar to earlier studies, results showed that a higher weekly intake of tofu was associated with worse memory performance using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (\u03b2 = -0.10, p = 0.01) after controlling for age, gender, education, being vegetarian, and weekly intake of fruit\/juice, green vegetables, and orange\/red vegetables. Furthermore, among older elderly (\u226568 years of age), high tofu intake increased the risk of cognitive impairment indicative of dementia (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 0.99-1.64, p = 0.04), after adjusting for all covariates. Consumption of meat and green vegetables independently also reduced risk of dementia. To conclude, high intake of tofu was negatively related to cognitive performance among community-dwelling elderly in China. Similar findings were reported in Indonesia and in Japanese Americans in the US. These findings suggest that the effect of tofu on cognition in elderly should be further investigated.

of phytoestrogen compounds (found in soy) have been demonstrated in animal research and cell culture studies. In particular, phytoestrogens have been shown to reduce Alzheimer's Disease (AD) related pathology, potentially alleviating risk of AD progression. In addition to their antioxidant properties, soy products also have the ability to affect cognition via interaction with estrogen receptors. However, observational studies and randomised controlled trials in humans have resulted in inconclusive findings within this domain. There are several possible reasons for these discrepant data. Studies which report no effect of phytoestrogens on cognition have mainly been carried out in European cohorts, with an average low dietary consumption. In contrast, investigation of Asian populations, with a higher general intake of tofu (a non-fermented soy product) have shown negative associations with cognitive function in those over the age of 65. Consideration of type of soy product is important, as in the latter sample, protective effects of tempe (fermented soy) were also observed. Limited data provide evidence that effects of phytoestrogens on cognition may be modified by dosage, duration of consumption and cognitive test used. Additionally, characteristics of the study population including age, gender, ethnicity and menopausal status appear to be mediating variables. Phytoestrogen treatment interventions have also shown time-limited positive effects on cognition. These findings are consistent with estrogen treatment studies, where initial positive short-term cognitive effects may occur, which reverse with long-term continuous use in elderly women. Well controlled, large scale studies are needed to assess the effects of phytoestrogens on the aging brain and provide further understanding of this association.

Some studies also found an increased risk of dementia with high tofu consumption in those older than 65years of age. Tofu and other soy products, such as tempeh, contain high levels of plant estrogens or isoflavones. This study revisited a rural Central Javanese population (56-97 years of age) who were covered by the Borobudur District Health Centers. Data on cognitive performance were available for n=142 participants. Results showed positive linear associations of weekly tofu (beta=.22, p<0.05) and tempeh (beta=.23, p<0.01) consumption with immediate recall, which were significant in those with an average age of 67 years. In those with an average age of 80 years, the earlier reported negative association of tofu with immediate recall was no longer significant. Lifestyle changes (reduction of tofu consumption after dissemination of results) or \"healthy survivor effects\" may have been responsible for this finding. These findings may be reminiscent of the \"Window of Opportunity\" theory, which suggests that estrogenic compounds can exert positive effects on verbal memory, but not in older men and women, when no or negative effects of these compounds on brain cells and cognition have been found. Long-term, placebo-controlled treatment studies should investigate whether tempeh, a fermented soybean product that also contains folate, can maintain cognitive function in middle-aged and elderly participants.","CopyrightInformation":"Crown Copyright \u00a9 2010.

This debate is based on many animal and cell culture data showing that estrogens can positively affect the aging brain. Observational data also show a halved risk of dementia in women who took estrogens around the age of menopause. However, large treatment trials have shown negative effects of long-term treatment with estrogens in older women. The present meta-analyses included 36 randomised treatment trials and tested various hypotheses which have been developed to attempt to explain discrepant data. Results indicated that, contrary to expectations, age of women and duration of time elapsed when treatment was initiated since menopause ('window of opportunity' hypothesis) did not significantly affect treatment outcome, nor did it matter whether women were symptomatic or not. It was not clear whether bilateral oophorectomy affected the outcome, as this effect was based on only a few studies from the same group and some observational studies show negative effects on cognition in surgical menopausal women treated with hormones for more than 10 years. Duration of treatment overall significantly affected outcome. More negative effects were seen in longer studies, where positive effects were mainly seen in short term studies (<4 months). Treatment with combined estrogens and progestagens also negatively affected the outcome. Whether women with symptoms should be treated for a couple of months or using other (intermittent) modes of treatment and whether this could have long-term positive consequences remains to be investigated.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of visual interventions to improve the functioning of AD patients. Therefore, clarification of the profile of visual deficits in AD and possible mechanisms underlying these deficits are needed. This review focuses on three areas as mechanisms for the visual impairment in AD: 1) the broad-band pathway deficit; 2) glaucoma; and 3) the relative dysfunction of the ventral and dorsal streams of vision. While much research has been produced with regard to these areas, methodological flaws and lack of continuity between studies has led to conflicting findings. Nevertheless, recent imaging research suggests that the loss of retinal ganglion cells in AD may play an important role in the visual deficit in AD.
