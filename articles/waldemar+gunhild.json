However, these studies did not differentiate between migraine types and did not investigate all prevalent dementia subtypes. The main objective of this national register-based study was to investigate whether migraine was a risk factor for dementia. Additionally, we explored potential differences in dementia risk for migraine with and without aura.","We obtained data on birth cohorts born between 1935 and 1956 (n\u2009=\u20091,657,890) from Danish national registers. Individuals registered with migraine before age 59 (n\u2009=\u200918,135) were matched (1:5) on sex and birthdate with individuals without migraine (n\u2009=\u20091,378,346). Migraine was defined by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses and dementia was defined by ICD diagnoses and anti-dementia medication. After matching, 62,578 individuals were eligible for analysis. For the statistical analyses, we used Cox regression models and adjusted for socio-demographic factors and several psychiatric and somatic morbidities.","During a median follow-up time of 6.9 (IQR: 3.6-11.2) years, 207 individuals with migraine developed dementia. Compared with individuals without migraine, we found a 50% higher rate of dementia among individuals with migraine (HR\u2009=\u20091.50; 95% CI: 1.28-1.76). Individuals without aura had a 19% higher rate of dementia (HR\u2009=\u20091.19; 95% CI: 0.84-1.70), and individuals with aura had a two times higher rate of dementia (HR\u2009=\u20092.11; 95% CI: 1.48-3.00).","Our findings support the hypothesis that migraine is a midlife risk factor for dementia in later life. The higher rate of dementia in individuals with a hospital-based diagnosis of migraine with aura emphasizes the need for studies on pathological mechanisms and potential preventative measures. Furthermore, given that only hospital-based migraine diagnoses were included in this study, future research should also investigate migraine cases derived from the primary healthcare system to include less severe migraine cases."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Islamoska","ForeName":"Sabrina","Initials":"S","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7693-6142","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

Antipsychotic Pharmacotherapy: A Nationwide Registry-Based Study.","ELocationID":["10.4088\/JCP.19m12828","19m12828"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Antipsychotic drugs are known to increase mortality among patients with dementia. Many patients receive concomitant treatment with other psychotropic agents. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the impact of benzodiazepines and antidepressants on the risk of death in patients with dementia initiating antipsychotic drug treatment.","Nationwide registry data on all incident dementia cases among individuals aged 65 years and older in Denmark between 2009 and 2013 for which antipsychotic treatment was initiated were used. The 180-day mortality was evaluated by crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs, including adjustment for somatic and psychiatric comorbidity, other prescription drugs, nursing home residency, and time since diagnosis), comparing periods of antipsychotic treatment with periods of concomitant treatment with benzodiazepines or antidepressants.","Among 41,494 incident dementia cases, antipsychotic treatment was initiated for 10,291 (24.8%). After 3,140 people were excluded due to recent antipsychotic drug use or hospitalization, 7,151 people were included in the analysis. The total follow-up time during current antipsychotic treatment was 1,146 person-years, and 831 died during antipsychotic treatment. Compared with antipsychotic treatment alone, the risk of death increased during antipsychotic treatment in combination with benzodiazepines (adjusted HR = 2.19; 95% CI, 1.83-2.63), while there was a decreased risk of death during antipsychotic treatment in combination with antidepressants (adjusted HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50-0.74).","The diverse impact of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants on mortality may be due to a direct drug-related effect. Alternatively, the findings could reflect differential mortality associated with different indications for therapy. Although the results cannot prove causality, and there may be residual confounding, clinicians should be cautious when considering the combination of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines in patients with dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Copyright 2020 Physicians Postgraduate Press,

Data included place of residence, prescriptions, and discharge diagnoses from hospital contacts. Prevalence of opioid use among elderly with (n\u200a=\u200a36,014) and without dementia (n\u200a=\u200a1,011,787) was compared nationwide across the five Danish regions using logistic regression analysis and for the 98 municipalities using age and sex standardization.","32.5% of elderly with dementia and 16.9% without were treated with an opioid in 2015. For home-living elderly with dementia, there was a 4-fold difference in opioid use (9.4 to 36.8%) between municipalities compared to a 1.6-fold (12.7 to 20.2%) difference for elderly without. In nursing home residents there was a 2-fold difference (dementia: 26.5 to 55.2%; no dementia: 31.8 to 60.4%). Differences between the five regions were minor.","Opioid use in elderly with dementia was frequent and almost twice as high compared to elderly without dementia, which may challenge patient safety.

people living with dementia. However, a range of special and heterogeneous needs must be considered when designing and deploying AT for people with dementia, and consequently the involvement of end-users throughout the design process is essential to provide usable and effective AT solutions.","The ReACT study was conducted to investigate how a tailor-made app, the ReACT app, can be designed and deployed to meet the needs of people with dementia in relation to self-management.","This paper presents 4 steps of an iterative user-involving app design process. In the first step, a pilot study was conducted to explore the potential benefits and challenges of using existing off-the-shelf apps to support self-management when living with early-stage dementias. In the second step, focus group interviews provided in-depth understanding of the perspectives and needs of potential end-users of the app. The third step was a product benchmarking process, which served to further qualify the design process. Finally, results from these first 3 steps were included in the fourth step where the ReACT app was designed through an iterative codesign process. In total, 28 people with dementia, 17 family caregivers, and 10 professional caregivers were involved through these 4 iterative steps.","The functionalities and the design of the ReACT app directly reflect the perspectives and needs of end-users in relation to self-management. Support of memory and structure in daily living were identified as main needs, and the ReACT app was designed as a holistic and adaptable solution with a tailor-made calendar as a key feature.","Based on this extensive iterative user-involving design process, the ReACT app has great potential to support and enhance self-management of people living with dementia. Further studies are needed to test and validate the usability and impact of the app, and methods for deployment and adoption of AT for people with dementia also need to be considered."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).

Working hours covered <27, 28-36, 37 (reference), 38-44, and \u226545\u2009hours\/week. As the primary outcome, we used register-based information about dementia, and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CI. Estimates were adjusted for gender, age, psychosocial work factors and cardiovascular risk factors.","We identified 85 dementia cases during a mean of 9.8 years of follow-up. We found a positive, but statistically insignificant association between night shift work and dementia (IRR=2.01; 95% CI: 0.87-4.65). Post hoc analyses indicated that this was only due to a higher risk in permanent night workers (IRR=3.25; 95% CI: 1.35-7.83). The dementia risk was also significantly higher among participants working 38-44\u2009hours\/week (IRR=2.08; 95% CI: 1.11-3.90) compared with those working 37\u2009hours\/week.

complaints or impairment will progress or remain stable. We assessed the impact of using a clinical decision support system, the PredictND tool, to predict progression in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in memory clinics.","In this prospective multicenter study, we included 429 patients with SCD (n\u2009=\u2009230) and MCI (n\u2009=\u2009199) (female 54%, age 67\u2009\u00b1\u20099, MMSE 28\u2009\u00b1\u20092) and followed them for at least 12\u2009months. Based on all available patient baseline data (demographics, cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and MRI), the PredictND tool provides a comprehensive overview of the data and a classification defining the likelihood of progression. At baseline, a clinician defined an expected follow-up diagnosis and estimated the level of confidence in their prediction using a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100%), first without and subsequently with the PredictND tool. As outcome measure, we defined clinical progression as progression from SCD to MCI or dementia, and from MCI to dementia. Correspondence between the expected and the actual clinical progression at follow-up defined the prognostic accuracy.","After a mean follow-up time of 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009years, 21 (9%) SCD and 63 (32%) MCI had progressed. When using the PredictND tool, the overall prognostic accuracy was unaffected (0.4%, 95%CI -\u20093.0%; +\u20093.9%; p\u2009=\u20090.79). However, restricting the analysis to patients with more certain classifications (n\u2009=\u2009203), we found an increase of 3% in the accuracy (95%CI -\u20090.6%; +\u20096.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.11). Furthermore, for this subgroup, the tool alone showed a statistically significant increase in the prognostic accuracy compared to the evaluation without tool (6.4%, 95%CI 2.1%; 10.7%; p\u2009=\u20090.004). Specifically, the negative predictive value was high. Moreover, confidence in the prediction increased significantly (\u2206VAS\u2009=\u20094%, p\u2009<\u2009.0001).","Adding the PredictND tool to the clinical evaluation increased clinicians' confidence. Furthermore, the results indicate that the tool has the potential to improve prediction of progression for patients with more certain classifications."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bruun","ForeName":"Marie","Initials":"M","Identifier":"0000-0002-1066-1035","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish

Three MRI atrophy biomarkers were derived from the normalized volumes of automatically segmented cortical regions: 1) the anterior vs. posterior index, 2) the asymmetry index, and 3) the temporal pole left index. We used the following performance metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.

Information on time trends in polypharmacy in people with dementia is limited, although they may be more susceptible to risks associated with polypharmacy.","To examine changes in the prevalence of polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy in people with dementia compared to changes in people without dementia.","Repeated cross-sectional study of the entire Danish population aged\u226565 from 2000 (n\u200a=\u200a790,717) to 2014 (n\u200a=\u200a1,028,377) using linked register data on diagnoses, filled prescriptions, and demographic data. Multivariate analyses were performed to explore changes in the prevalence of polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy (\u22655 and\u226510 different prescription drugs). This was done before and after 2011 to examine whether increasing awareness of potential problems associated with polypharmacy has altered the trend. Estimates for people with and without dementia were compared.","In people with dementia, the prevalence of polypharmacy increased from 47.3% to 69.4% from 2000 to 2011 and excessive polypharmacy from 7.4% to 20.9%. In people without dementia, polypharmacy increased from 22.7% to 36.1% and excessive polypharmacy from 3.5% to 7.7%. The increase was significantly more marked in people with dementia across all age groups. From 2011 to 2014, the prevalence of polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy remained relatively stable: Polypharmacy decreased negligibly from 69.4% to 68.1% in people with dementia and from 36.1% to 35.2% in people without dementia.","Although the increasing trend has halted, polypharmacy remains widespread in people with dementia.

Computer- based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have the potential to provide an objective comparison of data and assist clinicians.","To assess the diagnostic impact of a CDSS, the PredictND tool, for differential diagnosis of dementia in memory clinics.","In this prospective multicenter study, we recruited 779 patients with either subjective cognitive decline (n=252), mild cognitive impairment (n=219) or any type of dementia (n=274) and followed them for minimum 12 months. Based on all available patient baseline data (demographics, neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and MRI visual and computed ratings), the PredictND tool provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of the data with a likelihood index for five diagnostic groups; Alzheimer\u00b4s disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and subjective cognitive decline. At baseline, a clinician defined an etiological diagnosis and confidence in the diagnosis, first without and subsequently with the PredictND tool. The follow-up diagnosis was used as the reference diagnosis.","In total, 747 patients completed the follow-up visits (53% female, 69\u00b110 years). The etiological diagnosis changed in 13% of all cases when using the PredictND tool, but the diagnostic accuracy did not change significantly. Confidence in the diagnosis, measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100%) increased (\u0394VAS=3.0%, p<0.0001), especially in correctly changed diagnoses (\u0394VAS=7.2%, p=0.0011).","Adding the

and cardiovascular mechanisms. Vital exhaustion (VE) is a mental state of psychological distress, which could be a risk factor for dementia.","To investigate whether VE is a risk factor for dementia in later life.","We used data from 6,807 participants attending the third survey of the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1991-1994. VE was assessed by 17 symptoms (score: 0-17) from the Maastricht Questionnaire. Information on dementia was obtained from national registers. Risk time for dementia was counted from five years after VE assessment for participants\u200a>\u200a55 years at the time of VE assessment. For younger participants, risk time for dementia was counted from the year they turned 60 years and onwards. Participants were followed until 2016. We used Poisson regression to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).","During an average follow-up of 10 years, 872 participants were registered with dementia. We found a dose-response relation between the number of VE symptoms and the incidence of dementia. For every additional VE symptom, the dementia incidence increased by 2% (IRR\u200a=\u200a1.024; 95% CI: 1.004-1.043). Adjustment for socio-demographic and health-related factors did not change the results substantially. Neither did stratification by age, sex, educational level, and marital status.","We found evidence that VE is a risk factor for dementia. Our sensitivity analyses supported that this association was not only due to VE being a potential prodromal sign of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Islamoska","ForeName":"Sabrina","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

negative aspects of social relations on cognitive function, and they have shown mixed results. Conflicts at work are part of the negative aspects of social relations, but the impact of experiencing conflicts at work has not yet been investigated as a risk factor for dementia. Therefore, we investigated whether experiencing prolonged or serious conflicts with a supervisor or colleagues at work was associated with incident dementia in old age.","We analyzed data of 6,436 men and women from the third survey of the Copenhagen City Heart Study. At baseline in 1991-1994, the participants reported whether they had ever had a prolonged or serious conflict at work. The participants were followed until 2014. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).","After adjusting for potential confounders, the IRR for dementia was 1.53 (95% CI 0.77-3.03) among participants who had reported having prolonged or serious conflicts both with a supervisor and colleagues compared with participants who had never had such conflicts. In separate analyses stratified by sex, the IRRs were 2.14 (95% Cl 0.97-4.71) for men and 0.98 (95% Cl 0.29-3.32) for women.","Our findings did not support an overall association between experiencing prolonged or serious conflicts at work and incident dementia.

been extensively investigated in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field, and are now being applied in clinical practice. CSF amyloid-beta (A\u03b21-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) reflect disease pathology, and may be used as quantitative traits for genetic analyses, fostering the identification of new genetic factors and the proposal of novel biological pathways of the disease. In patients, the concentration of CSF A\u03b21-42 is decreased due to the accumulation of A\u03b21-42 in amyloid plaques in the brain, while t-tau and p-tau levels are increased, indicating the extent of neuronal damage. To better understand the biological mechanisms underlying the regulation of AD biomarkers, and its relation to AD, we examined the association between 36 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and AD biomarkers A\u03b21-42, t-tau, and p-tau in CSF in a cohort of 672 samples (571 AD patients and 101 controls) collected within 10 European consortium centers.Our results highlighted five genes, APOE, LOC100129500, PVRL2, SNAR-I, and TOMM40, previously described as main players in the regulation of CSF biomarkers levels, further reinforcing a role for these in AD pathogenesis. Three new AD susceptibility loci, INPP5D, CD2AP, and CASS4, showed specific association with CSF tau biomarkers. The identification of genes that specifically influence tau biomarkers point out to mechanisms, independent of amyloid processing, but in turn related to tau biology that may open new venues to be explored for AD treatment."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ramos de Matos","ForeName":"Mafalda","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular Jo\u00e3o Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ferreira","ForeName":"Catarina","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular Jo\u00e3o Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Herukka","ForeName":"Sanna-Kaisa","Initials":"SK","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Clinical Medicine - Neurology, University of Eastern Finland, and Department of Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soininen","ForeName":"Hilkka","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Clinical Medicine - Neurology, University of Eastern Finland, and Department of Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Janeiro","ForeName":"Andr\u00e9","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Instituto de Medicina Molecular Jo\u00e3o Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Santana","ForeName":"Isabel","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neurochemistry Laboratory, CHUC - Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Neurogenetics Laboratory, CNC - Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology and CNC.IBILI, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baldeiras","ForeName":"In\u00eas","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neurochemistry Laboratory, CHUC - Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Neurogenetics Laboratory, CNC - Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology and CNC.IBILI, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Almeida","ForeName":"Maria Ros\u00e1rio","Initials":"MR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neurochemistry Laboratory, CHUC - Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Neurogenetics Laboratory, CNC - Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology and CNC.IBILI, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lle\u00f3","ForeName":"Alberto","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology and Sant Pau Biomedical Research Institute, Memory Unit, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, and Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, CIBERNED, Madrid, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dols-Icardo","ForeName":"Oriol","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology and Sant Pau Biomedical Research Institute, Memory Unit, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, and Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, CIBERNED, Madrid, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alcolea","ForeName":"Daniel","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology and Sant Pau Biomedical Research Institute, Memory Unit, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, and Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, CIBERNED, Madrid, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Benussi","ForeName":"Luisa","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Molecular Markers Laboratory, IRCCS Cento S.

Cross-Cultural Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB) for dementia in different ethnic populations in Western Europe, to examine its ability to differentiate cognitive impairment profiles for dementia subtypes, and to assess the impact of demographic variables on diagnostic properties.","The study was a Western European cross-sectional multi-center study. A total of 66 patients with dementia and 118 cognitively intact participants were included across six memory clinics; 93 had ethnic minority background and 91 had ethnic majority background. Tests in the CNTB cover global cognitive function, memory, language, executive functions, and visuospatial functions.","Significant differences with moderate to large effect sizes were present between patients with dementia and control participants on all CNTB measures. Area under the curves (AUC) ranged from .62 to .99 with a mean AUC across all measures of .83. Comparison of ethnic minority and majority groups generally revealed higher sensitivity in the minority group but no significant difference in the mean AUC's across all measures (.84 vs78, P\u00a0=\u00a0.42). Comparison of impairment profiles for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD dementia revealed that AD patients were significantly more impaired on the memory domain, whereas patients with non-AD dementia were more impaired on the executive functions domain.","The CNTB was found to have promising cross-cultural diagnostic properties for evaluation of dementia in the targeted minority

function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to modify disease processes and cognitive function.","The aim of this study was to investigate 1) the effect of moderate-high-intensity aerobic exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness, i.e., peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) determined by direct breath-by-breath cardiopulmonary exercise test, and 2) the association between changes in VO2peak and changes in cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with mild AD.","The study is based on secondary outcome analyses from the large single-blinded multi-center study ADEX (Preserving Cognition, Quality of Life, Physical Health and Functional Ability in Alzheimer's Disease: The Effect of Physical Exercise). A preselected sub-group of 55 participants (age 52-83 years), 29 from the intervention group (IG) and 26 from the control group (CG), was included. IG performed 16 weeks of supervised moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise. Assessments of VO2peak, mental speed and attention (Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) were performed at baseline and at 16 weeks.","VO2peak increased 13% in the IG and a between-group difference in mean change (3.92 ml\/kg\/min, 95% CI 6.34-1.51, p = 0.003) was present in favor of the IG. Combined data from IG and CG showed positive associations between changes in VO2peak and changes in NPI (Rho = - 0.41, p = 0.042) and changes in SDMT (Rho = 0.36, p = 0.010), respectively.","Aerobic exercise improves VO2peak in community-dwelling patients with mild AD.

cultural diversity and growing elderly immigrant populations in Western European countries, the availability of brief cognitive screening instruments adequate for assessment of dementia in people from diverse backgrounds becomes increasingly important. The aim of the present study was to investigate diagnostic accuracy of the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) in a multicultural sample and to calculate normative data as a basis for demographic adjustment of RUDAS scores.","The study was a prospective international cross-sectional multi-center study. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to examine diagnostic accuracy. Regression analysis was used to assess the impact of demographic variables.","Data was collected from 341 cognitively intact participants and 80 people with dementia with a wide age- and educational range. Of the 421 included participants, 239 (57%) had immigrant background. The RUDAS had high diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. The optimal cut-off score was &lt;25 (sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.90). Regression analysis revealed that RUDAS scores were mainly affected by education and were unrelated to data collection site and immigrant status. Education-adjusted normative data was calculated as a basis for education adjustment of RUDAS scores. Applying education-adjusted RUDAS scores slightly but significantly improved diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.95.","We found the RUDAS to have excellent diagnostic properties in our multicultural sample. However, we suggest that RUDAS scores should be adjusted for education to increase diagnostic accuracy and that the choice of cut-off score should be considered based on the clinical context and expected base rate of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nielsen","ForeName":"T

Absolute and relative power was calculated for both eyes closed and open condition.","At group level using relative power, we found significant increases globally in the theta band and decreases in high frequency power in the temporal regions for eyes closed for AD and, to a lesser extent, for MCI compared to HC. Relative theta power was significantly correlated with multiple neuropsychological measures and had the largest correlation coefficient with total tau. At the individual level, the classification rate for AD and HC was 72.9% for relative power with eyes closed.","Our findings suggest that the increase in relative theta power may be the first change in patients with dementia due to AD. At the individual level, we found a moderate classification rate for AD and HC when using EEGs alone."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Musaeus","ForeName":"Christian

(AD). Understanding the association between amyloid aggregation and cognitive manifestation in persons without dementia is important for a better understanding of the course of AD and for the design of prevention trials.","To investigate whether amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation is associated with cognitive functioning in persons without dementia.","This cross-sectional study included 2908 participants with normal cognition and 4133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from 53 studies in the multicenter Amyloid Biomarker Study. Normal cognition was defined as having no cognitive concerns for which medical help was sought and scores within the normal range on cognitive tests. Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed according to published criteria. Study inclusion began in 2013 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed in January 2017.","Global cognitive performance as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and episodic memory performance as assessed by a verbal word learning test. Amyloid aggregation was measured with positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and dichotomized as negative (normal) or positive (abnormal) according to study-specific cutoffs. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between amyloid aggregation and low cognitive scores (MMSE score \u226427 or memory z score\u2264-1.28) and to assess whether this association was moderated by age, sex, educational level, or apolipoprotein E genotype.","Among 2908 persons with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [12.8] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory scores after age 70 years (mean difference in amyloid positive vs negative, 4% [95% CI, 0%-7%] at 72 years and 21% [95% CI, 10%-33%] at 90 years) but was not associated with low MMSE scores (mean difference, 3% [95% CI, -1% to 6%], P\u2009=\u2009.16). Among 4133 patients with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.5] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory (mean difference, 16% [95% CI, 12%-20%], P\u2009<\u2009.001) and low MMSE (mean difference, 14% [95% CI, 12%-17%], P\u2009<\u2009.001) scores, and this association decreased with age. Low cognitive scores had limited utility for screening of amyloid positivity in persons with normal cognition and those with MCI. In persons with normal cognition, the age-related increase in low memory score paralleled the age-related increase in amyloid positivity with an intervening period of 10 to 15 years.","Although low memory scores are an early marker of amyloid positivity, their value as a screening measure for early AD among persons without dementia is limited."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jansen","ForeName":"Willemijn

Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal studies indicate that exercise may be disease modifying through several mechanisms including reduction of AD pathology. We carried out a systematic review of intervention studies of physical exercise with hippocampal volume (on MRI), amyloid-\u03b2, total tau, phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 18F-FDG-PET or amyloid PET as outcome measures in healthy subjects, patients with subjective memory complaints, mild cognitive impairment, or AD. We identified a total of 8 studies of which 6 investigated the effects of exercise on hippocampal volume in healthy subjects and 1 on CSF biomarkers and 1 on hippocampal volume in AD, and none investigating the remaining outcome measures or patient groups. Methodological quality of identified studies was generally low. One study found a detrimental effect on hippocampal volume and one found a positive effect, whereas the remaining studies did not find an effect of exercise on outcome measures. The present systematic study identified a relatively small number of studies, which did not support an effect of exercise on hippocampal volume. Methodological issues such small to moderate sample sizes and inadequate ramdomization procedures further limits conclusions. Our findings highlight the difficulties in conducting high quality studies of exercise and further studies are needed before definite conclusions may be reached."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Frederiksen","ForeName":"Kristian Steen","Initials":"KS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gjerum","ForeName":"Le","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hasselbalch","ForeName":"Steen Gregers","Initials":"SG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Biomarkers"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","metabolism","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Biomarkers","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Exercise","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Hippocampus","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Physical Therapy Modalities"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["18F-FDG-PET","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","amyloid-\u03b2","dementia","hippocampus","magnetic resonance imaging","phosphorylated tau","physical activity","physical exercise","total tau"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29154278","JAD170567","10.3233\/JAD-170567"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28984603","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"30"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"60","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2017"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"Relation of Odor Identification with Alzheimer's Disease Markers in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Cognition.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1025-1034"},"ELocationID":"10.3233\/JAD-170564","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Impaired olfactory function is an early characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it remains unclear if odor identification also relates to early markers of AD in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).","To investigate the association between odor identification and amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b242) and total tau (t-tau) concentrations in CSF.

TMEM106B gene have been identified as a risk factor in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The major allele of SNP rs3173615 is a risk factor in sporadic FTD, whereas the minor allele seems protective in GRN- and C9orf72-mediated FTD. The role of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) in FTD is uncertain, though an established risk factor in Alzheimer's disease. In a unique Danish family, inherited FTD is caused by a mutation in the CHMP2B gene located on chromosome 3 (FTD-3). In this family, both risk factors TMEM106B and ApoE were analyzed and correlated to age at onset (AAO) and progression in terms of age at institutionalization (AAI) and age at death (AAD). Although TMEM106B and CHMP2B share cellular function in that both localize to endolysosomes, TMEM106B genotypes appeared to have no influence on the clinical disease course. ApoE \u03b54 was found to be a protective factor with later AAO and AAI, whereas \u03b52 seemed to aggravate the disease with earlier AAO and AAD. These results indicate ApoE \u03b52 as a risk factor in FTD-3 and suggest a protective role of \u03b54.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods The present study comprised 4766 participants from the Copenhagen Male Study. We used information on shift work (collected in 1970-1971 and 1985-1986), long working hours defined as >45 hours per week (collected in 1970-1971), socioeconomic status, sleep, stress, and cardiovascular risk factors. Information about dementia diagnoses was obtained from registers. Participants were followed until 2014 (mean length of follow-up was 17.8 years). We employed Poisson regression for the survival analyses and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results We found no statistically significant association between shift work (IRR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.05) or long working hours (IRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79-1.19) and dementia. Adjustment for potential confounders and mediators did not change the estimates. Working shifts at both time points of exposure assessment was not associated with a higher incidence of dementia compared with non-shift workers at both time points (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.69-1.42). The lowest incidence of dementia was observed among participants who reported shift work at one time point (only in 1985-1986: IRR 0.44, 95% CI 0.16-1.23 and only in 1970-1971: IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-1.11). Conclusion We did not find positive evidence of an association between shift work or long working hours and the incidence of dementia, but the negative findings may reflect the crude assessment of shift work and long working hours, which is a major limitation of the present study."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nabe-Nielsen","ForeName":"Kirsten","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, \u00d8ster Farimagsgade 5, 1014 Copenhagen, Denmark.

dementia prevalence are scarce. A pilot study was conducted in Lebanon to assess dementia prevalence, using the Arabic-validated 10\/66 Dementia Research Group (DRG) diagnostic assessment for case ascertainment. The study also examined care arrangement and access to care.","A random sample of 502 persons older than 65\u00a0years and their informant were recruited from Beirut and Mount Lebanon governorates through multistage cluster sampling.","The crude and age-standardized dementia prevalences were 7.4% and 9.0%, respectively. People with dementia were mainly cared for by relatives at home. Access to formal care was very limited.","Dementia prevalence in Lebanon ranks high within the global range of estimates. These first evidence-based data about disease burden and barriers to care serve to raise awareness and call for social and health care reform to tackle the dementia epidemic in Lebanon and in North Africa and the Middle East."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 the Alzheimer's Association.

The working group recommended using CSF AD biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of MCI patients, after prebiomarker counseling, as an add-on to clinical evaluation to predict functional decline or conversion to AD dementia and to guide disease management. Because of insufficient evidence, it was uncertain whether CSF AD biomarkers outperform imaging biomarkers. Furthermore, the working group provided recommendations for interpretation of ambiguous CSF biomarker results and for pre- and post-biomarker counseling.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

in immigrant populations, but knowledge about the quality of treatment and care for dementia is still lacking.","To conduct a nationwide registry-based study to determine whether inequality exists regarding access to anti-dementia treatment and care between immigrant and Danish-born patients with dementia.","A cross-sectional register-based study was conducted in the entire elderly (60\u2265years) population with dementia in Denmark in 2012 (n\u200a=\u200a34,877). The use of anti-dementia drugs and residency in a nursing home were compared among Danish-born and Western and non-Western immigrants with dementia. Logistic regression analysis was done with adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, marital status, basis of inclusion, and time since dementia diagnosis.","Immigrant background was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of receiving anti-dementia drug therapy (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]): non-Western\u200a=\u200a0.70 [0.56-0.87]; Western\u200a=\u200a0.74 [0.63-0.87]). No significant differences were found in type or amount of anti-dementia medication dispensed between the population groups (proxy measure for adherence). Non-Western immigrants were significantly less likely to live in a nursing home (0.52 [0.41-0.65]).","This nationwide registry-based study indicated a worrisome difference in access to anti-dementia treatment and care for dementia patients with an immigrant background, but similar levels of adherence compared with the Danish-born population. Further research is necessary to pinpoint barriers to access to suitable healthcare among elderly immigrants with dementia but also to identify and develop culturally sensitive methods for their treatment and care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stevnsborg","ForeName":"Lea","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Centre (DDRC), Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jensen-Dahm","ForeName":"Christina","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Centre (DDRC), Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nielsen","ForeName":"Thomas R","Initials":"TR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Centre (DDRC), Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gasse","ForeName":"Christiane","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"National Centre for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Centre (DDRC), Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["economics","epidemiology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Denmark","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Emigrants and Immigrants"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Accessibility","QualifierName":["economics","trends"]},{"DescriptorName":"Healthcare Disparities","QualifierName":["economics","trends"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":["economics","trends"]},{"DescriptorName":"Registries"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","drug therapy","emigrants and immigrants and","healthcare \ndisparities","medication adherence","nursing homes"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27567820","JAD160124","10.3233\/JAD-160124"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27345998","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1876-7753","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Stem cell research","ISOAbbreviation":"Stem Cell Res"},"ArticleTitle":"Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from an Alzheimer's disease patient carrying a M146I mutation in PSEN1.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"334-7"},"ELocationID":["10.1016\/j.scr.2016.01.001","S1873-5061(16)00011-8"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Skin fibroblasts were obtained from a 46-year-old symptomatic man carrying a M146I mutation in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1), responsible for causing Alzheimer's disease (AD).

However, the predictive value of SRH to NH placement and mortality among elderly people is not consistent. This may be due to cognitive impairment. Since the SRH item is widely used, it is important to know whether SRH has different predictive value among people with cognitive impairments. We aimed to examine SRH and the risk of permanent NH placement and mortality among people with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).","Data are from The Danish Alzheimer Intervention StudY (DAISY), a large randomized controlled trial of psychosocial intervention for patients with mild dementia and their caregivers with 3-years' follow-up. Five out of 14 Danish counties participated and 321 home-living elderly (mean age: 76.2 years) with mild AD (46.4 % male) were included during 2004 and 2005. Self-rated SRH, cognitive function (MMSE), quality of life (proxy-rated QOL-AD), activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL), insight, and socio-demographics were assessed at baseline. Comorbidities and information about NH placement and mortality was obtained over 3-years' follow-up from registries. With Cox proportional hazard regression we analysed the association between SRH (dichotomised into good vs. poor) and NH placement and mortality adjusted for potential confounders.","At baseline 66 % reported excellent or good, and 34 % fair, poor or very poor SRH. Mean MMSE was 24.0 (range: 20-30). NH placement and mortality totalled 28.1 % and 16.5 % at 3-years' follow-up, respectively. Poor SRH at baseline was not related to increased risk of NH placement or to increased mortality neither in the univariable nor in multivariable analysis: In the fully adjusted models HR was 0.63 (95 % CI 0.38-1.05) and 1.28 (95 % CI 0.67-2.45), respectively.","When poor SRH was present we found no increased risk for NH placement or death among elderly people with mild AD.

Results from studies on subjective cognitive decline are difficult to compare due to variability in assessment methods, and little is known about how different methods influence reports of cognitive decline.","The Subjective Memory Complaints Scale (SMC) and The Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q) were applied in 121 mixed memory clinic patients with mild cognitive symptoms (mean MMSE = 26.8, SD 2.7). The scales were applied independently and raters were blinded to results from the other scale. Scales were not used for diagnostic classification. Cognitive performances and depressive symptoms were also rated. We studied the association between the two measures and investigated the scales' relation to depressive symptoms, age, and cognitive status.","SMC and MAC-Q were significantly associated (r = 0.44, N = 121, p = 0.015) and both scales had a wide range of scores. In this mixed cohort of patients, younger age was associated with higher SMC scores. There were no significant correlations between cognitive test performances and scales measuring subjective decline. Depression scores were significantly correlated to both scales measuring subjective decline. Linear regression models showed that age did not have a significant contribution to the variance in subjective memory beyond that of depressive symptoms.","Measures for subjective cognitive decline are not interchangeable when used in memory clinics and the application of different scales in previous studies is an important factor as to why studies show variability in the association between subjective cognitive decline and background data and\/or clinical results.

The aim of the present study was to characterize certain aspects of neuropathology and inflammatory markers related to aging and CCD in dogs in comparison with human AD. Fifteen brains from aged dogs with normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, or CCD were investigated and compared with two control brains from young dogs and brain sections from human AD subjects. The neuropathological investigations included evaluation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaque deposition (N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamyl-modified A\u03b2 included), tau pathology, and inflammatory markers in prefrontal cortex. Cortical A\u03b2 deposition was found to be only of the diffuse subtype as no dense-core or neuritic plaques were found. The A\u03b2 deposition followed a progressive pattern in four maturation stages. Accumulation of the A\u03b2 peptide was also observed in the vessel walls. Both immunohistochemically and biochemically measured levels of A\u03b2 pathology in prefrontal cortex showed a consistent positive correlation to age but not to cognitive deficit severity. No evidence of neurofibrillary tau pathology was found. The level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was generally low and showed no significant association to cognitive status. The findings of the present study support the senescent dog with spontaneous cognitive dysfunction as a valuable non-transgenic model for further investigations of the molecular events involved in the neurodegenerative processes associated with aging and early stage AD, especially the A\u03b2-related pathology."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sch\u00fctt","ForeName":"Trine","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Veterinary Clinical and Animal Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurodegeneration, H.

Recent reports suggest that dysfunctional mitochondria and DNA damage are associated with AD development. In this report, we measured various cellular parameters, related to mitochondrial bioenergetics and DNA damage, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AD and control participants, for biomarker discovery.","PBMCs were isolated from 53 patients with AD of mild to moderate degree and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Tests were performed on the PBMCs from as many of these participants as possible. We measured glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration fluxes using the Seahorse Bioscience flux analyzer, mitochondrial ROS production using flow cytometry, dNTP levels by way of a DNA polymerization assay, DNA strand breaks using the Fluorometric detection of Alkaline DNA Unwinding (FADU) assay, and APE1 incision activity (in cell lysates) on a DNA substrate containing an AP site (to estimate DNA repair efficiency).","In the PBMCs of AD patients, we found reduced basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption, reduced proton leak, higher dATP level, and lower AP endonuclease 1 activity, depending on adjustments for gender and\/or age.","This study reveals impaired mitochondrial respiration, altered dNTP pools and reduced DNA repair activity in PBMCs of AD patients, thus suggesting that these biochemical activities may be useful as biomarkers for AD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Maynard","ForeName":"Scott","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

Antipsychotics have been associated with increased risk of adverse events and mortality in patients with dementia, leading to safety regulations worldwide.","To investigate time trends in use of antipsychotics and other psychotropic drugs in dementia care.","The study included longitudinal data on all Danish residents \u226565 years. The study population was defined on January 1 of each year from 2000-2012. Data included prescriptions, discharge diagnoses, and somatic and psychiatric comorbidities. Multivariate time trend analyses of psychotropic drug use in patients with dementia within 4-year age bands were performed.","Overall, among patients with dementia the prevalence of antipsychotic drug use decreased from 31.3% in 2000 to 20.4% in 2012. The decreasing use of antipsychotics was accompanied by decreasing use of anxiolytics and hypnotics\/sedatives, but an increase in the use of antidepressants from 43.3% in 2000 to 53.8% in 2012. These changes were significant across almost all age groups. Treatment intensity among patients using antipsychotics increased as the annual median number of defined daily doses (DDD) increased from 33.3 to 42.0 DDD.","The changing patterns of psychotropic drug use may be caused by warnings against use of antipsychotics.

The aims of this study were to compare knowledge and perceptions of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) among four ethnic groups in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to assess the influence of education and acculturation.","Quantitative survey data from 260 participants were analyzed: 100 native Danish, and 47 Polish, 51 Turkish, and 62 Pakistani immigrants. Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD were assessed with the Dementia Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ) supplemented with two questions from the Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Test (ADAT). Knowledge and perceptions of dementia and AD in the four groups were compared, and the influence of education and acculturation was assessed.","Group differences were found on the DKQ total score as well as all sub-domains. Turkish and Pakistani people were most likely to hold normalizing and stigmatizing views of AD. Level of education and acculturation had limited influence on dementia knowledge, accounting for 22% of the variance at most and had only minor influence on perceptions of AD.","Lacking knowledge and certain perceptions of dementia and AD may hamper access to services in some ethnic minority groups. Ongoing efforts to raise awareness that dementia and AD are not part of normal aging, particularly among Turkish and Pakistani communities, should be a high priority for educational outreach."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nielsen","ForeName":"T Rune","Initials":"TR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"04"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Acculturation"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["ethnology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["ethnology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Denmark"},{"DescriptorName":"Ethnic Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Accessibility"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Pakistan","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Poland","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Stigma"},{"DescriptorName":"Turkey","QualifierName":"ethnology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer's disease","acculturation","dementia","education","ethnic minority","knowledge"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"30"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"04"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"08"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"6","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"6","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26040575","10.1002\/gps.4314"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25998699","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"01","Day":"15"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"07","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"40","Issue":"1-2","PubDate":{"Year":"2015"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers in Familial Forms of Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"54-62"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000381828","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"As dementia is a fast-growing health care problem, it is becoming an increasingly urgent need to provide an early diagnosis in order to offer patients the best medical treatment and care. Validated biomarkers which reflect the pathology and disease progression are essential for diagnosis and are important when developing new therapies. Today, the core protein biomarkers amyloid-\u03b242, total tau and phosphorylated tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD), because these biomarkers have shown to reflect the underlying amyloid and tau pathology. However, the biomarkers have proved insufficient predictors of dementias with a different pathology, e.g. frontotemporal dementia (FTD); furthermore, the biomarkers are not useful for early AD diagnosis. Familial dementias with a known disease-causing mutation can be extremely valuable to study; yet the biomarker profiles in patients with familial dementias are not clear. This review summarizes CSF biomarker findings from studies on symptomatic and presymptomatic individuals carrying a mutation in one of the genes known to cause early-onset familial AD or FTD. In conclusion, the biomarker profile of inherited AD is quite similar between carriers of different mutations as well as similar to the profile found in sporadic AD, whereas familial FTD does not seem to have a clear biomarker profile. Hence, new biomarkers are needed for FTD.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2015 S.

investigated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD) and healthy elderly controls using the cold pressor test tolerance and repetitive stimuli of warmth and heat stimuli, evaluating the stimulus-response function.","A case-control design was applied examining 33 patients with mild to moderate AD dementia and 32 healthy controls with the cold pressor test (4\u00b0C). Warmth detection threshold (WDT) and heat pain threshold (HPT) were assessed using 5 stimulations. A stimulus-response function was estimated using 4 incrementally increasing suprathreshold heat stimuli.","Cold pressor tolerance was lower in patients with AD dementia than in controls (p = 0.027). There were no significant differences between groups regarding WDT and HPT. Significant successive increases in HPT assessments indicated habituation (p < 0.0001), which was similar in the 2 groups (p = 0.85). A mixed model for repeated measures demonstrated that pain rating of suprathreshold stimuli depended on HPT (p = 0.0004) and stimulus intensity (p < 0.0001). Patients with AD dementia had significantly lower increases in pain ratings than controls during suprathreshold stimulation (p = 0.0072).","Our results indicate that AD dementia is not associated with a propensity toward development of sensitization or a lack of habituation, suggesting preservation of sensory-discriminative aspects of pain perception. The results further suggest that the attenuated cold pressor pain tolerance may relate to impairment of coping abilities. Paradoxically, we found an attenuated stimulus-response function, compared to controls, suggesting that AD dementia interferes with pain ratings over time, most likely due to memory impairment."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2015 American Academy of

Based on epidemiological data we have calculated possible estimates for the present Danish prevalence of dementia and prevalence projections through to 2030. The discrepancy between estimates based on epidemiological studies and the number of dementia diagnoses in registers indicates that dementia may be underdiagnosed.

We examined whether physical activity modifies processing speed, executive function and memory in a population of non-dementia elderly subjects with age-related white matter changes (ARWMC).","Data from the Leukoaraiosis And DISability (LADIS) study, a multicenter, European prospective cohort study aimed at examining the role of ARWMC in transition to disability, was used. Subjects in the LADIS study were clinically assessed yearly for 3 years including MRI at baseline and 3-year follow-up.

Multiple variable linear regression analysis with baseline MMSE, education, gender, age, stroke, diabetes and ARWMC rating as covariates revealed that physical activity was associated with better scores at baseline and 3-year follow-up for executive function (baseline: \u03b2: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.13-0.90, p = 0.008; follow-up: \u03b2: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.38, p = 0.001) and processing speed (baseline: \u03b2: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.14-0.89, p = 0.005; follow-up: \u03b2: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.02-0.29, p = 0.02) but not memory.

The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance.","Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T.","The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local protocols (absolute left\/right ICC 0.44\/0.43) and much higher with the HarP (absolute left\/right ICC 0.88\/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases, the HarP agreement within (left\/right ICC range: 0.94\/0.95 to 0.99\/0.99) and among tracers (left\/right ICC range: 0.89\/0.90) was very high. The volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9% of the total, comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2), atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4), and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5%, P < .001), and physiological variability (49.2%, P < .001).","The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human tracers.

We investigated awareness in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) over 36 months and studied if a decline in awareness was associated with decline in cognition and increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms.","Awareness was measured on a categorical scale in 95 AD patients (age \u226550 years, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score \u226520). Awareness was rated at three time points (follow-up at 12 and 36 months) where MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q), and Cornell scale for Depression in Dementia also were applied.","At 12 months, 26% had lower awareness rating as compared to baseline and at 36 months lower awareness ratings were found in 39%. At both visits, 16% had higher awareness rating as compared to baseline. Patients with lower awareness at 36 months as compared to baseline had a more rapid increase in NPI-Q score (p = 0.002) over 36 months as compared to patients with stable or improved awareness over 36 months. A more rapid decline in MMSE score was observed for patients with lower awareness at 36 months (as compared to baseline) but only when compared to patients in whom awareness improved over time.","The results show essentially no clear relationship between cognitive decline over three years and awareness.

We explored the effect of further reducing the number of scoring items on classification accuracy and estimated classification accuracy associated with performances deviating from the optimal cutoff score. At a cutoff of 5\/6, the six-item CDT had a sensitivity (SN) of 0.65 and a specificity of 0.80. Stepwise removal of up to three items reduced SN slightly. Classification accuracy associated with a score of four or less out of six was very high.

Validated diagnostic instruments for dementia in Arabic are lacking, hampering the development of dementia research in the region. The study aimed at validating the Arabic version of the 10\/66 Dementia Research Group (DRG) diagnostic assessment for dementia to determine whether it is suitable for case ascertainment in epidemiological research.","A total of 244 participants older than 65 years were included, 100 with normal cognition and 144 with mild to moderate dementia. Dementia was diagnosed by clinicians according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria. Depression was diagnosed using the Geriatric Mental State. Trained interviewers blind to the cognitive status of the participants administered the 10\/66 DRG diagnostic assessment to the participants and interviewed the caregivers. The discriminatory ability of the 10\/66 DRG assessment and its subcomponents were evaluated against the clinical diagnoses.","Half of the participants had no formal education and 49% of them were depressed. The 10\/66 DRG diagnostic assessment showed excellent sensitivity (92.0%), specificity (95.1%), positive predictive value (PPV, 92.9%), and low false-positive rates among controls with no formal education (8.1%) and depression (5.6%). Each subcomponent of the 10\/66 DRG diagnostic assessment independently predicted dementia diagnosis. The predictive ability of the 10\/66 DRG assessment was superior to that of its subcomponents.","The 10\/66 DRG diagnostic assessment for dementia is well suited for case ascertainment in

frequently than their cognitively intact peers. It has been hypothesized that pain processing is altered in AD. The aim of this study was to investigate agreement and reliability of 3 pain sensitivity tests and to examine pain threshold and tolerance in patients with AD. We examined 29 patients with mild to moderate AD and 29 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects with quantitative sensory testing, ie, assessments of detection threshold (warmth detection threshold [WDT]) and pain threshold (heat pain threshold [HPT], pressure algometry, cold pressor test), and assessments of tolerance (pressure algometry, cold pressor test). All procedures were done twice on day 1, 1 hour apart, and repeated on day 2. We found no difference between groups for WDT (patient vs control subjects: mean [95% confidence interval]: 35.5\u00b0C [33.4\u00b0C to 37.6\u00b0C] vs 35.4\u00b0C [34.3\u00b0C to 36.5\u00b0C], P=.8) or HPT (41.2\u00b0C [40.0\u00b0C to 42.4\u00b0C] vs 42.3\u00b0C [41.1\u00b0C to 43.5\u00b0C], P=.24). We observed comparable thresholds for pressure algometry (median [25% to 75% interquartile range]: 120 kPa [100 to 142 kPa] vs 131 kPa [113 to 192 kPa], P=.10), but significantly lower tolerance in AD patients (213 kPa [188 to 306 kPa] vs 289 kPa [262 to 360 kPa], P=.008). No differences were found for the cold pressor test. The study demonstrated good replicability of the sensory testing data with comparable data variability, for both groups, which supports the use of these methods in studies of patients with mild to moderate AD. Contrary to previous studies, we observed a reduced pain tolerance in patients with mild to moderate AD, which suggests that the reduced report of pain cannot be explained by reduced processing of painful stimuli.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.

system (PredictAD tool) and current research criteria of prodromal AD as identified by combinations of episodic memory impairment of hippocampal type and visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on MRI and CSF biomarkers.","Altogether 391 MCI cases (158 AD converters) were selected from the ADNI cohort. All the cases had baseline cognitive tests, MRI and\/or CSF levels of A\u03b21-42 and Tau. Using baseline data, the status of MCI patients (AD or MCI) three years later was predicted using current diagnostic research guidelines and the PredictAD software tool designed for supporting clinical diagnostics. The data used were 1) clinical criteria for episodic memory loss of the hippocampal type, 2) visual MTA, 3) positive CSF markers, 4) their combinations, and 5) when the PredictAD tool was applied, automatically computed MRI measures were used instead of the visual MTA results. The accuracies of diagnosis were evaluated with the diagnosis made 3 years later.","The PredictAD tool achieved the overall accuracy of 72% (sensitivity 73%, specificity 71%) in predicting the AD diagnosis. The corresponding number for a clinician's prediction with the assistance of the PredictAD tool was 71% (sensitivity 75%, specificity 68%). Diagnosis with the PredictAD tool was significantly better than diagnosis by biomarkers alone or the combinations of clinical diagnosis of hippocampal pattern for the memory loss and biomarkers (p\u22640.037).","With the assistance of PredictAD tool, the clinician can predict AD conversion more accurately than the current diagnostic criteria."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Liu","ForeName":"Yawu","Initials":"Y","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

In Europe the average delay is 20 months. Nevertheless, patient data preceding clinical AD diagnoses often contains early signs of the disease. Several studies have analyzed data of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, showing that conversion from MCI to AD can be predicted with a classification accuracy of 60-80%. This accuracy may not be high enough for influencing diagnostic decisions. In this work, the prediction problem is approached differently; a target prediction accuracy is defined first and is then used for identifying MCI patients for whom the required accuracy can be reached. The process uses a novel disease state index method in which patient data are statistically compared to a high number of previously diagnosed cases. It is shown that the disease index values derived from heterogeneous patient data can be used for identifying groups of patients for whom the prediction accuracy reaches the previously set target level. The results also show that 12 months before receiving clinical AD diagnoses, approximately half (51.5%, 95% confidence interval: 48.6-54.2%) of MCI subjects who progressed to AD can be classified with a high accuracy of 87.7%, possibly enough to support earlier diagnostic decisions."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mattila","ForeName":"Jussi","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Tampere, Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soininen","ForeName":"Hilkka","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koikkalainen","ForeName":"Juha","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rueckert","ForeName":"Daniel","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wolz","ForeName":"Robin","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"L\u00f6tj\u00f6nen","ForeName":"Jyrki","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"K01 AG030514","Acronym":"AG","Agency":"NIA NIH HHS","Country":"United States"},{"GrantID":"P30 AG010129","Acronym":"AG","Agency":"NIA NIH HHS","Country":"United States"},{"GrantID":"U01 AG024904","Acronym":"AG","Agency":"NIA NIH HHS","Country":"United States"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Dysfunction","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Databases, Factual","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests","QualifierName":"standards"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"8","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22890102","81H2T67710622437","10.3233\/JAD-2012-120934"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22717281","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Comparison of performance on three neuropsychological tests in healthy Turkish immigrants and Danish elderly.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1515-21"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610212000440","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Appropriate neuropsychological tests for cross-cultural assessment of dementia in elderly ethnic and linguistic minorities are generally lacking in Europe.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether white matter hyperintensities (WMH), frequently identified on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in elderly subjects with and without cognitive impairment, may contribute to variations in PPI. A passive acoustic PPI paradigm was applied in 92 human subjects (53 healthy and 39 patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment) between 60 and 85years of age. WMH were rated visually on craniel MRI FLAIR images using the Fazekas scale. WMH were identified in 70% of all subjects. The latency to peak of the startle response increased significantly with increasing WMH load, whereas the inhibition of the startle response (PPI) was neither significantly related to the degree of WMH nor to cognitive performance. We conclude that the presence of WMH in the fronto-striatal brain circuit may affect the latency of the startle response, but not information processing in elderly subjects.","CopyrightInformation":"2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Data mining projects sponsored by industry that use these databases, however, are often not viewed favourably in the academic medical community because of concerns that commercial, rather than scientific, goals are the primary purpose of such endeavours. Thus, there are few examples of sustained collaboration between leading academic clinical researchers and industry professionals in a large-scale data mining project. We present here a successful example of this type of collaboration in the field of dementia.","The Donepezil Data Repository comprised 18 randomised, controlled trials conducted between 1991 and 2005. The project team at Pfizer determined that the data mining process should be guided by a diverse group of leading Alzheimer's disease clinical researchers called the \"Expert Working Group.\" After development of a list of potential faculty members, invitations were extended and a group of seven members was assembled. The Working Group met regularly with Eisai\/Pfizer clinicians and statisticians to discuss the data, identify issues that were currently of interest in the academic and clinical communities that might lend themselves to investigation using these data, and note gaps in understanding or knowledge of Alzheimer's disease that these data could address. Leadership was provided by the Pfizer Clinical Development team leader; Working Group members rotated responsibility for being lead and co-lead for each investigation and resultant publication.","Six manuscripts, each published in a leading subspecialty journal, resulted from the group's work. Another project resulted in poster presentations at international congresses and two were cancelled due to resource constraints.","The experience represents a particular approach to optimising the value of data mining of large clinical trial databases for the combined purpose of furthering clinical research and improving patient care. Fruitful collaboration between industry and academia was fostered while the donepezil data repository was used to advance clinical and scientific knowledge. The Expert Working Group approach warrants consideration as a blueprint for conducting similar research ventures in the future."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Roy","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Institute for the Care of Older People, Royal United Hospital, Combe Park, Bath BA1 3NG, UK.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature on validity and reliability of clinically applicable, multidomain, and dementia staging instruments. A total of 23 articles describing 12 staging instruments were identified (N = 6109 participants, age 65-87). Reliability was studied in most (91%) of the articles and was judged moderate to good. Approximately 78% of the articles evaluated concurrent validity, which was good to very good, while discriminant validity was assessed in only 25%. The scales can be applied in \u00b115 minutes. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), Global Deterioration scale (GDS), and Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) have been monitored on reliability and validity, and the CDR currently is the best-evidenced scale, also studied in international perspective, and is available in 14 languages. Taking into account the increasing differentiation of Alzheimer's disease in preclinical and predementia stages, there is an urgent need for global rating scales to be refined as well."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rikkert","ForeName":"Marcel G M Olde","Initials":"MG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatrics, Alzheimer Centre Nijmegen, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Netherlands. m.olde-rikkert@ger.umcn.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tona","ForeName":"Klodiana Daphne","Initials":"KD"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Janssen","ForeName":"Lieneke","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burns","ForeName":"Alistair","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lobo","ForeName":"Anatonio","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sartorius","ForeName":"Norman","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stoppe","ForeName":"Gabriela","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"13"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen","NlmUniqueID":"101082834","ISSNLinking":"1533-3175"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"2","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21914671","1533317511418954","10.1177\/1533317511418954"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21841255","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"08","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2011"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"Self-perceived memory complaints predict progression to Alzheimer disease.

Our objective was to evaluate the risk of self perceived memory complaints in the evolution for future dementia. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability) prospective multinational European study evaluates the impact of white matter changes (WMC) on the transition of independent elderly subjects into disability. Independent elderly were enrolled due to the presence of WMC. Subjects were evaluated yearly during 3 years with a comprehensive clinical protocol and a neuropsychological battery. Dementia and subtypes of dementia were classified. Self perceived memory complaints in independent elderly were collected during the interview. MRI was performed at entry and at the end of the study. 639 subjects were included (74.1 \u00b1 5 years old, 55% women, 9.6 \u00b1 3.8 years of schooling). At end of follow-up, 90 patients were demented (vascular dementia, 54; Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD with vascular component, 34; frontotemporal dementia, 2). Using Cox regression analysis, we found that self perceived memory complaints were a strong predictor of AD and AD with vascular component during the follow-up (\u03b2 = 2.7, p = 0.008; HR = 15.5, CI 95% [2.04, 117.6]), independently of other confounders, namely depressive symptoms, WMC severity, medial temporal lobe atrophy, and global cognition status at baseline. Self perceived memory complaints did not predict vascular dementia. In the LADIS study, self perceived memory complaints predicted AD but not vascular dementia in elderly subjects with WMC living independently."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verdelho","ForeName":"Ana","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neurosciences

Knowledge about disease-specific biomarkers is constantly increasing and larger volumes of data are being measured from patients. To gain additional benefits from the collected data, a novel statistical modeling and data visualization system is proposed for supporting clinical diagnosis of AD. The proposed system computes an evidence-based estimate of a patient's AD state by comparing his or her heterogeneous neuropsychological, clinical, and biomarker data to previously diagnosed cases. The AD state in this context denotes a patient's degree of similarity to previously diagnosed disease population. A summary of patient data and results of the computation are displayed in a succinct Disease State Fingerprint (DSF) visualization. The visualization clearly discloses how patient data contributes to the AD state, facilitating rapid interpretation of the information. To model the AD state from complex and heterogeneous patient data, a statistical Disease State Index (DSI) method underlying the DSF has been developed. Using baseline data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the ability of the DSI to model disease progression from elderly healthy controls to AD and its ability to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD were assessed. It was found that the DSI provides well-behaving AD state estimates, corresponding well with the actual diagnoses. For predicting conversion from MCI to AD, the DSI attains performance similar to state-of-the-art reference classifiers. The results suggest that the DSF establishes an effective decision support and data visualization framework for improving AD diagnostics, allowing clinicians to rapidly analyze large quantities of diverse patient data."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mattila","ForeName":"Jussi","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Tampere, Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koikkalainen","ForeName":"Juha","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Virkki","ForeName":"Arho","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Simonsen","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Gils","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soininen","ForeName":"Hilkka","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"L\u00f6tj\u00f6nen","ForeName":"Jyrki","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"K01 AG030514","Acronym":"AG","Agency":"NIA NIH HHS","Country":"United States"},{"GrantID":"P30 AG010129","Acronym":"AG","Agency":"NIA NIH HHS","Country":"United States"},{"GrantID":"U01 AG024904","Acronym":"AG","Agency":"NIA NIH HHS","Country":"United States"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Biomarkers"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis"]},{"DescriptorName":"Biomarkers","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cohort Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dermatoglyphics"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Predictive Value of Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Probability"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Sensitivity and Specificity"},{"DescriptorName":"Statistics as Topic"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"3","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21799247","KG54325631131N10","10.3233\/JAD-2011-110365"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21729415","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"03","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Proxy-rated quality of life in Alzheimer's disease: a three-year longitudinal study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"82-9"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610211001128","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The study investigated the change in proxy rated quality of life (QoL) of a large cohort of home living patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) over a period of 36 months.","The sample consisted of 102 patients with mild AD and their primary caregivers from the Danish Alzheimer's Disease Intervention Study.

TBM analysis requires non-rigid registrations which are often subject to registration errors. When using multiple templates and, therefore, multiple registrations, it can be assumed that the registration errors are averaged and eventually compensated. Four different methods are proposed for multi-template TBM. The methods were evaluated using magnetic resonance (MR) images of healthy controls, patients with stable or progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the ADNI database (N=772). The performance of TBM features in classifying images was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Classification results show that the multi-template methods are statistically significantly better than the single-template method. The overall classification accuracy was 86.0% for the classification of control and AD subjects, and 72.1% for the classification of stable and progressive MCI subjects. The statistical group-level difference maps produced using multi-template TBM were smoother, formed larger continuous regions, and had larger t-values than the maps obtained with single-template TBM.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In total, 268 patients were included. We used a cut off of 4% in 1 year for defining weight loss. The mean age at inclusion was 76.1 years. Sixty-six patients (24.6%) lost more than 4% of their body weight during the study period. A logistic regression showed that an increase of 1 baseline body mass index point significantly increased the odds of weight loss by 9%. Furthermore, the results suggested a trend that for men, living alone was a risk factor for losing weight, whereas for women living with somebody was associated with a higher risk. However, further studies are pertinent within this area. As weight loss is a predictor of mortality in patients with AD, clinicians should be aware of prognostic social indicators to prevent or halt a potential negative development."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hansen","ForeName":"Marie-Louise H","Initials":"ML","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Memory Disorders Research Group, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldorff","ForeName":"Frans B","Initials":"FB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord","NlmUniqueID":"8704771","ISSNLinking":"0893-0341"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Body Weight"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Prognosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Weight Loss","QualifierName":"physiology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21285857","10.1097\/WAD.0b013e3182096624"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21281717","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"07","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1095-9572","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"56","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"May","Day":"01"}},"Title":"NeuroImage","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuroimage"},"ArticleTitle":"Fast and robust extraction of hippocampus from MR images for diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"185-96"},"ELocationID":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2011.01.062","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Assessment of temporal lobe atrophy from magnetic resonance images is a part of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. As hippocampus is known to be among the first areas affected by the disease, fast and robust definition of hippocampus volume would be of great importance in the clinical decision making. We propose a method for computing automatically the volume of hippocampus using a modified multi-atlas segmentation framework, including an improved initialization of the framework and the correction of partial volume effect. The method produced a high similarity index, 0.87, and correlation coefficient, 0.94, with semi-automatically generated segmentations. When comparing hippocampus volumes extracted from 1.5T and 3T images, the absolute value of the difference was low: 3.2% of the volume. The correct classification rate for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal cases was about 80% while the accuracy 65% was obtained for classifying stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment cases. The method was evaluated in three cohorts consisting altogether about 1000 cases, the main emphasis being in the analysis of the ADNI cohort. The computation time of the method is about 2 minutes on a standard laptop computer. The results show a clear potential for applying the method in clinical practice.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Alzheimer disease (AD), other dementia (OD) or no dementia.","The authors recruited patients from two hospital memory clinics in Copenhagen. The oral examination included an assessment of dental status and dental caries. The authors used a structured questionnaire to obtain information regarding demographic, social and functional variables.","In the baseline study, 106 dentate patients participated. Of these, 77 completed the follow-up study. The participants' mean age was 81.9 years at baseline and 82.5 years at follow-up. At baseline, 87 (82 percent) of 106 participants had dementia and at follow-up, 64 (83 percent) of 77 participants had dementia. The mean number of decayed tooth surfaces was significantly higher at follow-up than at baseline for all participants, and the number was highest for the OD group. The one-year adjusted caries and filling increments (ADJCIs) were high for participants with and without dementia but were highest for participants in the AD and OD groups. Baseline risk factors for developing elevated coronal and root ADJCIs included having caries, having many teeth and being older than 80 years.","Elderly people referred to a memory clinic were at an elevated risk of developing high levels of coronal and root-surface caries during the first year after referral, and those with a dementia diagnosis other than AD appeared to be at a particularly high risk of developing multiple carious lesions during the first year after diagnosis.","These findings underscore the importance of addressing the oral health needs of elderly people suspected of having experienced cognitive decline."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ellefsen","ForeName":"Birita","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Copenhagen Gerontological Oral Health Research Center, School of Dentistry, University of Copenhagen, Norre All\u00e9 20, Copenhagen DK-2200 CPH N, Denmark. bel@odont.ku.dk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holm-Pedersen","ForeName":"Poul","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morse","ForeName":"Douglas E","Initials":"DE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schroll","ForeName":"Marianne","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Andersen","ForeName":"Birgitte Bo","Initials":"BB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Am Dent Assoc","NlmUniqueID":"7503060","ISSNLinking":"0002-8177"},"CitationSubset":["D","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Case-Control Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"DMF Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Denmark"},{"DescriptorName":"Dental Caries","QualifierName":"etiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Logistic Models"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19884398","S0002-8177(14)64590-6","10.14219\/jada.archive.2009.0076"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19786776","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"01","Day":"05"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"28","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2009"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of donepezil in reducing clinical worsening in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"244-51"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000241877","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Therapeutic endpoints based on reduced clinical worsening represent clinically relevant and realistic goals for patients suffering from progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).","Data from 906 patients (388 receiving placebo; 518 receiving donepezil) with mild-to-moderate AD [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 10-27] were pooled from 3 randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled studies.

Alzheimer disease (AD) trials is generally based on benefits over placebo-treated controls. Consequently, variation in rates of decline among placebo-treated patients could impact outcomes from AD trials. In the present analyses, individual patient data [baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): 10 to 26] were pooled from randomized, placebo-controlled studies of donepezil for AD conducted during the 1990s, and grouped by initiation year-group 1: 1990 to 1994; group 2: 1996 to 1999. Changes in MMSE and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) were compared between groups 1 and 2 for placebo, and then between donepezil and placebo. Data were available from 3403 patients in 13 trials. Group 2 (post-1995) included patients with lower baseline MMSE scores, older patients, fewer males, more comorbidity, and more concomitant medications. MMSE decline by week 24 was significantly greater among group 1 (pre-1995) placebo patients versus group 2; a similar trend was observed with the ADAS-cog. Nevertheless, donepezil-mediated treatment effects were consistent over the decade of enrollment. These analyses suggest that patients are showing slower rates of cognitive decline in more recent trials compared with older trials, although having more comorbidities. This finding may have important potential implications for future clinical trial design."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Roy W","Initials":"RW","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Institute for the Care of Older People, Royal United Hospital, Bath, UK. r.w.jones@bath.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schwam","ForeName":"Elias","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilkinson","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Feldman","ForeName":"Howard H","Initials":"HH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zhang","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Albert","ForeName":"Kenneth","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schindler","ForeName":"Rachel","Initials":"R"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord","NlmUniqueID":"8704771","ISSNLinking":"0893-0341"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Indans"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Piperidines"},{"RegistryNumber":"8SSC91326P","NameOfSubstance":"Donepezil"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Age Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","drug therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["complications","drug therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Comorbidity"},{"DescriptorName":"Donepezil"},{"DescriptorName":"Double-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Indans","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Piperidines","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"6","Day":"30","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"6","Day":"30","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19561444","10.1097\/WAD.0b013e31819cd4be"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19506375","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"10","Day":"05"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2009"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Diagnostic evaluation of dementia in the secondary health care sector.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"534-42"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000223664","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["We conducted a nationwide registry-based study of the quality of diagnostic evaluation for dementia in the secondary health care sector.","Two hundred patients were randomly selected from the patient population (4,682 patients) registered for the first time with a dementia diagnosis in the nationwide hospital registries during the last 6 months of 2003.

Diagnostic research criteria for SIVD are based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings including substantial white matter lesions (WML) and multiple lacunar infarcts. Empirical studies validating these imaging criteria are still few. The purpose of the study was to describe the clinical and cognitive characteristics of the MRI-defined SIVD in a mixed sample of functionally independent elderly subjects with WML.","The subjects of the Leukoaraiosis and Disability (LADIS) study, aged 65-84 years, underwent comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological examinations, and brain MRI at the baseline assessment. The subjects meeting the SIVD imaging criteria (n = 89) were compared to the other subjects of the sample (n = 524).","SIVD was associated with lower education, hypertension and, independently, with obesity. The subjects with SIVD had more often motor impairment, a history of falls, and subtle impairment in activities of daily living, but they did not differ for depressive symptoms. SIVD subjects performed significantly inferiorly in tests of global cognitive function, psychomotor speed, attention and executive functions, verbal fluency, and working memory.","In this population of nondisabled older adults with WML, SIVD was related to specific clinical and functional characteristics. Neuropsychological features included psychomotor slowing as well as deficits in attention and executive functions."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright  2009 S.

trials the patients' own health perception, self-rated health (SRH), measured by a single question, is frequently used as an overall health assessment. Researchers have been encouraged to examine ways of assessing SRH in cognitively impaired persons, but the validity and the influence on other factors on SRH among cognitively impaired persons remain unknown. This study reports how patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) report SRH and which factors influence SRH. The study was based on baseline data from 321 home living patients with mild AD who participated in the Danish Alzheimer Intervention Study (DAISY). Analysis using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) models revealed that good\/excellent SRH among patients with mild AD were associated with longer education, lack of other chronic conditions, higher scores of quality of life (QOL), lower scores of mini mental state examination (MMSE), and loss of insight in own cognitive deficits. The present results indicate that SRH reported by patients with mild AD may differ from SRH among cognitively intact persons. Further research is needed in order to establish the validity and implication of SRH in this group of patients."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldorff","ForeName":"Frans Boch","Initials":"FB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Memory Disorders Research Group, Department of Neurology, Rigshospitalet Copenhagen University Hospital, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. fbw@gpract.ku.dk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nielsen","ForeName":"Anni B S","Initials":"AB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2009","Month":"02","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Arch Gerontol Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"8214379","ISSNLinking":"0167-4943"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Age Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Confidence Intervals"},{"DescriptorName":"Denmark"},{"DescriptorName":"Disability Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Status"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Multivariate Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Odds Ratio"},{"DescriptorName":"Perceptual Disorders","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Probability"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Sex Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Single-Blind Method"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2008","Month":"07","Day":"28"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"12"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"15"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"2","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19181399","S0167-4943(08)00251-3","10.1016\/j.archger.2008.12.010"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18791891","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"01","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Early counselling and support for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers: a qualitative study on outcome.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"444-50"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607860802224342","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The aim of this qualitative study was to identify and analyse the participants' experienced outcome of an intensive structured psychosocial intervention programme with tailored counselling, education and support groups for home-living patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and their spousal caregivers.","Data were collected by semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted separately with each person in 10 couples before the intervention and 1-3 months after completed intervention.

After the intervention, both patients and caregivers sought suitable support groups they could join as a permanent activity and caregivers sought permanent counselling.","Early tailored counselling and support may improve patients' and caregivers' opportunities to adapt to the challenges of Alzheimer's disease and to maintain well-being."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"S\u00f8rensen","ForeName":"Lisbeth V","Initials":"LV","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Memory Disorder Research Group, Neuroscience Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. lisbeth.villemoes.soerensen@rh.hosp.dk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldorff","ForeName":"Frans B","Initials":"FB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Counseling"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"9","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"1","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"9","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18791891","902432170","10.1080\/13607860802224342"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18631976","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"08","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1552-5279","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"4","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association","ISOAbbreviation":"Alzheimers Dement"},"ArticleTitle":"The pilot European Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"255-64"},"ELocationID":"10.1016\/j.jalz.2008.04.009","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["In North America, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has established a platform to track the brain changes of Alzheimer's disease. A pilot study has been carried out in Europe to test the feasibility of the adoption of the ADNI platform (pilot E-ADNI).","Seven academic sites of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC) enrolled 19 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 22 with AD, and 18 older healthy persons by using the ADNI clinical and neuropsychological battery. ADNI compliant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood samples were shipped to central repositories. Medial temporal atrophy (MTA) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were assessed by a single rater by using visual rating scales.","Recruitment rate was 3.5 subjects per month per site. The cognitive, behavioral, and neuropsychological features of the European subjects were very similar to their U.S. counterparts. Three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI sequences were successfully performed on all subjects, and cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained from 77%, 68%, and 83% of AD patients, MCI patients, and controls, respectively. Mean MTA score showed a significant increase from controls (left, right: 0.4, 0.3) to MCI patients (0.9, 0.8) to AD patients (2.3, 2.0), whereas mean WMH score did not differ among the three diagnostic groups (between 0.7 and 0.9). The distribution of both MRI markers was comparable to matched US-ADNI subjects.","Academic EADC centers can adopt the ADNI platform to enroll MCI and AD patients and older controls with global

Here we investigate the capability of protein 14-3-3, total-tau (t-tau), threonin-181-phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) together with the prion protein gene genotype to discriminate patients with sCJD (n=21) from neurological controls (n=164) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (n=49). Low p-tau\/t-tau ratio was the best single marker for sCJD with 90% specificity against neurological controls at 86% sensitivity whilst NSE was the least accurate with 79% sensitivity at 90% specificity. Many of the sCJD patients had extremely elevated t-tau values but normal values of the AD-marker p-tau. Protein 14-3-3 was very sensitive (95%) although the specificity was relatively low (75%). A combination of elevated t-tau concentration with the presence of 14-3-3 protein in CSF gave the best test specificity of 96% at 84% sensitivity. We conclude that the combination of more than one CSF marker for neurodegeneration can improve the diagnostic test accuracy for sCJD against neurological controls including patients with other

We describe atypical phenotypic features in a family with a pathogenic APP gene mutation and discuss possible explanations for these atypical features.","We report a family with a history of dementia compatible with autosomal dominant transmission. The disease course in the proband was not typical for Alzheimer's disease as the diagnosis was preceded by 8 years of an isolated amnesia. Further, the proband had epilepsy with complex partial seizures and central degenerative autonomic failure as determined by clinical physiology. Sequencing the three known causative Alzheimer genes revealed a pathogenic missense mutation, APP Thr714Ala (the Iranian mutation).","The atypical clinical phenotype with long prodromal phase, autonomic failure and seizures in this new proband with the APP Thr714Ala mutation illustrates the clinical heterogeneity in families with identical pathogenic mutations."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lindquist","ForeName":"Suzanne Granh\u00f8j","Initials":"SG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Memory Disorders Research Group, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. suzanne.lindquist@rh.regionh.dk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nielsen","ForeName":"J\u00f8rgen Erik","Initials":"JE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stokholm","ForeName":"Jette","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schwartz","ForeName":"Marianne","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Batbayli","ForeName":"Mustafa","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballegaard","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Erdal","ForeName":"Jesper","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Krabbe","ForeName":"Katja","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Case Reports","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2008","Month":"01","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Neurol Sci","NlmUniqueID":"0375403","ISSNLinking":"0022-510X"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Peptides"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Peptide Fragments"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"amyloid beta-protein (1-42)"},{"RegistryNumber":"2ZD004190S","NameOfSubstance":"Threonine"},{"RegistryNumber":"OF5P57N2ZX","NameOfSubstance":"Alanine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alanine","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["cerebrospinal fluid","genetics","pathology","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Peptides","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"},{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Blood Pressure"},{"DescriptorName":"DNA Mutational Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Electroencephalography"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Iran","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Mutation"},{"DescriptorName":"Peptide Fragments","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"},{"DescriptorName":"Threonine","QualifierName":"genetics"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2007","Month":"09","Day":"28"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2007","Month":"11","Day":"26"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2007","Month":"11","Day":"27"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"1","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"7","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"1","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18187157","S0022-510X(07)00771-X","10.1016\/j.jns.2007.11.021"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18028345","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"01","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1532-5415","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"56","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","ISOAbbreviation":"J Am Geriatr Soc"},"ArticleTitle":"Caries prevalence in older persons with and without dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"59-67"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To examine the prevalence of coronal and root caries in a memory clinic-based population of elderly patients with and without a diagnosis of dementia and to examine the influence of age, sex, social relations, social position, and functional ability.","Cross-sectional.","Patients referred with possible cognitive dysfunction were recruited from two university hospital dementia clinics.","In total, 106 dentate persons participated in the study.

The barriers to care are manifold, being present at all levels in each society and between countries in Europe. Multilevel and multifaceted strategies are needed to improve diagnosis and treatments for all patients with cognitive complaints. A multidisciplinary approach based on close collaboration between GPs and specialised memory clinics may be the ideal model for early accurate diagnosis and subsequently early pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. For all healthcare professionals, there should be specialised training in dementia and frequently updated practice guidelines to provide the framework for standards of care. Culture-sensitive strategies to promote public knowledge and destigmatize dementia are essential.

It was not possible to identify a group of patients that would not benefit from scanning.","Our data support recent guidelines that suggest CT scan as a routine investigation in dementia evaluation."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hasselbalch","ForeName":"Steen G","Initials":"SG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"H:S Rigshospitalet, Neurocentret, H:S Hukommelsesklinikken, Arhus Universitetshospital, Arhus Sygehus. steen.hasselbalch@rh.hosp.dk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gyldensted","ForeName":"Carsten","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"S\u00f8rensen","ForeName":"Leif Houg\u00e5rd","Initials":"LH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Braendgaard","ForeName":"Hans","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Andersen","ForeName":"Kjeld","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lolk","ForeName":"Annette","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kragh-S\u00f8rensen","ForeName":"Per","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"dan","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"VernacularTitle":"Billeddiagnostik ved demensudredning."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Denmark","MedlineTA":"Ugeskr Laeger","NlmUniqueID":"0141730","ISSNLinking":"0041-5782"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cohort Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","diagnostic imaging","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Diagnostic Imaging","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Status Schedule"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Retrospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, X-Ray Computed"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"10","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"10","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"10","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17032607","VP47158"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17032604","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"10","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1603-6824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"168","Issue":"40","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Oct","Day":"02"}},"Title":"Ugeskrift for laeger","ISOAbbreviation":"Ugeskr Laeger"},"ArticleTitle":"[Dementia--genetic aspects].","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"3405-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Several prevalent, sporadic neurodegenerative disorders also occur as rare inherited variants.

Patients with a diagnosis of AD and with an identifiable primary caregiver were eligible for inclusion. Data was collected by questionnaires at baseline, and at scheduled follow-up visits after 6 months and again after 12 months.

Costs for community care (special accommodation, home help, etc.) constituted about half of total costs of care and increase sharply with increasing cognitive impairment. Informal care costs, valued at the opportunity cost of the caregiver's time, make up about a third of total costs and also increased significantly with disease severity. Medical care costs (inpatient care, outpatient care, pharmaceuticals), on the other hand, were not significantly related to disease severity. Regression analysis confirmed a strong association between costs and cognitive function, between patients as well as within patients over time.

Symptomatic treatment now exists which can temporarily inhibit the loss of brain function. Unfortunately, AD is difficult to diagnose, especially early in the disease course, and a definite diagnosis is possible only post-mortem. To develop improved diagnostic methods, several biomarkers have been examined for their ability to differentiate AD from normal aging and other dementias. Their measurement in blood samples has not yet been developed, but analyses may now be routinely performed using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF biomarkers include amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), which is decreased in AD patients, as well as total tau (t-tau) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), which are elevated. While a decreased Abeta1-42 level in CSF has no independent value in the diagnostic differentiation, t-tau and p-tau add more specificity to the differentiation of AD from other dementias while retaining a reasonable degree of sensitivity."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Czarna","ForeName":"Justyna Maria","Initials":"JM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Statens Serum Institut, Autoimmunafdelingen, og H:S Rigshospitalet, Hukommelsesklinikken, Neurologisk Afdeling."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Heegaard","ForeName":"Niels H H","Initials":"NH"}]},"Language":"dan","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article","Review"]},"VernacularTitle":"Biokemiske mark\u00f8rer for Alzheimers sygdom."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Denmark","MedlineTA":"Ugeskr Laeger","NlmUniqueID":"0141730","ISSNLinking":"0041-5782"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Peptides"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Biomarkers"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"tau Proteins"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["cerebrospinal fluid","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Peptides","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"},{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"},{"DescriptorName":"Biomarkers","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebral Cortex","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"},{"DescriptorName":"Diagnosis, Differential"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Sensitivity and Specificity"},{"DescriptorName":"tau Proteins","QualifierName":"cerebrospinal fluid"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"29"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"9","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"9","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16522291","VP46771"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16493236","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"07","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2007","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0893-0341","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2006 Jan-Mar"}},"Title":"Alzheimer disease and associated disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Patient- and proxy-reported utility in Alzheimer disease using the EuroQoL.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"49-55"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This study aims to compare patient- and proxy-rated utilities and health-related quality of life from individuals in different stages of Alzheimer disease (AD).

Average Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were 19.3, 18.0, and 16.4 at the three interviews; scores ranged from 0 to 30. Using the EuroQoL EQ-5D instrument, patient-rated health utilities were on average 0.833 with little variation across MMSE-based severity levels. Proxy-rated health utilities were 0.69 (MMSE >25), 0.64 (MMSE 21-25), 0.50 (MMSE 15-20), 0.49 (MMSE 10-14), and 0.33 (MMSE <10). Proxy-rated utilities, as well as changes in utilities over time, were significantly related to MMSE scores and inversely related to scores on a brief version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and institutionalization. Utilities were highly correlated with the disease-specific quality of life instrument QoL-AD.

These factors are known to contribute to disability in elderly people, but the impact of ARWMC and of their progression on the transition to disability is not determined. The LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability in the Elderly) study aims at assessing the role of ARWMC as an independent predictor of the transition to disability in initially nondisabled elderly (65-84 years). Subjects who are not impaired or impaired on only 1 item of the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) scale, presenting with different grades of ARWMC severity, were enrolled. Eleven European centers are involved. All the patients were assessed at baseline using an extensive set of clinical and functional tests including global functioning, cognitive, motor, psychiatric and quality of life measures. MRI studies were performed at baseline and will be repeated at the end of the follow-up period to evaluate changes of ARWMC and other lesions. ARWMC were categorized into mild, moderate or severe using the scale of Fazekas et al. For each ARWMC severity class, the primary study outcome is the transition to disability defined as an impairment on 2 or more IADL scale items. Secondary outcomes are the occurrence of dementia, depression, vascular events or death. Six-hundred and thirty-nine subjects (mean age 74.13 +\/- 5.0 years, M\/F: 288\/351) were enrolled in a hospital-based setting and are being followed up for up to 3 years. The large and comprehensive set of measures in LADIS enables a comprehensive description of their functional and clinical features to be examined in relation to different morphological patterns and severity of ARWMC. The longitudinal design will give insight into the possible role of ARWMC and their progression as an independent contributor to disability in the elderly, eventually helping to develop preventive strategies to reduce the burden of disability in late life. The study results may also help to standardize, on an international basis, tools and criteria to identify early stages of disability."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pantoni","ForeName":"Leonardo","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurological and Psychiatric Sciences, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. pantoni@neuro.unifi.it"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Basile","ForeName":"Anna Maria","Initials":"AM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pracucci","ForeName":"Giovanni","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Asplund","ForeName":"Kjell","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bogousslavsky","ForeName":"Julien","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chabriat","ForeName":"Hugues","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Erkinjuntti","ForeName":"Timo","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fazekas","ForeName":"Franz","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ferro","ForeName":"Jos\u00e9 M","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hennerici","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'brien","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scheltens","ForeName":"Philip","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Visser","ForeName":"Marieke C","Initials":"MC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wahlund","ForeName":"Lars-Olof","Initials":"LO"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wallin","ForeName":"Anders","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Inzitari","ForeName":"Domenico","Initials":"D"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Switzerland","MedlineTA":"Neuroepidemiology","NlmUniqueID":"8218700","ISSNLinking":"0251-5350"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":["pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cardiovascular Diseases","QualifierName":["epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Disability Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Epidemiologic Methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Motor Activity","QualifierName":"physiology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"10","Day":"2","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"1","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"10","Day":"2","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15459510","10.1159\/000081050","81050"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15212829","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"10","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0197-4580","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"25","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Neurobiology of aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Neurobiol Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"Prepulse inhibition in patients with Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1045-50"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is used as a measure for sensorimotor gating.

The objectives of this study were to determine if patients with very mild AD had altered PPI, and to study possible correlations between PPI and cognitive performance or neuropsychiatric symptoms. A passive acoustic PPI paradigm was applied in 48 patients with either mild AD or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and in 49 healthy controls. No differences were found between patients and healthy controls regarding PPI. Further, PPI was not found to correlate with cognitive performance or neuropsychiatric symptoms. PPI is significantly altered in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders associated with dopaminergic, glutamatergic and\/or serotonergic dysfunctions, such as schizophrenia. Since mild AD is primarily associated with loss of cholinergic markers in the limbic regions this study suggests that acetylcholine only plays a minor role in the regulation of PPI."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hejl","ForeName":"Anne-Mette","Initials":"AM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Memory Disorders Research Unit, The Neuroscience Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark. hejl@inet.uni2.dk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Glenth\u00f8j","ForeName":"Birte","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mackeprang","ForeName":"Torben","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hemmingsen","ForeName":"Ralf","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Neurobiol Aging","NlmUniqueID":"8100437","ISSNLinking":"0197-4580"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"N9YNS0M02X","NameOfSubstance":"Acetylcholine"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Acetylcholine","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Acoustic Stimulation"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Entorhinal Cortex","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Habituation, Psychophysiologic","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Hippocampus","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neural Inhibition","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Predictive Value of Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Reaction Time","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Reflex, Startle","QualifierName":"physiology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2003","Month":"04","Day":"07"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"04"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"6","Day":"24","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"10","Day":"5","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"6","Day":"24","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15212829","10.1016\/j.neurobiolaging.2003.11.005","S0197458003002355"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"14739542","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"05","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1420-8008","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2004"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Awareness of deficits in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: do MCI patients have impaired insight?","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"181-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"In this study we investigated impaired awareness of cognitive deficits in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

All four patients had a rapidly progressive course and have become mute and non-ambulatory, and three have died after mean illness duration of only 3 years (range 2 1\/2 -4). Both structural (MRI) and functional (PET and SPECT) imaging demonstrated frontal and temporal lobe and basal ganglia involvement. Gross neuropathological examination in the three deceased patients (the fourth patient, still alive, was diagnosed by brain biopsy) revealed changes affecting predominantly the frontal and temporal cortices, basal ganglia and brainstem. There was superficial linear spongiosis affecting the frontal lobes in all three autopsied patients, and severe caudate atrophy was noted in two of them and demonstrated on MRI in the living patient. On routine staining, there were numerous intracytoplasmic inclusions, which ranged from eosinophilic to basophilic. Some had a clearly defined basophilic margin, while others were granular with a hyaline core. With modified Bielschowsky silver technique, a small number of the inclusions were intensely stained. Inclusions were not labelled with other silver stains. Immuno histochemistry revealed that the inclusions were immunoreactive with antibodies to neurofilament heavy and light chain subunits and to ubiquitin, but not with antibodies to tau and alpha-synuclein. These neurofilament- and ubiquitin-positive inclusions were widespread, specific to neurons and occasionally intranuclear. The frequency and distribution of the inclusions and the silver and immunohistochemical profiles in these four cases is novel and has not been described in detail before.

Patients received either donepezil (n = 142; 5 mg\/day for 28 days followed by 10 mg\/day according to the clinician's judgement) or placebo (n = 144). Unit costs were assessed in 1999 Swedish kronas (SEK) and converted to US dollars (USD). Donepezil-treated patients gained functional benefits relative to placebo on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (p = 0.042) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (p = 0.025) at week 52. Caregivers of donepezil-treated patients spent an average of 400 h less annually providing care than caregivers of placebo-treated patients. Mean annual healthcare costs were SEK 137,752 (USD 16,438) per patient for the donepezil group and SEK 135,314 (USD 16,147) in the placebo group. With the average annual cost of donepezil at SEK 10,723 (USD 1,280) per patient, the SEK 2,438 (USD 291) cost difference represented a 77% cost offset. When caregiver time and healthcare costs were included, mean annual costs were SEK 209,244 (USD 24,969) per patient in the donepezil group and SEK 218,434 (USD 26,066) in the placebo group, a total saving associated with donepezil treatment of SEK 9,190 (USD 1,097) per patient [95% CI of SEK -43,959 (USD -5,246), SEK 25,581 (USD 3,053); p = 0.6]. The positive effects on the efficacy outcome measures combined with no additional costs from a societal perspective indicate that donepezil is a cost-effective treatment, representing an improved strategy for the management of patients with AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2003 S.
