The effects of SettleIN on resident adjustment, mood and quality of life were also investigated. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted. Nineteen new residents with dementia and 21 staff participants were recruited. Residents were randomly assigned to receive the SettleIN programme or residential care as usual. Resident quality of life, mood and overall adjustment were measured at baseline and post-intervention, in week seven. Interviews were conducted with staff in week seven to explore intervention feasibility. Despite medium to large effect sizes, there was no significant difference in mean change scores between the two conditions, with regards to quality of life, psychological wellbeing or overall adjustment outcomes. Qualitative feedback indicated that SettleIN was not feasible across all areas, with problems around recruitment and practicality. However, SettleIN was deemed feasible in terms of retention and acceptability among staff. The majority of staff felt that SettleIN was beneficial for residents but that organisational and programme factors impacted upon intervention feasibility. Further exploration of organisational barriers is needed in order to reduce the impact of such factors on care home

which intervention components were delivered and whether they were delivered as planned (fidelity of delivery). These studies aimed to develop a reliable measure for assessing fidelity of delivery of the Community Occupational Therapy in Dementia-UK intervention (COTiD-UK) (Study 1) and measure fidelity of delivery of COTiD-UK across sessions, sites and occupational therapists (Study 2).","The studies used a longitudinal observational design nested within a multi-site randomised controlled trial. Where practicable, all intervention sessions were audio-recorded. Fidelity checklists and coding guidelines were developed, piloted and refined until good agreement was achieved between two coders. Ten percent of sessions were purposively sampled from 12 sites and 31 occupational therapists. Transcripts were coded using checklists developed in Study 1; 10% of sets of intervention session transcripts were double coded to ensure that agreement was maintained. Percentages of components that were delivered were calculated for each session, site and occupational therapist.","A reliable measure of fidelity of delivery for COTiD-UK was developed after several rounds of piloting and amendments. COTiD-UK was delivered with moderate fidelity across all six sessions (range: 52.4-75.5%). The mean range of fidelity varied across sites (26.7-91.2%) and occupational therapists (26.7-94.1%).","A reliable, systematic method for measuring fidelity of delivery of COTiD-UK was developed and applied, and can be adapted for use in similar interventions. As COTiD-UK was delivered with moderate fidelity, there is a reasonable degree of confidence that intervention effects were attributable to COTiD-UK."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Walton","ForeName":"Holly","Initials":"H","Identifier":"0000-0002-8746-059X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

interventions are delivered as planned (with fidelity) and engaged with. To measure fidelity and engagement effectively, high-quality measures are needed. We outline a five-step method which can be used to develop quality measures of fidelity and engagement for complex health interventions. We provide examples from a fidelity study conducted within an evaluation of an intervention aimed to increase independence in dementia.","We propose five steps that can be systematically used to develop fidelity checklists for researchers, providers, and participants to measure fidelity and engagement. These steps include the following: (1) reviewing previous measures, (2) analysing intervention components and developing a framework outlining the content of the intervention, (3) developing fidelity checklists and coding guidelines, (4) obtaining feedback about the content and wording of checklists and guidelines, and (5) piloting and refining checklists and coding guidelines to assess and improve reliability.","Three fidelity checklists that can be used reliably were developed to measure fidelity of and engagement with, the Promoting Independence in Dementia (PRIDE) intervention. As these measures were designed to be used by researchers, providers, and participants, we developed two versions of the checklists: one for participants and one for researchers and providers.","The five steps that we propose can be used to develop psychometrically robust and implementable measures of fidelity and engagement for complex health interventions that can be used by different target audiences. By considering quality when developing measures, we can be more confident in the interpretation of intervention outcomes drawn from fidelity and engagement studies. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? Fidelity and engagement can be measured using a range of methods, such as observation and self-report. Studies seldom report psychometric and implementation qualities of fidelity measures. What does this study add? A method for developing fidelity and engagement measures for complex health interventions.

management of symptoms. The aim of the Promoting Independence in Dementia (PRIDE) study was to develop a postdiagnostic social intervention to help people live as well and as independently as possible. The intervention facilitates engagement in evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical and social activities.","Theories to promote adjustment to a dementia diagnosis, including theories of social learning and self-efficacy, were reviewed alongside self-management and the selective optimization model, to form the basis of the intervention. Analyses of two longitudinal databases of older adults, and qualitative analyses of interviews of older people, people with dementia, and their carers about their experiences of dementia, informed the content and focus of the intervention. Consensus expert review involving stakeholders was conducted to synthesize key components. Participants were sourced from the British NHS, voluntary services, and patient and public involvement groups. A tailored manual-based intervention was developed with the aim for this to be delivered by an intervention provider.","Evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical, and social activities that have been shown to benefit people were key components of the proposed PRIDE intervention. Thirty-two participants including people with dementia (n=4), carers (n=11), dementia advisers (n=14), and older people (n=3) provided feedback on the drafts of the intervention and manual. Seven topics for activities were included (eg, \"making decisions\" and \"getting your message across\"). The manual outlines delivery of the intervention over three sessions where personalized profiles and plans for up to three activities are developed, implemented, and reviewed.","A manualized intervention was constructed based on robust methodology and found to be acceptable to participants. Consultations with stakeholders played a key role in shaping the manualized PRIDE intervention and its delivery. Unlike most social interventions for dementia, the target audience for our intervention is the people with dementia themselves."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 Yates et

(LMICs), the prevalence of people diagnosed with dementia is expected to increase substantially and treatment options are limited, with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors not used as frequently as in high-income countries (HICs). Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a group-based, brief, non-pharmacological intervention for people with dementia that significantly improves cognition and quality of life in clinical trials and is cost-effective in HIC. However, its implementation in other countries is less researched. This protocol describes CST-International; an implementation research study of CST. The aim of this research is to develop, test, refine and disseminate implementation strategies for CST for people with mild to moderate dementia in three LMICs: Brazil (upper middle-income), India (lower middle-income) and Tanzania (low-income).","Four overlapping phases: (1) exploration of barriers to implementation in each country using meetings with stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, people with dementia and their families; (2) development of implementation plans for each country; (3) evaluation of implementation plans using a study of CST in each country (n=50, total n=150). Outcomes will include adherence, attendance, acceptability and attrition, agreed parameters of success, outcomes (cognition, quality of life, activities of daily living) and cost\/affordability; (4) refinement and dissemination of implementation strategies, enabling ongoing pathways to practice which address barriers and facilitators to implementation.","Ethical approval has been granted for each country. There are no documented adverse effects associated with CST and data held will be in accordance with relevant legislation. Train the trainer models will be developed to increase CST provision in each country and policymakers\/governmental bodies will be continually engaged with to aid successful implementation. Findings will be disseminated at conferences, in peer-reviewed articles and newsletters, in collaboration with Alzheimer's Disease International, and via ongoing engagement with key policymakers."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

language-led dementias. People with this type of dementia are increasingly being referred to speech and language therapy (SLT) services. Yet, there is a paucity of research evidence focusing on PPA interventions and little is known about SLT practice in terms of assessment and provision of intervention.","To survey the practices of SLTs in the areas of assessment and intervention for people with PPA.","A 37-item, pilot-tested survey was distributed electronically through the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), Clinical Excellence Networks (CENs) and social media networks. Survey items included questions on care pathways, assessment and intervention approaches, and future planning. Analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.","A total of 105 SLTs completed the survey. Respondents reported more frequently using formal assessment tools designed for stroke-related aphasia than for dementia. Informal interviews were reportedly always used during assessment by almost 80% of respondents. Respondents were significantly more likely to use communication partner training than impairment-focused interventions. Goal attainment was the most commonly used outcome measure. Respondents provided 88 goal examples, which fell into six themes: communication aid; conversation; functional communication; impairment focused; specific strategy; and communication partner. Additionally, respondents reported addressing areas such as future deterioration in communication and cognition, decision-making and mental capacity, and driving.

Group CST is effective in reducing cognitive decline and improving quality of life in patients with dementia. There is some evidence that individual CST (iCST) may be beneficial in reducing cognitive decline. People with intellectual disability (ID) have an increased risk of dementia. However, there are no published studies of CST in people with ID and dementia. This protocol describes the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of iCST delivered by carers to people with ID and dementia, compared with treatment as usual (TAU). The results of this study will inform the design of a future definitive randomised controlled trial.","The iCST intervention has been adapted for this trial. Forty dyads (individuals with ID and their carer) will be randomised to either iCST or TAU. The manualised intervention comprises 40 iCST sessions delivered by a carer for 30\u2009min, twice a week, over 20\u2009weeks. The primary outcome will be process measures assessing the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial procedures. The secondary outcome will be changes in the scores of outcome measures (cognition, functional ability and quality of life in individuals with ID, and caregiver burden, competence in managing dementia, and anxiety and depression in carers). Data will be collected at baseline, 11\u2009weeks and at 21\u2009weeks. A process evaluation will examine adherence to iCST and will include qualitative interviews with participants to identify aspects of the intervention that were or were not successful.","The study has received ethical approval. The results of the study will be presented at conferences and submitted to a peer reviewed journal.","ISRCTN18312288; Pre-results."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

It involves discussion of past events and experiences, using tangible prompts to evoke memories or stimulate conversation. Areas covered: The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of RT for people with dementia. It includes studies from the specialized register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS). Searches yielded 185 records of which 22 (n\u00a0=\u00a01972) were eligible for inclusion. The meta-analysis comprised of data from 16 studies (n\u00a0=\u00a01749 participants). The review included four large multicenter high-quality studies and several smaller studies of reasonable quality. Outcomes of interest were quality of life, communication, depression, and cognition at posttreatment and later follow-up. Expert commentary: RT has the potential to improve psychosocial outcomes for people with dementia. Effects are small and can be inconsistent, varying across intervention modality and setting. Individual approaches were associated with improved cognition and mood. Group approaches were linked to improved communication. The impact on quality of life appeared most promising in care home settings. Diversity in reminiscence approaches makes it difficult to compare them, and the field would benefit from the development, evaluation, use, and sharing of standardized approaches."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O' Philbin","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , Bangor University , Bangor , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , Bangor University , Bangor , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Farrell","ForeName":"Emma M","Initials":"EM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , Bangor University , Bangor , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spector","ForeName":"Aimee E","Initials":"AE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology , University College London , London , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c Institute of Mental Health , University of Nottingham , Nottingham , UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"08","Day":"28"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Expert Rev Neurother","NlmUniqueID":"101129944","ISSNLinking":"1473-7175"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s","Reminiscence therapy","dementia","life review","non-pharmacological","psychosocial"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"8","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"5","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"8","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30092689","10.1080\/14737175.2018.1509709"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29717527","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"33","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"06"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Cultural adaptation of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) for Chinese people with dementia: multicentre pilot study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"841-848"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.4663","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Ageing of the Chinese population will drive a continued surge in dementia prevalence. Empirically tested non-pharmacological interventions developed in western cultures may be implemented in Chinese. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) that originated in the UK has proven benefits on cognition and quality of life in people with dementia. We investigated the feasibility and cultural appropriateness of CST in Hong Kong Chinese (CST-HK).","Mixed methods research was conducted following the formative method for adapting psychotherapy. A culturally adapted CST-HK, developed involving multidisciplinary stakeholders, was tested in a pilot multicentre study in people with mild dementia (n\u2009=\u200930) receiving community or residential care. Changes in cognition and quality of life were measured. Opinions from family caregivers and group facilitators (n\u2009=\u200925) were collected through focus groups and in-depth interviews for understanding the appropriateness of CST-HK. Feasibility was explored.","After receiving CST-HK, 54% of participants achieved outcome of no cognitive deterioration, and 23% showed clinically meaningful improvement. Family caregivers and group facilitators expressed good acceptance of CST, with a low attrition (13%) and high attendance rate of CST-HK sessions (92%). Key cultural issues identified are (i) less active opinion sharing in group discussions due to conservatism\/cautiousness and (ii) preference of practical activities with reward\/recognition over pure discussion due to pragmatism.","The CST-HK is feasible and culturally appropriate in Hong Kong Chinese. Further amendments can be made to ensure language use and enjoyment, with potential implications on effectiveness.

RT involves the discussion of memories and past experiences with other people using tangible prompts such as photographs or music to evoke memories and stimulate conversation. RT is implemented widely in a range of settings using a variety of formats.","To assess the effects of RT on people living with dementia and their carers, taking into account differences in its implementation, including setting (care home, community) and modality (group, individual).","We searched ALOIS (the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register) on 6 April 2017 using the search term 'reminiscence.'","We included all randomised controlled trials of RT for dementia in which the duration of the intervention was at least four weeks (or six sessions) and that had a 'no treatment' or passive control group. Outcomes of interest were quality of life (QoL), cognition, communication, behaviour, mood and carer outcomes.","Two authors (LOP and EF) independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Where necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled data from all sufficiently similar studies reporting on each outcome. We undertook subgroup analysis by setting (community versus care home) and by modality (individual versus group). We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome.","We included 22 studies involving 1972 people with dementia. Meta-analyses included data from 16 studies (1749 participants). Apart from six studies with risk of selection bias, the overall risk of bias in the studies was low.Overall, moderate quality evidence indicated RT did not have an important effect on QoL immediately after the intervention period compared with no treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to 0.33; I = 59%; 8 studies; 1060 participants). Inconsistency between studies mainly related to the study setting. There was probably a slight benefit in favour of RT in care homes post-treatment (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.75; 3 studies; 193 participants), but little or no difference in QoL in community settings (867 participants from five studies).For cognitive measures, there was high quality evidence for a very small benefit, of doubtful clinical importance, associated with reminiscence at the end of treatment (SMD 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23; 14 studies; 1219 participants), but little or no difference at longer-term follow-up. There was a probable slight improvement for individual reminiscence and for care homes when analysed separately, but little or no difference for community settings or for group studies. Nine studies included the widely used Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a cognitive measure, and, on this scale, there was high quality evidence for an improvement at the end of treatment (mean difference (MD) 1.87 points, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.20; 437 participants). There was a similar effect at longer-term follow-up, but the quality of evidence for this analysis was low (1.8 points, 95% CI -0.06 to 3.65).For communication measures, there may have been a benefit of RT at the end of treatment (SMD -0.51 points, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.05; I = 62%; negative scores indicated improvement; 6 studies; 249 participants), but there was inconsistency between studies, related to the RT modality. At follow-up, there was probably a slight benefit of RT (SMD -0.49 points, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.21; 4 studies; 204 participants). Effects were uncertain for individual RT, with very low quality evidence available. For reminiscence groups, evidence of moderate quality indicated a probable slight benefit immediately (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.06; 4 studies; 153 participants), and at later follow-up. Community participants probably benefited at end of treatment and follow-up. For care home participants, the results were inconsistent between studies and, while there may be an improvement at follow-up, at the end of treatment the evidence quality was very low and effects were uncertain.Other outcome domains examined for people with dementia included mood, functioning in daily activities, agitation\/irritability and relationship quality. There were no clear effects in these domains. Individual reminiscence was probably associated with a slight benefit on depression scales, although its clinical importance was uncertain (SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.06; 4 studies; 131 participants). We found no evidence of any harmful effects on people with dementia.We also looked at outcomes for carers, including stress, mood and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (from the carer's perspective). We found no evidence of effects on carers other than a potential adverse outcome related to carer anxiety at longer-term follow-up, based on two studies that had involved the carer jointly in reminiscence groups with people with dementia. The control group carers were probably slightly less anxious (MD 0.56 points, 95% CI -0.17 to 1.30; 464 participants), but this result is of uncertain clinical importance, and is also consistent with little or no effect.","The effects of reminiscence interventions are inconsistent, often small in size and can differ considerably across settings and modalities. RT has some positive effects on people with dementia in the domains of QoL, cognition, communication and mood. Care home studies show the widest range of benefits, including QoL, cognition and communication (at follow-up). Individual RT is associated with probable benefits for cognition and mood. Group RT and a community setting are associated with probable improvements in communication. The wide range of RT interventions across studies makes comparisons and evaluation of relative benefits difficult. Treatment protocols are not described in sufficient detail in many publications. There have been welcome improvements in the quality of research on RT since the previous version of this review, although there still remains a need for more randomised controlled trials following clear, detailed treatment protocols, especially allowing the effects of simple and integrative RT to be compared."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia

need to also assess the strengths and capabilities that people with dementia retain, rather than assessing only losses or deficits. The CASP-19 proposes wellbeing as the satisfaction of four 'needs' (control, autonomy, self-realisation and pleasure). The CASP-19 may reflect the asses-based approach and has been validated in over 20 countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CASP-19's psychometric properties in older adults with dementia.","An observational study was conducted at five NHS trusts across England. Participants were asked to either complete the CASP-19 by interview or self-report, alongside four other measures to assess psychometric properties.","Internal consistency overall was good (\u03b1 = .856) but the autonomy subscale fell below the acceptable. The CASP-19 was significantly correlated in the expected direction with measures of quality of life (r = .707), depression (r = -.707) and additional measures. It also remained moderately stable over a one-week period but factor analyses indicated a 12-item measure may be more robust.","Despite some variations, the CASP-19 appears to have adequate psychometric properties for older adults with dementia and can be used in future research and practice."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stoner","ForeName":"Charlotte R","Initials":"CR","Identifier":"0000-0002-1536-4347","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases , Institute of Neurology , University College London , London , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Institute of Mental Health , University of Nottingham , Nottingham , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spector","ForeName":"Aimee","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology , University College London , London , UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Observational Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"22"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Personal Autonomy"},{"DescriptorName":"Personal Satisfaction"},{"DescriptorName":"Pleasure"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Self-Control","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer's","CASP-19","dementia","outcome measurement","positive psychology","psychometric","quality of life","reliability","validity","wellbeing"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"7","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29356567","10.1080\/13607863.2018.1428940"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29338323","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"23","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"04"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Psychosocial interventions for people with dementia: a synthesis of systematic reviews.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"393-403"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2017.1423031","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Over the last 10\u00a0years there has been a multitude of studies of psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. However, clinical services face a dilemma about which intervention should be introduced into clinical practice because of the inconsistency in some of the findings between different studies and the differences in the study qualities and trustworthiness of evidence. There was a need to provide a comprehensive summary of the best evidence to illustrate what works.","A review of the systematic reviews of psychosocial interventions in dementia published between January 2010 and February 2016 was conducted.","Twenty-two reviews (8 physical, 7 cognitive, 1 physical\/cognitive and 6 other psychosocial interventions) with a total of 197 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. Both medium to longer-term multi-component exercise of moderate to high intensity, and, group cognitive stimulation consistently show benefits. There is not sufficient evidence to determine whether psychological or social interventions might improve either mood or behaviour due to the heterogeneity of the studies and interventions included in the reviews.","There is good evidence that multi-component exercise with sufficient intensity improves global physical and cognitive functions and activities of daily living skills. There is also good evidence that group-based cognitive stimulation improves cognitive functions, social interaction and quality of life. This synthesis also highlights the potential importance of group activities to improve social integration for people with dementia. Future research should investigate longer-term specific outcomes, consider the severity and types of dementia, and investigate mechanisms of change."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McDermott","ForeName":"Orii","Initials":"O","Identifier":"0000-0003-4685-3490","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology , University of Nottingham , Nottingham , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charlesworth","ForeName":"Georgina","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Division of Psychology and Language Sciences , University College London , London , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hogervorst","ForeName":"Eef","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences , Loughborough University , Loughborough , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stoner","ForeName":"Charlotte","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0002-1536-4347","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"d Department of Neurodegenerative Disease , Institute of Neurology, University College London , London , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moniz-Cook","ForeName":"Esme","Initials":"E","Identifier":"0000-0002-7232-4632","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"e Faculty of Health\u00a0 Sciences , University of Hull , Hull , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spector","ForeName":"Aimee","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Division of Psychology and Language Sciences , University College London , London , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Csipke","ForeName":"Emese","Initials":"E","Identifier":"0000-0003-0911-9262","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"f Division of Psychiatry , University College London , London , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology , University of Nottingham , Nottingham , United Kingdom."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"17"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Exercise Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Systematic Reviews as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","evidence synthesis","psychosocial intervention","systematic review"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"7","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29338323","10.1080\/13607863.2017.1423031"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29145739","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"01","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"01","Day":"17"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"08"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"The development of positive psychology outcome measures and their uses in dementia research: A systematic review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2085-2106"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301217740288","AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stoner","ForeName":"Charlotte R","Initials":"CR","Identifier":"0000-0002-1536-4347","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stansfeld","ForeName":"Jacki","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research and Development, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, Ilford, UK;

There is evidence that home-based programmes of cognitive stimulation delivered by family caregivers may benefit both the person and the caregiver. However, no previous studies have evaluated caregiver-delivered CST. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based, caregiver-led individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) program in (i) improving cognition and quality of life (QoL) for the person with dementia and (ii) mental and physical health (well-being) for the caregiver.","A single-blind, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at eight study sites across the United Kingdom. The intervention and blinded assessment of outcomes were conducted in participants' homes. Three hundred fifty-six people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were recruited from memory services and community mental health teams (CMHTs). Participants were randomly assigned to iCST (75, 30-min sessions) or treatment as usual (TAU) control over 25 wk. iCST sessions consisted of themed activities designed to be mentally stimulating and enjoyable. Caregivers delivering iCST received training and support from an unblind researcher. Primary outcomes were cognition (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive [ADAS-Cog]) and self-reported QoL (Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease [QoL-AD]) for the person with dementia and general health status (Short Form-12 health survey [SF-12]) for the caregiver. Secondary outcomes included quality of the caregiving relationship from the perspectives of the person and of the caregiver (Quality of the Carer Patient Relationship Scale) and health-related QoL (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions [EQ-5D]) for the caregiver. Intention to treat (ITT) analyses were conducted. At the post-test (26 wk), there were no differences between the iCST and TAU groups in the outcomes of cognition (mean difference [MD] = -0.55, 95% CI -2.00-0.90; p = 0.45) and self-reported QoL (MD = -0.02, 95% CI -1.22-0.82; p = 0.97) for people with dementia, or caregivers' general health status (MD = 0.13, 95% CI -1.65-1.91; p = 0.89). However, people with dementia receiving iCST rated the relationship with their caregiver more positively (MD = 1.77, 95% CI 0.26-3.28; p = 0.02), and iCST improved QoL for caregivers (EQ-5D, MD = 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.10; p = 0.01). Forty percent (72\/180) of dyads allocated to iCST completed at least two sessions per week, with 22% (39\/180) completing no sessions at all. Study limitations include low adherence to the intervention.","There was no evidence that iCST has an effect on cognition or QoL for people with dementia. However, participating in iCST appeared to enhance the quality of the caregiving relationship and caregivers' QoL.","The iCST trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (identified ISRCTN 65945963,

qualitative literature because of the lack of robust outcome measures. The aim of this study was to develop positive psychology outcome measures for people with dementia.","Two measures were each developed in four stages. Firstly, literature reviews were conducted to identify and operationalise salient positive psychology themes in the qualitative literature and to examine existing measures of positive psychology. Secondly, themes were discussed within a qualitative study to add content validity for identified concepts (n\u2009=\u200917). Thirdly, draft measures were submitted to a panel of experts for feedback (n\u2009=\u20096). Finally, measures were used in a small-scale pilot study (n\u2009=\u200933) to establish psychometric properties.","Salient positive psychology themes were identified as hope, resilience, a sense of independence and social engagement. Existing measures of hope and resilience were adapted to form the Positive Psychology Outcome Measure (PPOM). Due to the inter-relatedness of independence and engagement for people with dementia, 28 items were developed for a new scale of Engagement and Independence in Dementia Questionnaire (EID-Q) following extensive qualitative work. Both measures demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.849 and \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.907 respectively) and convergent validity.","Two new positive psychology outcome measures were developed using a robust four-stage procedure. Preliminary psychometric data was adequate and the measures were easy to use, and acceptable for people with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stoner","ForeName":"Charlotte

Nineteen studies were included and appraised using a quality rating tool.","Overall, the studies were found to be of variable quality; however, 16 studies found a significant change following training in at least one staff domain, with knowledge improving most frequently. Approaches focusing on managing challenging behaviours appeared to be the most effective.","Training staff can be an effective method of improving well-being, and programmes helping staff to manage challenging behaviour appear to be the most beneficial. There is no clear relationship between training intensity and outcome. Most studies point to the importance of addressing organisational factors as a barrier to change.

However, groups may not be accessible or best suited for all. Individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST) has been developed to provide another means of accessing CST.","The programme was field tested by 22 dyads (carers and people with dementia). Dyads were trained in the iCST approach and provided with a manual and accompanying resources. Researchers contacted dyads weekly to provide support and gather adherence data. Quantitative feedback about each session was also collected using 'Monitoring Progress' forms. Upon completion of their allocation sessions, researchers interviewed dyads about their experience. In total, nine dyads were followed up. Inductive thematic analysis was performed on the qualitative data. The aims of field testing were to assess the feasibility of the programme, and the appropriateness of the iCST materials.","Sixty-two percent of the themes received an overall 'high' rating, and the majority of activities were classed as 'low' difficulty. Common barriers to completing sessions were; lack of time, illness, and motivation. Carers felt the manual and resources were 'good' and easy to use. Benefits of the programme for the person included; improvements in communication, mood, and alertness. The programme also gave carers insight into the person's abilities and interests, and provided a new channel of communication. Little support was needed to deliver the programme.","Implementation of the iCST intervention was feasible. However, the majority of dyads completed fewer than three sessions per week. The training and support package appeared to be suitable as carers were able to deliver the intervention without intensive support. Barriers occurred largely as a result of life commitments, rather than problems with the intervention itself. This study was limited by a high loss to follow up rate. The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of iCST were investigated in a large scale randomised controlled trial (RCT).","ISRCTN65945963 Date of trial registration:

well-validated, self-report measure of both anxiety and depression. It is frequently used with people with dementia. However, its structural validity has never been examined in this population. The current study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess this.","Baseline data from two intervention studies for people with mild to moderate dementia were combined (N\u2009=\u2009268). CFA was used to test whether a one, two or three factor structure best fit the data. Indices of model misspecification were examined to test for poor quality items, and models re-specified accordingly. Finally, measurement invariance across gender and different levels of cognitive impairment was assessed.","A one-factor structure did not fit the data. Two and three factor structures fitted the data equally well. Model fit was improved by removal of two items. Measurement invariance was adequate across gender, but poor across groups with differing levels of cognitive impairment.","The HADS is acceptable and feasible but difficult to interpret in a dementia population. We suggest that it should be interpreted as measuring two separate factors of anxiety and depression and not one 'distress' factor. However, two items may need to be removed, affecting cut-off scores. Poor measurement invariance means the HADS may not be a good tool for measuring differences in anxiety and depression between those with mild and those with moderate cognitive impairment.

The aim of this current study was to determine (1) which factors are associated with the quality of the patient-carer relationship and (2) whether these differ between the two perspectives.","Participants (people with dementia and their carers) were taken from a randomised controlled trial of cognitive behaviour therapy for anxiety in dementia. The quality of the relationship from both perspectives, anxiety and depression in both parties; and the quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning in people with dementia was examined at three time points (baseline, 15 weeks and 6 months).","There were 127 observations from 50 dyads (100 individuals) across the three time points. Factors significantly related to quality of relationship from the person with dementia's perspective were their own aggression, agitation, irritability, depression, anxiety and quality of life.

robust theoretical, empirical, and clinical rationales represents best practice. The Medical Research Council (MRC) provides a framework for a systematic step-wise approach to the evaluation of complex interventions. This study describes the development phase of the individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) for dementia trial, within this framework.","In the preclinical phase, a recent Cochrane Review of cognitive stimulation for dementia and the current literature on individual cognitive stimulation interventions were examined to establish an evidence base. In addition, people with dementia, carers, and care staff were consulted regarding the acceptability of iCST, and a panel was put together to advise the team on the adaptation of group cognitive stimulation therapy (CST). Phase I (modeling) involved consultations with service users and experts in a series of focus groups, interviews, an online survey, and a consensus conference. Finally, Phase II field testing of the intervention was carried out.","Two drafts of the materials were produced before a final version ready for use in the main randomized controlled trial (RCT). Key changes between the drafts included: editorial amendments to improve the clarity of instructions, emphasize the person centeredness of the approach, and reduce the overall length of the introduction section; the simplification of academic terminology and activities deemed \"too difficult\"; adjustments made to the monitoring-progress forms and session rating scale to enhance user-friendliness; the addition of a \"Getting started\" section; amendments made to the content of the toolkit; and clearer distinction made between the level of difficulty of activities.","The rigorous development of the intervention was beneficial as the feasibility of the intervention was explored both in theory and practice, and consulting with service users ensured that materials were appropriately tailored to their needs. A Phase III RCT is currently being conducted to determine the effectiveness of iCST."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Yates","ForeName":"Lauren A","Initials":"LA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"North East

is a widely used, evidence-based intervention for people with dementia (PwD). Although designed as a 14 session, twice weekly intervention, many services in the UK deliver CST once a week for 14 weeks. However, this method of delivery has yet to be evaluated. In addition, CST does not include any formal carer training. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of once weekly CST and determine any additional impact when enhanced with a carer training program.","A single blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Sixty eight PwD and their carers were recruited through three community Memory Assessment Services. PwD and their carers were randomized to one of three conditions: CST plus carer training, CST only, or a wait list control. PwD were administered standardized measures of cognition, quality of life, and quality of relationship with carer at baseline and the 15 week follow-up.","There were no baseline differences across the three groups. At follow-up, there were no significant differences between PwD in the three groups on any outcomes.","Weekly CST with or without carer training may not be an effective form of delivery. Several possible explanations for the outcomes are proposed. Weekly CST may not offer the necessary \"dose\" required to combat decline, and equally the carer training may have been too brief to have made a difference.

randomized controlled trial with people with anxiety and mild-to-moderate dementia. The aim of the therapy is to reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing a sense of safety and self-efficacy. The therapy is characterized by a person-centered approach to CBT, using individual tailoring to accommodate for cognitive deficits and other challenges. Three phases of therapy are described: (a) socialization to model (including overcoming barriers to participation), goal setting, and formulation; (b) application of cognitive and behavioral change techniques to address unhelpful autonomic reactions, \"strategic\" reactions, \"rules for living,\" and interpersonal aspects; and (c) consolidation and ending in the context of chronic, deteriorating illness. The approach prioritizes direct work with the person with dementia, with the involvement of a \"supportive other\" where available and when necessary.

It is increasing in popularity in the UK and worldwide, and a number of research teams have examined its effectiveness in other contexts and cultures. However, it is necessary to develop clear evidence-based guidelines for cultural modification of the intervention. This article describes a community-based developmental approach to adapt CST to different cultures, following the five phases of the formative method for adapting psychotherapy (FMAP), an approach that involves collaborating with service users as a first step to generate and support ideas for therapy adaptation. Examples based on clinical and practical experience are presented, along with suggestions for applying these changes in different cultural contexts.

In a growing population where the majority of patients are treated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, the efficacy of treatment is short term and accompanied by negative side effects. Utilisation of complimentary therapies in dementia care settings presents as one of few options that are attractive to practitioners and families as patients often have reduced insight and ability to verbally communicate adverse reactions. Amongst the most distressing features of dementia are the behavioural and psychological symptoms. Addressing this facet has received particular interest in aromatherapy trials, with a shift in focus from reducing cognitive dysfunction to the reduction of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia.","To assess the efficacy of aromatherapy as an intervention for people with dementia.","ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, was searched on 26 November 2012 and 20 January 2013 using the terms: aromatherapy, lemon, lavender, rose, aroma, alternative therapies, complementary therapies, essential oils.","All relevant randomised controlled trials were considered. A minimum length of a trial and requirements for follow-up were not included, and participants in included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any type and severity. The review considered all trials using fragrance from plants defined as aromatherapy as an intervention with people with dementia and all relevant outcomes were considered.","Titles and abstracts extracted by the searches were screened for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review. For Burns 2011, continuous outcomes were estimated as the mean difference between groups and its 95% confidence interval using a fixed-effect model. For Ballard 2002, analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the nursing home being treated as a random effect.","Seven studies with 428 participants were included in this review; only two of these had published usable results. Individual patient data were obtained from one trial (Ballard 2002) and additional analyses performed. The additional analyses conducted using individual patient data from Ballard 2002 revealed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the aromatherapy intervention on measures of agitation (n = 71, MD -11.1, 95% CI -19.9 to -2.2) and behavioural symptoms (n = 71, MD -15.8, 95% CI -24.4 to -7.2). Burns 2011, however, found no difference in agitation (n = 63, MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.36 to 1.36), behavioural symptoms (n = 63, MD 2.80, 95% CI -5.84 to 11.44), activities of daily living (n = 63, MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.79 to 0.79) and quality of life (n = 63, MD 19.00, 95% CI -23.12 to 61.12). Burns 2011 and Fu 2013 found no difference in adverse effects (n = 124, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.46) when aromatherapy was compared to placebo.","The benefits of aromatherapy for people with dementia are equivocal from the seven trials included in this review. It is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with the included studies. More well-designed, large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia. Additionally, several issues need to be addressed, such as whether different aromatherapy interventions are comparable and the possibility that outcomes may vary for different types of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Forrester","ForeName":"Lene Thorgrimsen","Initials":"LT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Anaesthesia, NHS Grampian, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Foresterhill, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, UK, AB25 2ZN."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Maayan","ForeName":"Nicola","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spector","ForeName":"Aimee E","Initials":"AE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Buchan","ForeName":"Louise D","Initials":"LD"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soares-Weiser","ForeName":"Karla","Initials":"K"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"02","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","NlmUniqueID":"100909747","ISSNLinking":"1361-6137"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Oils, Volatile"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":[{"@attributes":{"RefType":"UpdateOf"},"RefSource":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2003;(3):CD003150","PMID":"12917949"},{"@attributes":{"RefType":"UpdateIn"},"RefSource":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Aug 19;8:CD003150","PMID":"32813272"}]},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aromatherapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Behavioral Symptoms","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Oils, Volatile","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychomotor Agitation","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24569873","10.1002\/14651858.CD003150.pub2"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24449085","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"07","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"02","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1469-493X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Jan","Day":"22"}},"Title":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","ISOAbbreviation":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev"},"ArticleTitle":"Psychological treatments for depression and anxiety in dementia and mild cognitive impairment.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"CD009125"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/14651858.CD009125.pub2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Experiencing anxiety and depression is very common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Psychological interventions have been suggested as a potential treatment for these populations. Current research suggests that people with dementia and MCI have limited opportunities for psychological treatments aimed at improving their well-being. A systematic review of the evidence on their effectiveness is likely to be useful in terms of improving outcomes for patients and for future recommendations for practice.","The main objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing anxiety and depression in people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).","We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register and additional sources for both published and unpublished data.","We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a psychological intervention with usual care or a placebo intervention (social contact control) in people with dementia or MCI.","Two review authors worked independently to select trials, extract data and assess studies for risk of bias, using a data extraction form. We contacted authors when further information was not available from the published articles.","Six RCTs involving 439 participants with dementia were included in the review, but no studies of participants with MCI were identified. The studies included people with dementia living in the community or in nursing home care and were carried out in several countries. Only one of the studies was classified as low risk of bias. Five studies were at unclear or high risk of bias due to uncertainties around randomisation, blinding and selective reporting of results. The studies used the different psychological approaches of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and counselling. Two studies were of multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention-control educational programs, diagnostic feedback or services slightly above usual care.Meta-analysis showed a positive effect of psychological treatments on depression (6 trials, 439 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.41 to -0.03, moderate quality evidence) and on clinician-rated anxiety (2 trials, 65 participants, mean difference (MD) -4.57; 95% CI -7.81 to -1.32, low quality evidence), but not on self-rated anxiety (2 trials, SMD 0.05; 95% CI -0.44 to 0.54) or carer-rated anxiety (1 trial, MD -2.40; 95% CI -4.96 to 0.16). Results were compatible with both benefit and harm on the secondary outcomes of patient quality of life, activities of daily living (ADLs), neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition, or on carers' self-rated depressive symptoms, but most of the studies did not measure these outcomes. There were no reports of adverse events.","We found evidence that psychological interventions added to usual care can reduce symptoms of depression and clinician-rated anxiety for people with dementia. We conclude that psychological interventions have the potential to improve patient well-being. Further high quality studies are needed to investigate which treatments are most effective and to evaluate the effect of psychological interventions in people with MCI."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orgeta","ForeName":"Vasiliki","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Mental Health

Anxiety is often treated with antipsychotic medication, which has limited efficacy and serious side effects. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely used to treat anxiety in a range of populations, yet no RCTs on CBT for anxiety in dementia exist. This study aims to develop a CBT for anxiety in dementia manual and to determine its feasibility in a pilot RCT.","Phase I involves the development of a CBT for anxiety in dementia manual, through a process of (1) focus groups, (2) comprehensive literature reviews, (3) expert consultation, (4) a consensus conference and (5) field testing. Phase II involves the evaluation of the manual with 50 participants with mild to moderate dementia and anxiety (and their carers) in a pilot, two-armed RCT. Participants will receive either ten sessions of CBT or treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures are anxiety and costs. Secondary outcome measures are participant quality of life, behavioural disturbance, cognition, depression, mood and perceived relationship with the carer, and carer mood and perceived relationship with the person with dementia. Measures will be administered at baseline, 15 weeks and 6 months. Approximately 12 qualitative interviews will be used to gather service-users' perspectives on the intervention.","This study aims to determine the feasibility of CBT for people with anxiety and dementia and provide data on the effect size of the intervention in order to conduct a power analysis for a definitive RCT.

national priority in many countries. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) groups can be beneficial in improving cognition and quality of life for people with dementia. The aim of the current study is to develop and evaluate a home-based individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST) programme for people with dementia which can be delivered by their family carer.","This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) will compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of iCST for people with dementia with a treatment as usual control group. The intervention consists of iCST sessions delivered by a carer for 30 minutes, 3 times a week over 25 weeks.For people with dementia the primary outcome measures are cognition assessed by the ADAS-Cog, and quality of life assessed by QoL-AD. For carers, quality of life using the SF-12 is the primary outcome measure. Using a 5% significance level, comparison of 306 participants will yield 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.35 for cognition as measured by the ADAS-Cog, and quality of life as measured by the QoL-AD. Quality of life for the carer will be measured using the SF-12. The trial will include a cost-effectiveness analysis from a public sector perspective.","The UK Department of Health has recently stressed that improving access to psychological therapies is a national priority, but many people with dementia are unable to access psychological interventions. The development of a home-based individual version of CST will provide an easy to use, widely available therapy package that will be evaluated for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in a multi centre RCT."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Mental

widely used in dementia care, which offers a range of activities for people with dementia and provides general stimulation of cognitive abilities. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of cognitive stimulation in dementia. The review included studies from the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, called ALOIS. This yielded ninety-four studies, of which fifteen were randomised controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria. The analysis included 718 subjects (407 receiving cognitive stimulation and 311 in control groups). Results were subjected to a meta-analysis. A consistent significant benefit to cognitive function was identified following treatment and the benefits appeared to be over and above any medication effects. This remained evident at follow-up up to three months after the end of treatment. In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, significant benefits were also noted for quality of life and well-being, and on staff ratings of communication and social interaction. No differences in relation to mood, activities of daily living or challenging behaviour were noted. There is consistent evidence that cognitive stimulation interventions benefit cognitive function and aspects of well-being. Cognitive stimulation should be made more widely available in dementia care.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Given the limited effectiveness of medical treatments, training care staff to understand and manage these symptoms is essential for the safety and quality of life of people with dementia. This review evaluated the effectiveness of staff training interventions for reducing BPSD. A systematic literature search identified 273 studies. Twenty studies, published between 1998 and 2010, were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Overall, there was some evidence that staff training interventions can impact on BPSD: twelve studies resulted in significant symptom reductions, four studies found positive trends and four studies found no impact on symptoms. No links were found between the theoretical orientation of training programmes and their effectiveness. Training was also found to impact on the way staff behaved towards residents. A quality screening, using pre-specified criteria, revealed numerous methodological weaknesses and many studies did not adhere to the recommended guidelines for the conduct of cluster randomised controlled trials. There is an urgent need for more high quality research and evidence-based practice in BPSD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

offers a range of enjoyable activities providing general stimulation for thinking, concentration and memory usually in a social setting, such as a small group. Its roots can be traced back to Reality Orientation (RO), which was developed in the late 1950s as a response to confusion and disorientation in older patients in hospital units in the USA. RO emphasised the engagement of nursing assistants in a hopeful, therapeutic process but became associated with a rigid, confrontational approach to people with dementia, leading to its use becoming less and less common.Cognitive stimulation is often discussed in normal ageing as well as in dementia. This reflects a general view that lack of cognitive activity hastens cognitive decline. With people with dementia, cognitive stimulation attempts to make use of the positive aspects of RO whilst ensuring that the stimulation is implemented in a sensitive, respectful and person-centred manner.There is often little consistency in the application and availability of psychological therapies in dementia services, so a systematic review of the available evidence regarding cognitive stimulation is important in order to identify its effectiveness and to place practice recommendations on a sound evidence base.","To evaluate the effectiveness and impact of cognitive stimulation interventions aimed at improving cognition for people with dementia, including any negative effects.","The trials were identified from a search of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, called ALOIS (updated 6 December 2011). The search terms used were: cognitive stimulation, reality orientation, memory therapy, memory groups, memory support, memory stimulation, global stimulation, cognitive psychostimulation. Supplementary searches were performed in a number of major healthcare databases and trial registers to ensure that the search was up to date and comprehensive.","All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive stimulation for dementia which incorporated a measure of cognitive change were included.","Data were extracted independently by two review authors using a previously tested data extraction form. Study authors were contacted for data not provided in the papers. Two review authors conducted independent assessments of the risk of bias in included studies.","Fifteen RCTs were included in the review. Six of these had been included in the previous review of RO. The studies included participants from a variety of settings, interventions that were of varying duration and intensity, and were from several different countries. The quality of the studies was generally low by current standards but most had taken steps to ensure assessors were blind to treatment allocation. Data were entered in the meta-analyses for 718 participants (407 receiving cognitive stimulation, 311 in control groups). The primary analysis was on changes that were evident immediately at the end of the treatment period. A few studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether any effects were subsequently maintained. A clear, consistent benefit on cognitive function was associated with cognitive stimulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.41, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.57). This remained evident at follow-up one to three months after the end of treatment. In secondary analyses with smaller total sample sizes, benefits were also noted on self-reported quality of life and well-being (standardised mean difference: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.11, 0.65]); and on staff ratings of communication and social interaction (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.71). No differences in relation to mood (self-report or staff-rated), activities of daily living, general behavioural function or problem behaviour were noted. In the few studies reporting family caregiver outcomes, no differences were noted. Importantly, there was no indication of increased strain on family caregivers in the one study where they were trained to deliver the intervention.","There was consistent evidence from multiple trials that cognitive stimulation programmes benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects. However, the trials were of variable quality with small sample sizes and only limited details of the randomisation method were apparent in a number of the trials. Other outcomes need more exploration but improvements in self-reported quality of life and well-being were promising. Further research should look into the potential benefits of longer term cognitive stimulation programmes and their clinical significance."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia ServicesDevelopment CentreWales, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. b.woods@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aguirre","ForeName":"Elisa","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spector","ForeName":"Aimee E","Initials":"AE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1083","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"15"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","NlmUniqueID":"100909747","ISSNLinking":"1361-6137"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Aust Occup Ther J. 2012 Oct;59(5):398-9","PMID":"22998519"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Orientation","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"2","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"2","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"5","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22336813","10.1002\/14651858.CD005562.pub2"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22217445","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"09","Day":"18"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Staff training using STAR: a pilot study in UK care homes.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"911-20"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610211002559","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems are very common in people with dementia living in care homes.

A three-step literature search was undertaken to identify measures of knowledge in dementia. An evaluation framework was employed articulating quality indicators for the psychometric properties of measures, based on their development and use within research studies. Five measures were identified: the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Test (ADKT, Dieckmann et al., 1988); the University of Alabama Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Test for Health Professionals (UAB-ADKT, Barrett et al., 1997); the Dementia Quiz (DQ, Gilleard and Groom, 1994); the Knowledge of Aging and Memory Loss and Care (KAML-C, Kuhn et al., 2005) and the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS, Carpenter et al., 2009). All measures followed a standard scale development process, generally with acceptable reliability and validity. Many studies used measures on populations beyond the target sample, without re-establishing the psychometric properties of the scales. There are limitations with all the measures, including weaknesses in psychometric properties, being outdated and having limited scope. Although the ADKT was once suited to international use and has established psychometric properties, some items are now outdated. The ADKS positions itself as an updated version of the ADKT, yet has not been used beyond the original development study. The DQ is most the suitable for family carers. All measures require periodic updates, to keep pace with the expanding field of dementia. More robust, contemporary measures of knowledge are required.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is increasing recognition that psychosocial interventions may have similar levels of effectiveness to medication, and both can be used in combination. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is a 7-week cognitive-based approach for dementia that has been shown to be beneficial for cognition and quality of life and is cost-effective, but there is less conclusive evidence for the effects of CST over an extended period.","This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Maintenance CST groups for dementia compares a intervention group who receive CST for 7 weeks followed by the Maintenance CST programme once a week for 24 weeks with the control group who receive CST for 7 weeks, followed by treatment as usual for 24 weeks.The primary outcome measures are quality of life of people with dementia assessed by the QoL-AD and cognition assessed by the ADAS-Cog. Secondary outcomes include the person with dementia's mood, behaviour, activities of daily living, ability to communicate and costs; as well as caregiver health-related quality of life. Using a 5% significance level, comparison of 230 participants will yield 80% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.39 on the ADAS-Cog between the groups.

disability and associated problems including high physical dependency, problems in the patient\/carer relationship, and increased cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Despite this, there is little research on the detection or management of anxiety in dementia, and nothing from the perspective of people with dementia or their carers.","This study aimed to conceptualize users', carers' and staff views on the causes and management of anxiety in dementia. Eighty-one participants (users, carers and staff) participated in nine focus groups. Results were analysed using a mind-map technique and the 'long table approach'.","Themes related to the causes of anxiety included coming to terms with the diagnosis, loss of skills, physical and environmental factors and relationships with others. Themes related to the management of anxiety included coming to terms with the diagnosis, person-centred care, memory aids, enjoyable and distracting activities, management of physical and environmental problems and medication as a last resort.","Support around diagnosis, person-centred care, fostering good relationships and engagement in meaningful activity are of great importance to people with dementia and those who care for them. Yet in clinical practice, people with dementia suffering from anxiety may receive no help or else be given medication due to a lack of understanding of what else might help.

This has coincided with an increase in high-quality research in the area, and restrictions in the use of drug therapies for Alzheimer's disease in the UK. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a brief group treatment for people with mild-to-moderate dementia, based on the theoretical concepts of reality orientation and cognitive stimulation. It involves 14 sessions of themed activities which typically run twice a week over a 7-week period. A multicenter, randomized controlled trial showed significant benefits in cognition and participant-rated quality of life when comparing CST versus no treatment. These benefits in cognition were comparable to those gained through medication, and CST also proved to be cost-effective. Influenced by this research, the latest guidelines released by NICE recommended cognitive stimulation only as an intervention for treating the cognitive symptoms of dementia.
