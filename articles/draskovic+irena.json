Alongside an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial in which we studied the effectiveness of DCM on residents and staff outcomes, we investigated differences in costs of care between DCM and usual care in nursing homes.","Dementia special care units were randomly assigned to DCM or usual care. Nurses from the intervention care homes received DCM training, a DCM organizational briefing day and conducted the 4-months DCM-intervention twice during the study. A single DCM cycle consists of observation, feedback to the staff, and action plans for the residents. We measured costs related to health care consumption, falls and psychotropic drug use at the resident level and absenteeism at the staff level. Data were extracted from resident files and the nursing home records. Prizes were determined using the Dutch manual of health care cost and the cost prices delivered by a pharmacy and a nursing home. Total costs were evaluated by means of linear mixed-effect models for longitudinal data, with the unit as a random effect to correct for dependencies within units.","34 units from 11 nursing homes, including 318 residents and 376 nursing staff members participated in the cost analyses. Analyses showed no difference in total costs. However certain changes within costs could be noticed. The intervention group showed lower costs associated with outpatient hospital appointments over time (p = 0.05) than the control group. In both groups, the number of falls, costs associated with the elderly-care physician and nurse practitioner increased equally during the study (p<0.02).","DCM is a cost-neutral intervention. It effectively reduces outpatient hospital appointments compared to usual care. Other considerations than costs, such as nursing homes' preferences, may determine whether they adopt the DCM method.","Dutch Trials Registry NTR2314."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands ;

Dementia-care mapping is a person-centred care method that may alleviate both the resident and the staff problems. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dementia-care mapping in nursing-home dementia care.","The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial, with nursing homes grouped in clusters. Studywise minimisation is the allocation method. Nursing homes in the intervention group will receive a dementia-care-mapping intervention, while the control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is resident agitation, to be assessed with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. The secondary outcomes are resident neuropsychiatric symptoms, assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory--Nursing Homes and quality of life, assessed with Qualidem and the EQ-5D. The staff outcomes are stress reactions, job satisfaction and job-stress-related absenteeism, and staff turnover rate, assessed with the Questionnaire about Experience and Assessment of Work, the General Health Questionnaire-12, and the Maastricht Job Satisfaction Scale for Health Care, respectively. We will collect the data from the questionnaires and electronic registration systems. We will employ linear mixed-effect models and cost-effectiveness analyses to evaluate the outcomes. We will use structural equation modelling in the secondary analysis to evaluate the plausibility of a theoretical model regarding the effectiveness of the dementia-care mapping intervention. We will set up process analyses, including focus groups with staff, to determine the relevant facilitators of and barriers to implementing dementia-care mapping broadly.","A novelty of dementia-care mapping is that it offers an integral person-centred approach to dementia care in nursing homes. The major strengths of the study design are the large sample size, the cluster-randomisation, and the one-year follow-up. The generalisability of the implementation strategies may be questionable because the motivation for person-centred care in both the intervention and control nursing homes is above average. The results of this study may be useful in improving the quality of care and are relevant for policymakers.","The trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR2314."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2012 van de Ven et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, P.O.

For more detailed information on what the Group's specialized register contains and to view the search strategies see the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group methods used in reviews.The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources were also searched separately on 5 April 2009.","Randomised controlled trials of cognitive reframing interventions for family carers of people with dementia.","Three assessors (MVD, ID, JmC) independently judged whether the intervention being studied was documented in a trial; two assessors assessed trial quality.","Pooled data indicated a beneficial effect of cognitive reframing interventions on carers' psychological morbidity, specifically anxiety (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.04), depression (SMD -0.66; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.05), and subjective stress (SMD -0.23; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.04). No effects were found for carers' coping, appraisal of the burden, reactions to their relatives' behaviors, or institutionalization of the person with dementia.","Cognitive reframing for family carers of people with dementia seems to reduce psychological morbidity and subjective stress but without altering appraisals of coping or burden. The results suggest that it may be an effective component of individualised, multi-component interventions for carers. Identifying studies with relevant interventions was a challenge for this review. The impact of cognitive reframing might be higher when used alongside other interventions because this offers better opportunities to tailor cognitive reframing to actual everyday carer problems."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Quality of Care Research\/Alzheimer Center, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.

of quality of life (QoL) by rating QoL and burden. The authors assessed 97 spouses in a cross-sectional study with the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL), Self-Rated Burden scale (SRB), self-perceived stress scale (EDIZ; Ervaren Druk door Informele Zorg\/Self-Perceived Pressure from Informal Care), and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Patient cognition was rated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Factors best predicting QoL were analyzed with multiple regression analysis. Eighty-seven (53% male, mean 72 y) fulfilled the SEIQoL internal reliability criteria, and had a mean SEIQoL score of 68.6+\/-14.8. Most important QoL domains were condition of patient (31%) and marriage (26%). Caregiver burden scores on SRB, Ervaren Druk door Informele, Zorg, and ZBI were 44.1+\/-23.5 (n=67), 4.9+\/-2.2 (n=53), and 13.1+\/-6.2 (n=53), respectively. Mean patient MMSE score (0 to 30) was 20.3+\/-4.2. Spouses experienced lower QoL than Alzheimer disease patients and healthy elderly (historical controls), and perceived moderate levels of burden. Patient cognition is a significant predictor of caregiver QoL. Burden, measured by ZBI, is significantly negatively correlated with SEIQoL. The results underline the importance of implementing health services known to improve QoL and alleviate burden, and to explore new effective interventions."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sch\u00f6lzel-Dorenbos","ForeName":"Carla J M","Initials":"CJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Memory Clinic Slingeland Hospital\/Alzheimer Centre Nijmegen, University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Kruisbergseweg 25, Doetinchem 7009 BL, The Netherlands. c.scholzel@slingeland.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Draskovic","ForeName":"Irena","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra J","Initials":"MJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Olde Rikkert","ForeName":"Marcel G M","Initials":"MG"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord","NlmUniqueID":"8704771","ISSNLinking":"0893-0341"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["psychology","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Spouses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"6","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"6","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"7","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19484919","10.1097\/wad.0b013e318190a260"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17582827","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"08","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"23","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Development of quality indicators for memory clinics.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"119-28"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To develop and validate a set of relevant, feasible, and reliable quality indicators (QIs) for the Memory Clinics (MCs).","MCs are important care providers for people with dementia and their caregivers.
