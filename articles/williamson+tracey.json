The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and needs of people living with YOD (younger than 65 years) and gain an understanding of the issues that impact on them.","Participants' homes, support group premises or university rooms.","14 people with a diagnosis of YOD from a northern UK city.","Semistructured, in-depth interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed cross-sectionally following principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis.","Four superordinate themes are reported on 'process of diagnosis', 'the impact of living YOD', 'needs of people with YOD' and 'living well with YOD'. Nine subordinate themes captured participant experiences of developing cognitive difficulties, after being diagnosed with YOD, and subsequently living with the condition. Key issues that emerging included a lack of general awareness of YOD; how this can delay help seeking; commonalities in prediagnosis trajectories; retrospective understanding of prediagnosis symptom patterns; the difficulties of obtaining a firm diagnosis; the importance of face-to-face support and difficulties associated with daily living. Participants also described the emotional and psychological impact of the condition and the importance of formal and informal support networks.","People who have a diagnosis of YOD regard themselves as distinct from older people with dementia. Despite similar symptoms, the context in which they experience the condition creates a range of distinct psychosocial concerns not commonly well addressed by health and social care services. As awareness of YOD continues to grow, the development (or adaptation) of services that take into account the idiosyncratic needs of people with YOD should be addressed."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.
