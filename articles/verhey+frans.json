Therefore, this study aimed to examine the predictive accuracy of the \"LIfestyle for BRAin Health\" (LIBRA) score, a weighted compound score of 12 modifiable risk and protective factors, for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in midlife and late-life, and in individuals with high or low genetic risk based on presence of the apolipoprotein (APOE) \u03b54 allele.","The LIBRA score was calculated for participants from the Finnish Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE) population-based study examined in midlife (n = 1024) and twice in late-life (n = 604) up to 30 years later. Diagnoses of MCI and dementia were made according to established criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between LIBRA and risk of dementia and MCI in models adjusted for sex and education (age as timescale).","Higher midlife LIBRA scores were related to higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.43) and MCI (unadjusted model: HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.22) up to 30 years later. Higher late-life LIBRA scores were related to higher risk of MCI (HR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25), but not dementia (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.84-1.24). Higher late-life LIBRA scores were related to higher dementia risk among apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 non-carriers.","Findings emphasize the importance of modifiable risk and protective factors for dementia prevention."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as vascular pathology. Given the increased risk of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and inflammation among APOE-\u03b54 carriers, we aimed to examine whether BBB dysfunction and inflammation contribute to the relationship between APOE and AD key pathologies, as measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We applied bootstrapped regression and path analyses involving Q-albumin CSF\/plasma ratio (a BBB\/blood-CSF barrier function marker), interleukins (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12p70; inflammation markers), and CSF p-Tau and amyloid-\u03b2 (AD pathology markers) of 97 participants (aged 38-83\u00a0years) from a university memory clinic. Our results showed that relationship between BBB dysfunction and AD pathology is modulated by IL-6 and these associations appear to be driven by the APOE-\u03b54 genotype. This suggests that APOE-\u03b54-related vascular factors are also part of the pathway to AD pathology, in synergy with an elevated immune response, and could become targets for trials focused on delaying AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s).

The objective of this study was to examine associations between BBB leakage, cSVD, neurodegeneration, and cognitive performance across the spectrum from normal cognition to dementia. Leakage was measured with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in 80 older participants (normal cognition, n\u00a0= 32; mild cognitive impairment, n\u00a0= 34; clinical AD-type dementia, n\u00a0= 14). Associations between leakage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, hippocampal volume, and cognition (information processing speed and memory performance) were examined with multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses. Leakage within the gray and white matter was positively associated with WMH volume (gray matter, p\u00a0= 0.03; white matter, p\u00a0= 0.01). A negative association was found between white matter BBB leakage and information processing speed performance, which was mediated by WMH volume. Leakage was not associated with hippocampal volume. WMH pathology is suggested to form a link between leakage and decline of information processing speed in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Predisposing, enabling, and need variables were investigated to find out whether there is equitable access to dementia-specific formal care services. Results can identify which specific factors should be a target to improve access.","A total of 451 People with middle-stage dementia and their informal carers from eight European countries were included. At baseline, there was no use of formal care yet, but people were expected to start using formal care within the next year. Logistic regressions were carried out with one of four clusters of service use as dependent variables (home social care, home personal care, day care, admission). The independent variables (predisposing, enabling, and need variables) were added to the regression in blocks.","The most significant predictors for the different care clusters are disease severity, a higher sum of (un)met needs, hours spent on informal care, living alone, age, region of residence, and gender.","The Andersen model provided for this cohort the insight that (besides need factors) the predisposing variables region of residence, gender, and age do play a role in finding access to care. In addition, it showed us that the numbers of hours spent on informal care, living alone, needs, and disease severity are also important predictors within the model's framework.

healthcare budgets remains high, partially due to the ageing population. Economic evaluation can be a helpful tool to inform resource allocation in publicly financed systems. Such evaluations frequently use health-related outcome measures. However, in areas such as care of older people, improving health outcomes is not necessarily the main focus of care interventions and broader outcome measures, including outcomes for those providing informal care, may be preferred when evaluating such interventions. This paper validates a recently introduced well-being measure, the ICECAP-O, in a population of informal carers for people with dementia from eight European countries.","Convergent and discriminant validity tests were performed to validate the ICECAP-O using data obtained in a sample of 451 respondents from Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. These respondents completed a number of standardized questionnaires within the framework of the Actifcare project.","The ICECAP-O performed well among informal carers, in terms of both convergent and discriminant validity. In the multivariate analysis, it was found to be significantly associated with the age of the person with dementia, EQ-5D-5L health problem index of the person with dementia, carer-patient relationship, care recipient CDR, carer LSNS Score, the PAI score, and Perseverance Time.","The ICECAP-O appears to be a valid measure of well-being in informal carers for people with dementia. The ICECAP-O may therefore be useful as an outcome measure in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at such informal carers, when these aim to improve well-being beyond health."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry-Duxbury","ForeName":"Meg","Initials":"M","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5293-2457","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Erasmus

We aimed to establish robust prediction models of disease progression in people at risk of dementia.","In this modelling study, we included people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from single-centre and multicentre cohorts in Europe and North America: the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease (EMIF-AD; n=883), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n=829), Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC; n=666), and the Swedish BioFINDER study (n=233). Inclusion criteria were a baseline diagnosis of MCI, at least 6 months of follow-up, and availability of a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MRI or CSF biomarker assessment. The primary endpoint was clinical progression to any type of dementia. We evaluated performance of previously developed risk prediction models-a demographics model, a hippocampal volume model, and a CSF biomarkers model-by evaluating them across cohorts, incorporating different biomarker measurement methods, and determining prognostic performance with Harrell's C statistic. We then updated the models by re-estimating parameters with and without centre-specific effects and evaluated model calibration by comparing observed and expected survival. Finally, we constructed a model combining markers for amyloid deposition, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration (ATN), in accordance with the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association research framework.","We included all 2611 individuals with MCI in the four cohorts, 1007 (39%) of whom progressed to dementia. The validated demographics model (Harrell's C 0\u00b762, 95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b765), validated hippocampal volume model (0\u00b767, 0\u00b762-0\u00b772), and updated CSF biomarkers model (0\u00b772, 0\u00b768-0\u00b774) had adequate prognostic performance across cohorts and were well calibrated. The newly constructed ATN model had the highest performance (0\u00b774, 0\u00b771-0\u00b776).","We generated risk models that are robust across cohorts, which adds to their potential clinical applicability. The models could aid clinicians in the interpretation of CSF biomarker and hippocampal volume results in individuals with MCI, and help research and clinical settings to prepare for a future of precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease. Future research should focus on the clinical utility of the models, particularly if their use affects participants' understanding, emotional wellbeing, and behaviour.","ZonMW-Memorabel."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Most such biomarker studies are targeted to specific proteins or are biased toward high abundant proteins.","4001 plasma proteins were measured in two groups of participants (discovery group\u00a0=\u00a0516, replication group\u00a0=\u00a0365) selected from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study, all of whom had measures of amyloid.","A panel of proteins (n\u00a0=\u00a044), along with age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54, predicted brain amyloid deposition with good performance in both the discovery group (area under the curve\u00a0=\u00a00.78) and the replication group (area under the curve\u00a0=\u00a00.68). Furthermore, a causal relationship between amyloid and tau was confirmed by Mendelian randomization.","The results suggest that high-dimensional plasma protein testing could be a useful and reproducible approach for measuring brain amyloid deposition."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

status (SES) exist, but their determinants are not well understood.","This study investigates whether health conditions and lifestyle-related risk factors explain the SES inequalities in dementia risk.","6,346 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing were followed up from 2008\/2009 until 2014\/2015. We used Cox regression adjusted for age, gender, wealth\/education, and clustering at the household level to examine the association between SES markers (wealth, education) and time to dementia in a structural equation model including potential mediation or effect modification by a weighted compound score of twelve modifiable risk and protective factors for dementia ('LIfestyle for BRAin health' (LIBRA) score).","During a median follow-up of 6 years, 192 individuals (3.0%) developed dementia. LIBRA scores decreased with increasing wealth and higher educational level. A one-point increase in the LIBRA score was associated with a 13% increase in dementia risk (hazard ratio (HR)\u200a=\u200a1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.19). Higher wealth was associated with a decreased dementia risk (HR\u200a=\u200a0.58, 0.39-0.85). Mediation analysis showed that 52% of the risk difference between the highest and lowest wealth tertile was mediated by differences in LIBRA (indirect effect: HR\u200a=\u200a0.75, 0.66-0.85). Education was not directly associated with dementia (HR\u200a=\u200a1.05, 0.69-1.59), but was a distal risk factor for dementia by explaining differences in wealth and LIBRA scores (indirect effect high education: HR\u200a=\u200a0.92, 0.88-0.95).","Socioeconomic differences in dementia risk can be partly explained by differences in modifiable health conditions and lifestyle factors."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deckers","ForeName":"Kay","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer

Slow decline in both domains was observed in 26% of the US sample and 74% of the Dutch sample. Rapid decline in cognition and IADL was observed in 7% of the US sample and 26% of the Dutch sample.

These results call for careful consideration when comparing progression estimates in the literature. In addition, the observed discrepancy between cognitive and functional decline stresses the need to monitor dementia progression across multiple domains."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

experiences, attitudes, barriers and facilitators concerning access to and use of formal care. A total of 85 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted in eight European countries. Results were analysed with a deductive content analysis, first within country and then integrated in a cross-national analysis. Overall, analysis of the in-depth interviews revealed two major themes with five subcategories. The results can be summarised in an optimal pathway for access to dementia care. This pathway includes fixed factors such as disease-related factors and system-related factors. In addition there are personal factors that are subject to change such as attitudes towards care. An important finding consisted of the necessity of having sufficient information about the disease and available care and having a key contact person to guide you through the process of finding suitable care while monitoring your needs. In addition, it is important to involve your social network as they can take on care-giving tasks. It is helpful to have a diagnosis (in most countries). Concerning decision-making, the person closest to the person with dementia is in the majority of cases the one who makes the ultimate decision to access and use services and he\/she should therefore be supported in this process. These results provide insight into the factors that influence the pathway to formal care use and help professionals to enhance access to formal dementia care by focusing on factors that can be modified.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

The EU-Actifcare project analysed access to and use of formal services, as related to unmet needs for care. We describe the cohort study implementation and baseline results in Portugal, with a focus on needs for care and service use assessments.","Our convenience sample consisted of 66 dyads of community-dwelling people with mild to moderate dementia and no significant use of formal services, and their informal carers. Measures included the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly and Resources Utilization in Dementia.","People with dementia had unmet needs (mean 1.1; SD 1.7), mainly regarding company (23%), psychological distress (20%), and daily activities (14%). Family caregivers spent 150 minutes\/day (median) providing support, and 44% had psychological distress unmet needs. Problems with access to or use of formal services, when present, were frequently due to attitudes or lack of knowledge of any or both members of the dyad.","The recruitment process was challenging, since the inclusion criteria were restrictive. Not claiming generalizability, we recruited a typical sample of Portuguese people with mild to moderate dementia and no significant formal community support. Levels and type of unmet needs found in some participants would call for formal support, were it not for problems regarding access or use.","There are difficulties regarding timely access and effective use of formal care in dementia, along with relevant unmet needs."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gon\u00e7alves-Pereira","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro de Estudos de Doen\u00e7as Cr\u00f3nicas - CEDOC.

increasing worldwide, due to our aging society. Without a disease-modifying drug available, risk reduction strategies are to date the only promising way to reduce dementia incidence in the future. Substantial evidence exists that lifestyle factors contribute to the risk of dementia, such as physical exercise, mental activity and (non-)smoking. Still, most people seem unaware of a relationship between lifestyle and brain health. This paper investigates dementia literacy and knowledge of modifiable risk and protective factors of dementia in a Dutch population-based sample.","An online-survey was carried out among 590 community-dwelling people between 40 and 75\u2009years old in the Province of Limburg, the Netherlands. The total group comprises both of a provincial sample (n\u2009=\u2009381) and a sample of three specific districts within the province (n\u2009=\u2009209). Dementia awareness and knowledge about 12 risk and protective factors was assessed with items derived from the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey, supplemented with custom items developed by the research team.","The majority of participants (56%) were unaware of a relationship between lifestyle and dementia risk. Most individuals identified low cognitive activity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet as dementia risk factors. Particular gaps in knowledge existed with regard to major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease. Although the level of awareness varied by age and level of education, most people (70%) were eager to learn more about the topic of brain health, and indicated to be interested in using eHealth (54%) to measure or improve brain health.","Most people still are unaware of the relation between lifestyle and brain health, indicating the need for public health campaigns. Increasing awareness in the general population about the presence of modifiable dementia risk and protective factors is a crucial first step prior to implementation of preventative measures. Targeting specific subgroups, such as individuals with low socioeconomic status and low health literacy, is essential for the reach and effect of a prevention campaign. Outcome of this study was the rationale for an awareness campaign in The Netherlands, called \"MijnBreincoach\" (\"MyBraincoach\")."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Heger","ForeName":"Irene","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer

driving studies investigating patients with different neurodegenerative disorders are scarce. A variety of driving errors have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear which types of driving errors occur most frequently. Moreover, patients with other neurodegenerative disorders than AD typically present with different symptoms and impairments, therefore different driving errors may be expected.","Patients with AD (n\u200a=\u200a80), patients with other neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive decline (i.e., vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies\/Parkinson's disease, n\u200a=\u200a59), and healthy older drivers (n\u200a=\u200a45) participated in a fitness-to-drive assessment study including on-road driving.","Patients with AD performed significantly worse than healthy older drivers on operational, tactical, visual, and global aspects of on-road driving. In patients with AD, on-road measures were significantly associated with 'off-road' measures. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders other than AD showed large overlap in the types of driving errors. Several driving errors were identified that appear to be characteristic for patients with particular neurodegenerative disorders.","Patients from each group of neurodegenerative disorders commonly display tactical driving errors regarding lane positioning, slow driving, observation of the blind spot, and scanning behavior. Several other tactical and operational driving errors, including not communicating with cyclists and unsteady steering, were more frequently observed in patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. These findings have implications for on-road and 'off-road' fitness-to-drive assessments for patients with neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive

psychotropic drugs. Thus far, studies on psychotropic drug use (PDU) mainly focused on elderly patients with dementia. It is important to know the prevalence and correlates of PDU in patients with young-onset dementia (YOD) to optimize NPS treatment and reduce excess PDU in this group.","The Behavior and Evolution in Young-Onset Dementia (BEYOnD) study is a cross-sectional study in 230 residents with YOD in eight nursing homes providing specialized YOD care. PDU was registered from medical charts. The influence of age, gender, severity, and type of dementia, NPS, and agitation on PDU was analyzed.","Eighty-seven percent of the residents used psychotropic drugs, and 47% used two or more psychotropic drugs. No significant associations with age, gender, dementia subtype, and dementia severity were found. Depressive symptoms showed an association with the use of antidepressants, nighttime behavior with use of hypnotics, and verbal agitation with antipsychotics. Apathy was strongly associated with lower PDU.","Nursing home patients with YOD have a high prevalence of PDU. The association with NPS raises questions of efficacy of these drugs in managing NPS. Patients with apathy had a lower chance of using psychotropics. More research on indications and effects of psychotropic drugs is needed, as well as on (nonpharmacological) alternatives for managing challenging behavior in YOD."]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["long-term care","nursing home","psychotropic drug use","young-onset

Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between survival and age, sex, dementia subtype and comorbidity. Additionally, the impact on remaining life expectancy was explored.","During the six-year follow-up, 77 of the participants died (38.9%), 78 participants survived (39.4%) and 43 were lost to follow-up (21.7%). The mean survival time after symptom onset and diagnosis was 209 months (95% CI 185-233) and 120 months (95% CI 110-130) respectively. Participants with AD had a statistically significant shorter survival compared with VaD participants, both regarding survival after symptom onset (p = 0.047) as well as regarding survival after diagnosis (p = 0.049). Younger age at symptom onset or at diagnosis was associated with longer survival times. The remaining life expectancy, after diagnosis, was reduced with 51% for males and 59% for females compared to the life expectancy of the general population in the same age groups.","It is important to consider the dementia subtype when persons with YOD and their families are informed about the prognosis of survival. Our study suggests longer survival times compared to other studies on YOD, and survival is prolonged compared to studies on LOD. Younger age at symptom onset or at diagnosis was positively related to survival but diagnosis at younger ages, nevertheless, still diminishes life expectancy

We aimed to identify what influences RQ in dyads of people with dementia and their carers and to examine differences in their perspectives.","Cross-sectional data were used from the Actifcare cohort study of 451 community-dwelling people with dementia and their primary carers in eight European countries. Comprehensive assessments included the Positive Affect Index (RQ) and the Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC).","Regression analyses revealed that RQ as perceived by people with dementia was associated with carer education, stress, and spouse caregiving. RQ as perceived by carers was associated with carer stress, depression, being a spouse, social support, reported neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, and carer SOC. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and carer stress contributed to discrepancies in RQ ratings within the dyad. The only factor associated with both individual RQ ratings and discrepancies was carer stress (negative feelings subscore). No significant differences in the overall perception of RQ were evident between spouses and adult children carers, but RQ determinants differed between the two.","In this European sample, carer SOC was associated with carer-reported RQ. RQ determinants differed according to the perspective considered (person with dementia or carer) and carer subgroup.

costs, governments face challenges organizing access to care.","To examine the costs related to formal and informal care use and quality of life for people with dementia in eight European countries, and explore the association with unmet needs.","Cross-sectional data from 451 persons with dementia and their informal caregivers of the Actifcare cohort study were obtained. Formal and informal care use was multiplied by country specific unit prices of services. Needs were measured using the CANE and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the person with dementia (both self- and proxy-rated) and informal caregiver's quality of life using EQ-5D-5L, ICECAP-O, DEMQOL-U, and CarerQol utility scores. The association between costs and country, European region, and unmet needs was assessed using multi-level linear regression.","Self-rated EQ-5D-5L utility score was higher than proxy-rated (0.84 and 0.71, respectively). Informal caregivers' utility score was 0.84. Across eight countries annual mean costs of formal and informal care were approximately \u20ac 17,000. Unmet needs were not associated with annual costs of care, nor with proxy-rated HRQOL, but were associated with self-rated HRQOL.","We found varying relationships between unmet needs and quality of life, and no association between unmet needs and care costs, although the results were sensitive to various factors. Future research should further investigate the relation between unmet needs, quality of life and costs to generate a better understanding of the effects of (un)timely access to care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Handels","ForeName":"Ron L H","Initials":"RLH","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Care Science and Society, Division of Neurogeriatrics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sk\u00f6ldunger","ForeName":"Anders","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Care Science and Society, Division of Neurogeriatrics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Medical Faculty, Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Edwards","ForeName":"Rhiannon Tudor","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gon\u00e7alves-Pereira","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CEDOC, Chronic Diseases Research Centre, NOVA Medical School\/Faculdade de Ci--ncias M\u00e9dicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jelley","ForeName":"Hannah","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Services Development Centre Wales (DSDC), Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kerpershoek","ForeName":"Liselot","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Marques","ForeName":"Maria J","Initials":"MJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CEDOC, Chronic Diseases Research Centre, NOVA Medical School\/Faculdade de Ci--ncias M\u00e9dicas, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Meyer","ForeName":"Gabriele","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Medical Faculty, Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Michelet","ForeName":"Mona","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health, Vestfold Health Trust, T--nsberg, Norway."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Norway."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Portolani","ForeName":"Elisa","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Unit -

The present study investigated the relationship of A\u03b2 and p-tau with hippocampal subfield volumes Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1-4, dentate gyrus (DG), and subiculum. Subfields were segmented from T1-weighted images from the ADNI-population using FreeSurfer v6. Linear and polynomial regression models revealed distinct associations of A\u03b2 and p-tau with subfield volumes. A\u03b2 had a quadratic relationship with all hippocampal subfield volumes and the inflection point was higher than the validated cut-off for A\u03b2. For p-tau the relationships were linear, except for CA3, in which it was quadratic. For the CA1 and CA3, these quadratic relationships with A\u03b2 were only observed when p-tau was low. Amyloid and p-tau contributed equally to the explained variance in CA4 and DG volume. Subicular volume was best explained by A\u03b2 alone. These biomarker relationships with hippocampal subfield volumes seem to mirror the hippocampal-specific topography of A\u03b2 and tau reported in neuropathological staging models. In addition, using continuous values of A\u03b2 reveals positive patterns with imaging markers for individuals around the positivity threshold that would be masked when using dichotomized biomarker groups, which can be important for early detection and accurate inclusion of potential participants at risk for AD in clinical trials."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"M\u00fcller-Ehrenberg","ForeName":"Lisa","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty

(AD), there is an urgent need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers to predict amyloid pathology. The aim of this study was to assess whether easily obtainable measures from structural MRI, combined with demographic data, cognitive data and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotype, can be used to predict amyloid pathology using machine-learning classification.","We examined 810 subjects with structural MRI data and amyloid markers from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery study, including subjects with normal cognition (CN, n\u2009=\u2009337, age\u00a066.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2, 50% female, 27% amyloid positive), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n\u2009=\u2009375, age\u00a069.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5, 53% female, 63% amyloid positive) and AD dementia (n\u2009=\u200998, age\u00a067.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7, 48% female, 97% amyloid positive). Structural MRI scans were visually assessed and Freesurfer was used to obtain subcortical volumes, cortical thickness and surface area measures. We first assessed univariate associations between MRI measures and amyloid pathology using mixed models. Next, we developed and tested an automated classifier using demographic, cognitive, MRI and APOE \u03b54 information to predict amyloid pathology. A support vector machine (SVM) with nested 10-fold cross-validation was applied to identify a set of markers best discriminating between amyloid positive and amyloid negative subjects.","In univariate associations, amyloid pathology was associated with lower subcortical volumes and thinner cortex in AD-signature regions in CN and MCI. The multi-variable SVM classifier provided an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 in MCI and an AUC of 0.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 in CN. In CN, selected features for the classifier included APOE \u03b54, age, memory scores and several MRI measures such as hippocampus, amygdala and accumbens volumes and cortical thickness in temporal and parahippocampal regions. In MCI, the classifier including demographic and APOE \u03b54 information did not improve after additionally adding imaging measures.","Amyloid pathology is associated with changes in structural MRI measures in CN and MCI. An automated classifier based on clinical, imaging and APOE \u03b54 data can identify the presence of amyloid pathology with a moderate level of accuracy. These results could be used in clinical trials to pre-screen subjects for anti-amyloid therapies."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ten

trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e1002660"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pmed.1002660","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This study reports the findings of the first large-scale Phase III investigator-driven clinical trial to slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease with a dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blocker, nilvadipine. Nilvadipine, licensed to treat hypertension, reduces amyloid production, increases regional cerebral blood flow, and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-tau activity in preclinical studies, properties that could have disease-modifying effects for Alzheimer disease. We aimed to determine if nilvadipine was effective in slowing cognitive decline in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.","NILVAD was an 18-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that randomised participants between 15 May 2013 and 13 April 2015. The study was conducted at 23 academic centres in nine European countries. Of 577 participants screened, 511 were eligible and were randomised (258 to placebo, 253 to nilvadipine). Participants took a trial treatment capsule once a day after breakfast for 78 weeks. Participants were aged >50 years, meeting National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke\/Alzheimer's disease Criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA) for diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease, with a Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) score of \u226512 and <27. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 mg sustained-release nilvadipine or matched placebo. The a priori defined primary outcome was progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale-12 (ADAS-Cog 12) in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (n = 498), with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) as a gated co-primary outcome, eligible to be promoted to primary end point conditional on a significant effect on the ADAS-Cog 12. The analysis set had a mean age of 73 years and was 62% female. Baseline demographic and Alzheimer disease-specific characteristics were similar between treatment groups, with reported mean of 1.7 years since diagnosis and mean SMMSE of 20.4. The prespecified primary analyses failed to show any treatment benefit for nilvadipine on the co-primary outcome (p = 0.465). Decline from baseline in ADAS-Cog 12 on placebo was 0.79 (95% CI, -0.07-1.64) at 13 weeks, 6.41 (5.33-7.49) at 52 weeks, and 9.63 (8.33-10.93) at 78 weeks and on nilvadipine was 0.88 (0.02-1.74) at 13 weeks, 5.75 (4.66-6.85) at 52 weeks, and 9.41 (8.09-10.73) at 78 weeks. Exploratory analyses of the planned secondary outcomes showed no substantial effects, including on the CDR-sb or the Disability Assessment for Dementia. Nilvadipine appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Mortality was similar between groups (3 on nilvadipine, 4 on placebo); higher counts of adverse events (AEs) on nilvadipine (1,129 versus 1,030), and serious adverse events (SAEs; 146 versus 101), were observed. There were 14 withdrawals because of AEs. Major limitations of this study were that subjects had established dementia and the likelihood that non-Alzheimer subjects were included because of the lack of biomarker confirmation of the presence of brain amyloid.","The results do not suggest benefit of nilvadipine as a treatment in a population spanning mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.","Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02017340, EudraCT number 2012-002764-27."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lawlor","ForeName":"Brian","Initials":"B","Identifier":"0000-0002-5012-2116","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Mercer's Institute for Research on Ageing, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Gerontology, Trinity College Dublin (TCD), Dublin, Ireland."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Segurado","ForeName":"Ricardo","Initials":"R","Identifier":"0000-0002-3547-6733","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for Support and Training in Analysis and Research (CSTAR), University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland."},{"Affiliation":"School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sport Science, University College Dublin (UCD), Dublin, Ireland."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kennelly","ForeName":"Sean","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Age Related Healthcare, Tallaght Hospital, Dublin, Ireland."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Gerontology, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Olde Rikkert","ForeName":"Marcel G M","Initials":"MGM","Identifier":"0000-0003-1397-1677","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Radboudumc Alzheimer Center, Donders Institute of Medical Neurosciences, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Howard","ForeName":"Robert","Initials":"R","Identifier":"0000-0002-3071-2338","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, University College London and King's College London, London, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pasquier","ForeName":"Florence","Initials":"F","Identifier":"0000-0001-9880-9788","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CHU Lille, Univ.

We determined the incremental predictive value of frailty and comorbidity for mortality and institutionalization across both short and long prediction periods in persons with dementia.","Longitudinal clinical cohort study with a follow-up of institutionalization and mortality occurrence across 7\u00a0years after baseline.","331 newly diagnosed dementia patients, originating from 3 Alzheimer centers (Amsterdam, Maastricht, and Nijmegen) in the Netherlands, contributed to the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity (4C) Study.","We measured comorbidity burden using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) and constructed a Frailty Index (FI) based on 35 items. Time-to-death and time-to-institutionalization from dementia diagnosis onward were verified through linkage to the Dutch population registry.","After 7\u00a0years, 131 patients were institutionalized and 160 patients had died. Compared with a previously developed prediction model for survival in dementia, our Cox regression model showed a significant improvement in model concordance (U) after the addition of baseline CIRS-G or FI when examining mortality across 3\u00a0years (FI: U\u00a0=\u00a00.178, P\u00a0=\u00a0.005, CIRS-G: U\u00a0=\u00a00.180, P\u00a0=\u00a0.012), but not for mortality across 6\u00a0years (FI: U\u00a0=\u00a00.068, P\u00a0=\u00a0.176, CIRS-G: U\u00a0=\u00a00.084, P\u00a0=\u00a0.119). In a competing risk regression model for time-to-institutionalization, baseline CIRS-G and FI did not improve the prediction across any of the periods.","Characteristics such as frailty and comorbidity change over time and therefore their predictive value is likely maximized in the short term. These results call for a shift in our approach to prognostic modeling for chronic diseases, focusing on yearly predictions rather than a single prediction across multiple years. Our findings underline the importance of considering possible fluctuations in predictors over time by performing regular longitudinal assessments in future studies as well as in clinical practice."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Reaching caregivers of people with early-stage dementia could prevent high levels of burden and psychological problems in the later stages.","The current study evaluates the effectiveness of the blended care self-management program, Partner in Balance, compared to a control group.","A single-blind randomized controlled trial with 81 family caregivers of community-dwelling people with mild dementia was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to either the 8-week, blended care self-management Partner in Balance program (N=41) or a waiting-list control group (N=40) receiving usual care (low-frequent counseling). The program combines face-to-face coaching with tailored Web-based modules. Data were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks in writing by an independent research assistant who was blinded to the treatment. The primary proximal outcome was self-efficacy (Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale) and the primary distal outcome was symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale). Secondary outcomes included mastery (Pearlin Mastery Scale), quality of life (Investigation Choice Experiments for the Preferences of Older People), and psychological complaints (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety and Perceived Stress Scale).","A significant increase in favor of the intervention group was demonstrated for self-efficacy (care management, P=.002; service use P=.001), mastery (P=.001), and quality of life (P=.032). Effect sizes were medium for quality of life (d=0.58) and high for self-efficacy care management and service use (d=0.85 and d=0.93, respectively) and mastery (d=0.94). No significant differences between the groups were found on depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress.","This study evaluated the first blended-care intervention for caregivers of people with early-stage dementia and demonstrated a significant improvement in self-efficacy, mastery, and quality of life after receiving the Partner in Balance intervention, compared to a waiting-list control group receiving care as usual. Contrary to our expectations, the intervention did not decrease symptoms of depression, anxiety, or perceived stress. However, the levels of psychological complaints were relatively low in the study sample. Future studies including long-term follow up could clarify if an increase in self-efficacy results in a decrease or prevention of increased stress and depression. To conclude, the program can provide accessible preventative care to future generations of caregivers of people with early-stage dementia.","Netherlands Trial Register NTR4748; http:\/\/www.trialregister.nl\/trialreg\/admin\/rctview.asp?TC=4748 (Archived by WebCite at http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6vSb2t9Mg)."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9Lizzy MM Boots, Marjolein E de Vugt, Gertrudis IJM Kempen, Frans RJ Verhey.

The barriers and facilitators to service use from the perspectives of different stakeholders involved are not well understood. Thus, we aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of access to and utilisation of formal care from the perspectives of people with dementia, their informal carers and health and social care professionals.","Focus groups with people with dementia, informal carers and professionals were conducted in eight European countries. Recruitment targeted people with dementia, informal carers with experience of formal care and professionals involved in providing (access to) formal care. Qualitative content analysis using open coding was used on a national level. Cross-national synthesis was based on the translated national reports.","Overall, 55 focus groups with 261 participants were conducted, involving 51 people with dementia, 96 informal carers and 114 professionals. Sixteen categories describing barriers and facilitators were identified, referring to three global themes: Aspects related to 1) individuals involved, 2) the system or 3) overarching aspects. The attitudes and beliefs of people with dementia and their carers may have a major impact, and they often serve as barriers. Formal care was perceived as a threat to the individual independence of people with dementia and was thus avoided as long as possible. A healthcare professional serving as a constant key contact person could be an essential facilitator to overcome these barriers. Contact should be initiated proactively, as early as possible, and a trusting and consistent relationship needs to be established. Beyond that, the findings largely confirm former research and show that barriers to accessing and using formal care still exist across Europe despite a number of national and European initiatives.","Further investigations are needed to elaborate how the concept of a key contact person could be integrated with existing case management approaches and how the independence and autonomy of people with dementia can be strengthened when formal care needs to be accessed and used. These may be meaningful facilitators regarding enhanced access to formal care for people with dementia and their families."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Astrid","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, 06112, Halle (Saale), Germany. astrid.stephan@medizin.uni-halle.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, 06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joyce","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Unit, IRCCS S.

pathology of white matter signal abnormalities (WMSAs) is heterogeneous and may vary dependent on the magnetic resonance imaging contrast used to define them. We investigated differences in white matter diffusivity as an indicator for white matter integrity underlying WMSA based on T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging contrast. In addition, we investigated which white matter region of interest (ROI) could predict clinical diagnosis best using diffusion metrics. One hundred three older individuals with varying cognitive impairment levels were included and underwent neuroimaging. Diffusion metrics were extracted from WMSA areas based on T1 and FLAIR contrast and from their overlapping areas, the border surrounding the WMSA and the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Regional diffusivity differences were calculated with linear mixed effects models. Multinomial logistic regression determined which ROI diffusion values classified individuals best into clinically defined diagnostic groups. T1-based WMSA showed lower white matter integrity compared to FLAIR WMSA-defined regions. Diffusion values of NAWM predicted diagnostic group best compared to other ROI's. To conclude, T1- or FLAIR-defined WMSA provides distinct information on the underlying white matter integrity associated with cognitive decline. Importantly, not the \"diseased\" but the NAWM is a potentially sensitive indicator for cognitive brain health status.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

Caregiver characteristics (i.e. vulnerabilities and resources) were administered retrospectively.","Caregivers who more frequently used the coping strategies 'seeking distraction', 'seeking social support', and 'fostering reassuring thoughts' experienced less emotional reactivity towards stressful daily events.

neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) between young-onset dementia (YOD) and late-onset dementia (LOD), and (2) to investigate whether the possible differences can be attributed to differences in dementia subtype, gender, psychotropic drug use (PDU), or dementia severity.","Three hundred and eighty-six nursing home (NH) residents with YOD and 350 with LOD were included. Multilevel modeling was used to compare NPS between the groups . Furthermore, dementia subtype, gender, PDU, and dementia severity were added to the crude multilevel models to investigate whether the possible differences in NPS could be attributed to these characteristics.","Higher levels of apathy were found in NH residents with YOD. After the characteristics were added to the models, also lower levels of verbally agitated behaviors were found in YOD .","We recommend that special attention be paid to interventions targeting apathy in YOD. Although no differences in other NPS were found, the PDU rates were higher in YOD, suggesting that the threshold for the use of PDU in the management of NPS is lower. This underscores the need for appropriate attention to non-pharmacological interventions for the management of NPS in YOD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Appelhof","ForeName":"Britt","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Department

influence on neurodegeneration and cognition in predementia stages remains unclear. We investigated the association between CVD and A\u03b2 on neurodegenerative markers and cognition in patients without dementia.","We included 271 memory clinic patients with subjective or objective cognitive deficits but without dementia from the BioBank Alzheimer Center Limburg cohort (n\u2009=\u200999) and the LeARN (n\u2009=\u200950) and DESCRIPA (n\u2009=\u2009122) multicenter studies. CSF A\u03b2 and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging\u00a0(MRI) scans were used as measures of A\u03b2 and CVD, respectively. Individuals were classified into four groups based on the presence (+) or absence (-) of A\u03b2 and WMH. We investigated differences in phosphorylated tau, total tau (t-tau), and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) between groups using general linear models. We examined cognitive decline and progression to dementia using linear mixed models and Cox proportional hazards models. All analyses were adjusted for study and demographics.","MTA and t-tau were elevated in the A\u03b2\u2009-\u2009WMH+, A\u03b2\u2009+\u2009WMH-, and A\u03b2\u2009+\u2009WMH+ groups. MTA was most severe in the A\u03b2\u2009+\u2009WMH+ group compared with the groups with a single pathology. Both WMH and A\u03b2 were associated with cognitive decline, but having both pathologies simultaneously was not associated with faster decline.","In the present study, we found an additive association of A\u03b2 and CVD pathology with baseline MTA but not with cognitive decline. Because our findings may have implications for diagnosis and prognosis of memory clinic patients and for future scientific research, they should be validated in a larger sample with longer follow-up."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bos","ForeName":"Isabelle","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

member with dementia puts caregivers at risk of overburdening. Electronic health (eHealth) support for caregivers offers an opportunity for accessible tailored interventions. The blended care self-management program \"Partner in Balance\" (PiB) for early-stage dementia caregivers was executed in Dutch dementia care organizations. The program combines face-to-face coaching with tailored Web-based modules. Next to an evaluation of program effectiveness, an evaluation of sampling and intervention quality is essential for the generalizability and interpretation of results.","The aim of this study was to describe the process evaluation from the perspective of both family caregivers (participants) and professionals delivering the intervention (coaches) to determine internal and external validity before the effect analysis and aid future implementation.","Implementation, sampling, and intervention quality were evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data from logistical research data, coach questionnaires (n=13), and interviews with coaches (n=10) and participants (n=49). Goal attainment scaling was used to measure treatment-induced change. Analyses were performed with descriptive statistics and deductive content analysis.","The participation rate of eligible caregivers was 51.9% (80\/154). Recruitment barriers were lack of computer and lack of need for support. Young age and employment were considered recruitment facilitators. All coaches attended training and supervision in blended care self-management. Deviations from the structured protocol were reported on intervention time, structure, and feedback. Coaches described an intensified relationship with the caregiver post intervention. Caregivers appreciated the tailored content and positive feedback. The blended structure increased their openness. The discussion forum was appreciated less. Overall, personal goals were attained after the program (T>50). Implementation barriers included lack of financing, time, and deviating target population.","Participants and coaches were satisfied with the intervention, but adapting the content to specific subgroups, for example, younger caregivers, was recommended. Implementation of the program requires more awareness of the benefits of blended care self-management programs and training in tailored self-management skills.","Dutch Trial Register (NTR): NTR4748; http:\/\/www.trialregister.nl (Archived by WebCite at http:\/\/www.webcitation.org\/6vSb2t9Mg)."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9Lizzy MM Boots, Marjolein E de Vugt, Claudia MJ Smeets, Gertrudis IJM Kempen, Frans RJ Verhey.

Therefore, an assessment strategy has recently been developed for the prediction of fitness to drive in patients with the Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether this strategy is also predictive of fitness to drive in patients with non-AD dementia, that is, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Predictors were derived from 3 types of assessment: clinical interviews, neuropsychological tests, and driving simulator rides. The criterion was the pass-fail outcome of an official on-road driving assessment. About half of the patients with non-AD dementia (n=34) failed the on-road driving assessment. Neuropsychological assessment [area under the curve (AUC)=0.786] was significantly predictive of fitness to drive in patients with non-AD dementia, however, clinical interviews (AUC=0.559) and driving simulator rides (AUC=0.404) were not. The fitness-to-drive assessment strategy with the 3 types of assessment combined (AUC=0.635) was not found to significantly predict fitness to drive in non-AD dementia. Different types of dementia require different measures and assessment strategies."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piersma","ForeName":"Dafne","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Departments

(AD). Understanding the association between amyloid aggregation and cognitive manifestation in persons without dementia is important for a better understanding of the course of AD and for the design of prevention trials.","To investigate whether amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation is associated with cognitive functioning in persons without dementia.","This cross-sectional study included 2908 participants with normal cognition and 4133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from 53 studies in the multicenter Amyloid Biomarker Study. Normal cognition was defined as having no cognitive concerns for which medical help was sought and scores within the normal range on cognitive tests. Mild cognitive impairment was diagnosed according to published criteria. Study inclusion began in 2013 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed in January 2017.","Global cognitive performance as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and episodic memory performance as assessed by a verbal word learning test. Amyloid aggregation was measured with positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and dichotomized as negative (normal) or positive (abnormal) according to study-specific cutoffs. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between amyloid aggregation and low cognitive scores (MMSE score \u226427 or memory z score\u2264-1.28) and to assess whether this association was moderated by age, sex, educational level, or apolipoprotein E genotype.","Among 2908 persons with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [12.8] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory scores after age 70 years (mean difference in amyloid positive vs negative, 4% [95% CI, 0%-7%] at 72 years and 21% [95% CI, 10%-33%] at 90 years) but was not associated with low MMSE scores (mean difference, 3% [95% CI, -1% to 6%], P\u2009=\u2009.16). Among 4133 patients with MCI (mean [SD] age, 70.2 [8.5] years), amyloid positivity was associated with low memory (mean difference, 16% [95% CI, 12%-20%], P\u2009<\u2009.001) and low MMSE (mean difference, 14% [95% CI, 12%-17%], P\u2009<\u2009.001) scores, and this association decreased with age. Low cognitive scores had limited utility for screening of amyloid positivity in persons with normal cognition and those with MCI. In persons with normal cognition, the age-related increase in low memory score paralleled the age-related increase in amyloid positivity with an intervening period of 10 to 15 years.","Although low memory scores are an early marker of amyloid positivity, their value as a screening measure for early AD among persons without dementia is limited."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jansen","ForeName":"Willemijn

Disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"309-320"},"ELocationID":"10.3233\/JAD-170522","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Abnormal insulin signaling in the brain has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD).","To evaluate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) insulin levels are associated with cognitive performance and CSF amyloid-\u03b2 and Tau. Additionally, we explore whether any such association differs by sex or APOE \u025b4 genotype.","From 258 individuals participating in the Parelsnoer Institute Neurodegenerative Diseases, a nationwide multicenter memory clinic population, we selected 138 individuals (mean age 66\u00b19 years, 65.2% male) diagnosed with subjective cognitive impairment (n\u200a=\u200a45), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n\u200a=\u200a44), or AD (n\u200a=\u200a49), who completed a neuropsychological assessment, including tests of global cognition and memory performance, and who underwent lumbar puncture. We measured CSF levels of insulin, amyloid-\u03b21-42, total (t-)Tau, and phosphorylated (p-)Tau.","CSF insulin levels did not differ between the diagnostic groups (p\u200a=\u200a0.136). Across the whole study population, CSF insulin was unrelated to cognitive performance and CSF biomarkers of AD, after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes status, and clinic site (all p\u22650.131). Importantly, however, we observed effect modification by sex and APOE \u025b4 genotype. Specifically, among women, higher insulin levels in the CSF were associated with worse global cognition (standardized regression coefficient -0.483; p\u200a=\u200a0.008) and higher p-Tau levels (0.353; p\u200a=\u200a0.040). Among non-carriers of the APOE \u025b4 allele, higher CSF insulin was associated with higher t-Tau (0.287; p\u200a=\u200a0.008) and p-Tau (0.246; p\u200a=\u200a0.029).","Our findings provide further evidence for a relationship between brain insulin signaling and AD pathology. It\u00a0also highlights the need to consider sex and APOE \u025b4 genotype when assessing the role of insulin."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Geijselaers","ForeName":"Stefan L

investigate the relationship between different neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and the level of distress experienced by nurses caring for residents with young-onset dementia (YOD) and (2) to compare these findings with those for nurses caring for residents with late-onset dementia (LOD).","This is a retrospective study conducted in Dutch long-term care facilities. Data were used from the Behavior and Evolution of Young-ONset Dementia studies (BEYOND) Parts I and II and the WAAL Behavior in Dementia-II (Waalbed-II) study.","A total of 382 nursing home residents with YOD and 261 nursing home residents with LOD were included.","The Neuropsychiatric Inventory, nursing home version, was used to assess nursing staff distress and the frequency (F) and severity (S) of NPS. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationships between nursing staff distress related to NPS and YOD and LOD care units, the F\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0S score per symptom, gender, dementia subtype, and dementia severity.","Nurses working in YOD care units rated sleep and nighttime behavior disorders, delusions, and agitation\/aggression most often as highly distressing and euphoria most often as not distressing. Multivariate analyses indicated that the frequency and severity of NPS were significantly associated with staff distress in all symptoms, except for apathy. Comparison of the 2 groups of nurses demonstrated that the odds for distress related to sleep and nighttime behavior disorders were higher for nurses in YOD care units than for nurses in LOD units. For both the YOD and LOD nurses, irritability in male residents had higher impact than similar behavior in female residents.","This study provides important insight into distress related to individual NPS and the interaction with residents' characteristics. All NPS result in distress. The frequency and severity of the behavior is an important predictor. Sleep and nighttime behavior disorders are more likely to result in distress in YOD nurses than in LOD nurses. The amount of distress related to NPS emphasizes the urgent need for adequate management of NPS and the support of professional caregivers."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia, but no study has systematically reviewed this association. Therefore, we summarized the available evidence on the association between coronary heart disease and risk for cognitive impairment or dementia.","Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for all publications until 8th January 2016. Articles were included if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1) myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary heart disease (combination of both) as predictor variable; (2) cognition, cognitive impairment or dementia as outcome; (3) population-based study; (4) prospective (\u22651 year follow-up), cross-sectional or case-control study design; (5) \u2265100 participants; and (6) aged \u226545 years. Reference lists of publications and secondary literature were hand-searched for possible missing articles. Two reviewers independently screened all abstracts and extracted information from potential relevant full-text articles using a standardized data collection form. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We pooled estimates from the most fully adjusted model using random-effects meta-analysis.","We identified 6,132 abstracts, of which 24 studies were included. A meta-analysis of 10 prospective cohort studies showed that coronary heart disease was associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.21-1.74, p<0.001). Between-study heterogeneity was low (I2 = 25.7%, 95%CI = 0-64, p = 0.207). Similar significant associations were found in separate meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies for the individual predictors (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris). In contrast, meta-analyses of cross-sectional and case-control studies were inconclusive.","This meta-analysis suggests that coronary heart disease is prospectively associated with increased odds of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. Given the projected worldwide increase in the number of people affected by coronary heart disease and dementia, insight into causal mechanisms or common pathways underlying the heart-brain connection is needed."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deckers","ForeName":"Kay","Initials":"K","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1339-2974","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer

Online social media interventions might offer a new opportunity to increase access to social support and enhance positive interactions and openness in dementia care networks.","This explorative pilot study describes (1) the development of an online social support intervention Inlife, and (2) the evaluation of the feasibility of this intervention and the measurements to assess its effectiveness.","The Medical Research Council (MRC) framework guided the development of the online social support intervention. This is a stepwise approach that integrates potential users' views with the development and validation of the program content. The program was developed by combining (1) individual caregiver interviews (n = 10), (2) focus group sessions with experts and web designers (n = 6), and (3) individual think-aloud tests (n = 2). Subsequently, a pilot study with informal caregivers was conducted (n = 25) to examine the program's feasibility and preliminary effectiveness. Online self-report measures were completed at baseline and at four follow-up time points.","In total, 23 participants completed the newly developed Inlife intervention. Despite the high number of low-active users (17\/23, 73%), Inlife had a good feasibility score of 7.1 (range: 1-10). The Calendar and Timeline were used most frequently and contributed to better care coordination and positive interactions.","Although the Inlife platform received a sufficient feasibility rating, the uptake was not optimal. Therefore, the Inlife platform was adapted to limit the number of low-active users and improve user friendliness. Recommendations for additional treatment adherence were provided. The development according to the MRC framework and the sufficient feasibility rating of Inlife formed the basis for a future effectiveness

social isolation. Previous studies have shown promising effects of online e-health interventions. Using social media may facilitate support for dementia caregiver networks. In an iterative step-wise approach, a social support tool entitled \"Inlife\" was developed. This paper describes the design of a study evaluating the effects of Inlife and its process characteristics.","A mixed-method, randomised controlled trial with 122 caregivers of PwD will be conducted. Participants will be assigned to either the Inlife social support intervention or a waiting-list control group. After 16\u00a0weeks, the control group will obtain access to the Inlife environment. Data will be collected at baseline (T) and at 8-week (T), 16-week (T) and 42-week follow up (T). The 16-week follow-up assessment (T) is the primary endpoint to evaluate the results on the primary and secondary outcomes, measured by self-reported questionnaires. The primary outcomes include feelings of caregiver competence and perceived social support. The secondary outcomes include received support, feelings of loneliness, psychological complaints (e.g., anxiety, stress), and quality of life. A process evaluation, including semi-structured interviews, will be conducted to examine the internal and external validity of the intervention.","Using a mixed-method design, our study will provide valuable insights into the usability, effectiveness, and factors related to implementation of the Inlife intervention. Our study results will indicate whether Inlife could be a valuable social support resource in future routine dementia care.","Dutch trial register, NTR6131 .

conducted expert interviews in eight European countries with policy and political decision makers, or representatives of relevant institutions, to determine their perspectives on access to formal care for people with dementia and their carers.","Each ActifCare country (Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom) conducted semi-structured interviews with 4-7 experts (total N\u00a0=\u00a038). The interview guide addressed the topics \"Complexity and Continuity of Care\", \"Formal Services\", and \"Public Awareness\". Country-specific analysis of interview transcripts used an inductive qualitative content analysis. Cross-national synthesis focused on similarities in themes across the ActifCare countries.","The analysis revealed ten common themes and two additional sub-themes across countries. Among others, the experts highlighted the need for a coordinating role and the necessity of information to address issues of complexity and continuity of care, demanded person-centred, tailored, and multidisciplinary formal services, and referred to education, mass media and campaigns as means to raise public awareness.","Policy and political decision makers appear well acquainted with current discussions among both researchers and practitioners of possible approaches to improve access to dementia care. Experts described pragmatic, realistic strategies to influence dementia care. Suggested innovations concerned how to achieve improved dementia care, rather than transforming the nature of the services provided. Knowledge gained in these expert interviews may be useful to national decision makers when they consider reshaping the organisation of dementia care, and may thus help to develop best-practice strategies and recommendations."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Broda","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2564-6521","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany. anja.broda@medizin.uni-halle.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Meyer","ForeName":"Gabriele","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joyce","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"IRCCS S.

Due to recruitment difficulties and time constraints the original goal to include 90 caregivers was not met. The intervention was largely performed according to protocol and well received by the participants. Overall, the ESM-derived feedback was considered supportive and increased participants' awareness of their feelings and behavior. A large variance was found in the extent to which caregivers applied the feedback into their daily lives. The importance of the personal coach to provide face-to-face feedback and stimulate caregivers to implement new insights into their daily lives was emphasized. Suggestions for improvement were to reduce the time intensity of the program, to better tailor the program content to one's personal situation, and to improve the ESM device.","Although recruitment barriers were encountered, results indicate that future implementation of the ESM intervention 'Partner in Sight' is likely to be feasible in regular health care.

A total of 1394 subjects with mild cognitive impairment from 14 different studies were classified according to these research criteria, based on cognitive performance and biomarkers. We compared the frequency of 10 risk factors between the subgroups, and used Cox-regression to examine the effect of risk factors on cognitive decline. Depression, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia occurred more often in individuals with low-AD-likelihood, compared with those with a high-AD-likelihood. Only alcohol use increased the risk of cognitive decline, regardless of AD pathology. These results suggest that traditional risk factors for AD are not associated with prodromal AD or with progression to dementia, among subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Future studies should validate these findings and determine whether risk factors might be of influence at an earlier stage (i.e., preclinical) of AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

with multiple aspects of life, including cognition, daily functioning, and behavior. Despite the large heterogeneity in symptom development, these three domains are seldom studied simultaneously. This study investigates how trajectories of these domains are interrelated within individuals over time, and how they in turn are related to dementia severity and quality of life (QoL).","We used data from a longitudinal clinical cohort study, including 331 dementia patients. Cognitive status was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination, daily functioning was measured with the disability assessment for dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) were scored using the neuropsychiatric inventory. We investigated the relationships in the time course of the various dementia domains using random effects multilevel models and parallel-process growth models.","Changes in cognition and daily functioning were highly correlated over time (r = 0.85, p < 0.01), as were changes in NPS and functioning (r = -0.60, p < 0.01), while changes in cognition and NPS were not (r = -0.20, p = 0.06). All three domains were strongly associated with dementia severity over time (p < 0.01). Decreased functioning and increased NPS were both associated with decreased QoL (\u03b2 = 2.97, p < 0.01 and \u03b2 = -2.41, p < 0.01, respectively), while cognition was not (\u03b2 = 0.01, p = 0.93).","This study demonstrates the heterogeneity of dementia progression between individuals and between different dementia domains within individuals. To improve our understanding of dementia progression, future research should embrace a broader perspective encompassing multiple outcome measures along with the patient's profile, including neurological factors as well as physical, social, and psychiatric

However, longitudinal studies in memory clinic populations are mostly lacking. We aimed to study the association between gait speed and grip strength and cognitive functioning at baseline and cognitive decline over time in memory clinic patients with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.","We included 309 patients (age 70 \u00b1 9 years, 108 [35%] women, Mini-Mental State Examination 27 \u00b1 3 points). Baseline gait speed was assessed over 15 feet, grip strength with a hydraulic hand dynamometer. Cognitive functioning was assessed annually with a comprehensive test battery during 3 years.","Age- and gender-adjusted linear mixed models showed that slower gait speed was related to worse baseline attention, memory, information processing speed, and verbal fluency. Longitudinally, gait speed was related to decline in information processing speed and executive functioning. Weaker grip strength was related to worse baseline information processing speed and executive functioning but there were no longitudinal associations. Cox proportional hazards models revealed no significant associations with clinical progression.","Our findings suggest that markers of physical performance are related to current cognitive status and modestly related to cognitive decline but are seemingly not useful as an early marker of incident clinical progression."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author 2017.

Included risk and protective factors were: diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, depression, smoking, low-to-moderate alcohol use, high cognitive activity, and physical inactivity. Incident severe cognitive impairment was based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (score: 0-17) and incident dementia was based on either post-mortem consensus clinical diagnostic assessments or death certificate data.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the diagnostic impact of the amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [F]flutemetamol in early-onset dementia patients, in terms of change in (confidence in) diagnosis and patient management plan.","This prospective bi-center study included 211 patients suspected of early-onset dementia who visited a tertiary memory clinic. Patients were eligible with Mini Mental State Examination\u2009\u2265\u200918 and age at diagnosis\u2009\u2264\u200970\u00a0years and in whom the diagnostic confidence was <90% after routine diagnostic work-up. All patients underwent [F]flutemetamol PET, which was interpreted as amyloid-negative or amyloid-positive based on visual rating. Before and after disclosing the PET results, we assessed the diagnostic confidence (using a visual analog scale of 0-100%) and clinical diagnosis. The impact of [F]flutemetamol PET on the patient management plan was also evaluated.","[F]flutemetamol PET scans were positive in 133 out of 211 (63%) patients, of whom 110 out of 144 (76%) patients had a pre-PET Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and 23 out of 67 (34%) patients had a non-AD diagnosis. After disclosure of PET results, 41\/211 (19%) diagnoses changed. Overall, diagnostic confidence increased from 69 \u00b1 12% to 88 \u00b1 15% after disclosing PET results (P\u2009<\u20090.001; in 87% of patients). In 79 (37%) patients, PET results led to a change in patient management and predominantly the initiation of AD medication when PET showed evidence for amyloid pathology.","[F]flutemetamol PET changed clinical diagnosis, increased overall diagnostic confidence, and altered the patient management plan. Our results suggest that amyloid PET may have added value over the standardized diagnostic work-up in early-onset dementia patients with uncertain clinical diagnosis. This study provides evidence for the recommendations put forward in the appropriate use criteria for amyloid PET in clinical practice.","Nederlands Trial Register NTR3743 .

play an important role in the well-being of caregivers of people with dementia. Both are likely to fluctuate constantly throughout the caretaking process. Unlike standard retrospective methods, momentary assessments in daily life can provide insight into these moment-to-moment fluctuations. Therefore, in this study both retrospective and momentary assessments were used to examine the relationship between caregivers' sense of competence and their experienced positive affect (PA) in daily life.","Thirty Dutch caregivers provided momentary data on PA and daily sense of competence ratings for 6 consecutive days using the experience sampling methodology. Additionally, they reported retrospectively on their sense of competence with a traditional questionnaire.","A positive association was found between retrospective and daily measured sense of competence. Caregivers reported corresponding levels of sense of competence on both measures. Both daily and retrospective sense of competence were positively associated with the experienced levels of PA. However, daily sense of competence appeared to be the strongest predictor. Regarding the variability in PA, only daily sense of competence showed a significant association, with a higher daily sense of competence predicting a more stable PA pattern.","This study provides support for redirecting caregiver support interventions toward enhancement of positive rather than negative experiences and focusing more on caregivers' momentary emotional experiences. Momentary assessments are a valuable addition to standard retrospective measures and provide a more comprehensive and dynamic view of caregiver functioning."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

Where appropriate, random effects meta-analyses were conducted yielding pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).","Twenty-two out of 8,494 abstracts fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Sufficient evidence was found for albuminuria, mixed results for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), insufficient support for cystatin C, and tentative evidence for serum creatinine and creatinine clearance.

complementary longitudinal, clinical cohorts in the Netherlands.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"242"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Heterogeneous disease trajectories of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are frequently encountered in clinical practice, but there is still insufficient knowledge to understand the reasons and mechanisms causing this heterogeneity. In addition to correlates of the disorder, patient characteristics such as their health status, social environment, comorbidities and frailty may contribute to variability in trajectories over time. The current paper outlines the study design and the study population of and provides an overview of the data collected in the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity in Mild Cognitive Impairment (4C-MCI cohort, n\u2009=\u2009315) and Dementia (4C-Dementia cohort, n\u2009=\u2009331) Study.","The two complementary longitudinal cohorts part of the 4C study began enrolment in March 2010. Participants were prospectively recruited from three collaborating Dutch Alzheimer Centers, with three annual follow-up assessments after baseline. Extensive neuropsychological assessments, and detailed profiling of comorbidities, health and frailty at each follow up were the key features of the 4C study. As such, the 4C study was designed to study if and how patients' comorbidities and frailty are associated with the course of MCI and dementia measured with a comprehensive and multidimensional set of outcomes including cognition, daily functioning, quality of life, behavioral disturbances, caregiver burden, institutionalization and death and whether the effects of medical health and frailty differ between MCI and dementia stages of cognitive disorders.","Sampled in a clinical setting, the 4C study complements population-based studies on neurodegenerative disorders in terms of the type of assessment (e.g. comorbidity, frailty, and functional status were repeatedly assessed). The 4C study complements available clinical cohorts of MCI and dementia patients, because the exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum, to obtain a sample that is representative for the average patient visiting a memory

The first theme concerned problems in the diagnostic period. Early recognition and referral was reported as an essential area that required improvement in order to obtain appropriate help in time. The second theme discussed the need for information about YOD and the availability of care throughout the caregiving trajectory. The third theme described barriers in access to care that hindered caregivers in finding the right services. The fourth theme showed the availability of appropriate services and specific unmet needs. The fifth theme illustrated that behavioural and personality changes pose a significant challenge for caregivers and other family members.

Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local medical ethical committees of the Maastricht University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For this pilot study, 16 patients with early AD and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence with dual time resolution for 25 minutes. The Patlak graphical approach was used to quantify the BBB leakage rate and local blood plasma volume. Subsequent histogram analysis was used to determine the volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue. Differences were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables. Results The BBB leakage rate was significantly higher in patients compared with that in control subjects in the total gray matter (P < .05) and cortex (P = .03). Patients had a significantly higher volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue in the gray matter (P = .004), normal-appearing white matter (P < .04), deep gray matter (P = .01), and cortex (P = .004). When all subjects were considered, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased significantly with increasing leakage in the deep gray matter (P = .007) and cortex (P < .05). Conclusion The results of this study showed global BBB leakage in patients with early AD that is associated with cognitive decline. A compromised BBB may be part of a cascade of pathologic events that eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia.

dementia, and both types of pathology have been associated with neurodegeneration. We examined whether cSVD and A\u03b2 have independent or interactive effects on hippocampal volume (HV) in a memory clinic population. We included 87 individuals with clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n\u200a=\u200a24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n\u200a=\u200a26), and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) (n\u200a=\u200a37). cSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, lacunar infarct presence, and microbleed presence. A\u03b2 pathology was assessed as cerebrospinal fluid-derived A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 levels and dichotomized into normal or abnormal, and HV was determined by manual volumetric measurements. A linear hierarchical regression approach was applied for the detection of additive or interaction effects between cSVD and A\u03b2 on HV in the total participant group (n\u200a=\u200a87) and in the non-demented group (including SCC and MCI individuals only, n\u200a=\u200a63). The results revealed that abnormal A\u03b2 and lacunar infarct presence were independently associated with lower HV in the non-demented individuals. Interestingly, A\u03b2 and WMH pathology interacted in the non-demented individuals, such that WMH had a negative effect on HV in individuals with abnormal CSF A\u03b242 levels, but not in individuals with normal CSF A\u03b242 levels. These associations were not present when individuals with AD were included in the analyses. Our observations suggest that relatively early on in the disease process older individuals with abnormal A\u03b2 levels are at an increased risk of accelerated disease progression when concomitant cSVD is present."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Freeze","ForeName":"Whitney

for dementia, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether anxiety predicts cognitive decline and\/or dementia, taking the stage of cognitive decline as well as setting into account.","A systematic literature search up to January 2015 was performed to identify all longitudinal studies on the association between anxiety and cognition. Data extraction and methodological quality assessment were conducted independently by two authors. Where possible, pooled relative risks were calculated to examine anxiety as a possible risk factor for cognitive decline cognitive impairment and dementia in community studies (objective 1), as well as for conversion to dementia patients referred to memory clinics (objective 2).","Twenty studies met inclusion criteria. Data on cognitive decline were too heterogeneous for meta-analysis. Anxiety predicted incident cognitive impairment (4 studies, relative risk [RR]: 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38-2.26, z\u2009=\u20094.50, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and dementia (6 studies, RR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.02-2.42, z\u2009=\u20092.05, p\u2009=\u20090.040) in the community, the latter driven by studies with a mean age of 80 years or above. Among clinical mild cognitive impairment samples, anxiety did not predict conversion to dementia (RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.90-1.63, z\u2009=\u20091.28, p\u2009=\u20090.200).","Anxiety is associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia in the community. Stronger associations were driven by higher age, suggesting that it is a prodromal symptom.

This mismatch causes overall dissatisfaction and is a waste of the scarce financial care resources. This article presents the background and methods of the Actifcare (ACcess to Timely Formal Care) project. This is a European study aiming at best-practice development in finding timely access to formal care for community-dwelling people with dementia and their informal carers. There are five main objectives: 1) Explore predisposing and enabling factors associated with the use of formal care, 2) Explore the association between the use of formal care, needs and quality of life and 3) Compare these across European countries, 4) Understand the costs and consequences of formal care services utilization in people with unmet needs, 5) Determine the major costs and quality of life drivers and their relationship with formal care services across European countries.","In a longitudinal cohort study conducted in eight European countries approximately 450 people with dementia and informal carers will be assessed three times in 1\u00a0year (baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months). In this year we will closely monitor the process of finding access to formal care. Data on service use, quality of life and needs will be collected.","The results of Actifcare are expected to reveal best-practices in organizing formal care. Knowledge about enabling and predisposing factors regarding access to care services, as well as its costs and consequences, can advance the state of the art in health systems research into pathways to dementia care, in order to benefit people with dementia and their informal

neuronal cells and supplies them with essential molecules, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of this study was to noninvasively investigate 2 linked functional elements of the neurovascular unit, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF), in patients with early AD and healthy controls. Therefore, both dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging were applied to measure BBB permeability and CBF, respectively. The patients with early AD showed significantly lower CBF and local blood volume in the gray matter, compared with controls. In the patients, we also found that a reduction in CBF is correlated with an increase in leakage rate. This finding supports the hypothesis that neurovascular damage, and in particular impairment of the neurovascular unit constitutes the pathophysiological link between CBF reduction and BBB impairment in AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These have a large impact on quality of life and long-term prognosis. Several factors are involved in the development of these residual syndromes, although their exact role and their interrelationships remain still rather unclear. The Cognition and Affect after Stroke: a Prospective Evaluation of Risks (CASPER) study has been primarily designed to examine whether stroke-specific (e.g. lesion location, volume, type, severity), cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative (e.g. white matter changes, atrophy, microbleeds, perivascular spaces), inflammatory, endothelial, and (epi)genetic markers are associated with cognitive impairment, post-stroke depression, and post-stroke apathy, and whether they predict their course over 12\u00a0months. The secondary aims are to investigate how the above-mentioned markers interact with each other, and to determine if patients with apathy and depression after stroke differ in pathogenesis, course, and outcome (e.g. functional outcome, neurocognitive performance, quality of life).","CASPER is a 1-year prospective clinical cohort follow-up study in 250 stroke patients recruited at the neurological in- and outpatient services at Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+, Maastricht, The Netherlands), and Zuyderland Medical Center (Sittard and Heerlen, The Netherlands). At baseline (3\u00a0months post-stroke), a neuropsychological assessment, neuropsychiatric interview, blood sample, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan are conducted. Assessment of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive status are repeated 6 and 12\u00a0months later.","The CASPER study investigates stroke-specific, vascular, neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and genetic markers of the development of vascular cognitive impairment, depression, and apathy after stroke. This creates the possibility to study not only the contribution of these individual markers but also their joint contribution, which differentiates this study from earlier stroke cohorts who lacked long-term follow-up data, a large sample size, an extensive MRI protocol, and markers from the blood. The knowledge we derive from this study might help in identifying markers that are associated with, or can predict the onset, maintenance, and progression of vascular cognitive impairment, depression, and apathy after stroke, and could provide new insights into possibilities for treatment and rehabilitation that result in better functional outcome after stroke.","ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02585349."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Douven","ForeName":"Elles","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Center Limburg and School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+), Maastricht, The Netherlands. elles.douven@maastrichtuniversity.nl."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schievink","ForeName":"Syenna H J","Initials":"SH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Center Limburg and School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+), Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Center Limburg and School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+), Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Oostenbrugge","ForeName":"Robert J","Initials":"RJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht (CARIM), Department of Neurology, and School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+), P.O.

dementia caregivers in daily life. The Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) offers the possibility to provide a more dynamic view of caregiver functioning. ESM-derived feedback may help to redirect caregivers' behavior towards situations that elicit positive emotions and to increase their feelings of competence in the caretaking process. This paper presents the design of a study that evaluates the process characteristics and effects of the ESM-based intervention 'Partner in Sight'.","A randomized controlled trial with 90 spousal caregivers of people with dementia will be conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental (6-week ESM intervention including feedback), pseudo-experimental (6-week ESM intervention without feedback), or control group\u00a0(care as usual). Assessments will be performed pre- and post-intervention and at 2-, and 6-month follow-up. Main outcomes will be sense of competence, perceived control, momentary positive affect, and psychological complaints (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, anxiety, momentary negative affect). In addition to the effect evaluation, a process and economic evaluation will be conducted to investigate the credibility and generalizability of the intervention, and its cost-effectiveness.","The potential effects of the ESM intervention may help caregivers to endure their care responsibilities and prevent them from becoming overburdened. This is the first ESM intervention for caregivers of people with dementia. The results of this study, therefore, provide a valuable contribution to the growing knowledge on m-health interventions for dementia caregivers.","Dutch Trial Register NTR4847 ; date registered Oct 9, 2014."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Knippenberg","ForeName":"Rosalia J M","Initials":"RJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology and Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Vugt","ForeName":"Marjolein E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology and Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. m.devugt@maastrichtuniversity.nl."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ponds","ForeName":"Rudolf W","Initials":"RW","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology and Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Myin-Germeys","ForeName":"Inez","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurosciences, Center for Contextual Psychiatry, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology and Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"NTR","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"NTR4847"}}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"05","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"100968559","ISSNLinking":"1471-244X"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety","QualifierName":"prevention & control"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost-Benefit Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"prevention & control"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Spouses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"prevention & control"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Caregiver","Dementia","ESM intervention","RCT","Support"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2016","Month":"04","Day":"11"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2016","Month":"04","Day":"25"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"5","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"5","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27169811","10.1186\/s12888-016-0834-5","10.1186\/s12888-016-0834-5","PMC4865019"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Behav Res Ther. 2006 Dec;44(12):1773-85","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16488388"}},{"Citation":"Schizophr Bull. 2012 May;38(3):405-13","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"22130904"}},{"Citation":"J Health Soc Behav. 1983 Dec;24(4):385-96","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"6668417"}},{"Citation":"J Health Soc Behav. 1978 Mar;19(1):2-21","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"649936"}},{"Citation":"Neurology. 1997 May;48(5 Suppl 6):S10-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9153155"}},{"Citation":"Health Policy. 1996 Jul;37(1):53-72","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10158943"}},{"Citation":"Soc Sci Med. 1994 Dec;39(11):1537-44","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7817218"}},{"Citation":"Am Psychol. 2000 Jun;55(6):647-54","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10892207"}},{"Citation":"World Psychiatry. 2014 Feb;13(1):68-77","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24497255"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 1997;9 Suppl 1:173-6;

Reaching early-stage dementia caregivers could prevent high levels of burden and psychological problems in them in the later stages of dementia. An iterative step-wise approach was employed to develop the blended care self-management program \"Partner in Balance\" for early-stage dementia caregivers. The design of a study evaluating the process characteristics and effects is presented.","A mixed-method, single-blind, randomized controlled trial with 80 family caregivers of community-dwelling people with (very) mild dementia will be conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the 8-week blended care self-management program \"Partner in Balance\" or a waiting-list control group. Data will be collected pre intervention and post intervention and at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted post intervention. A process evaluation will investigate the internal and external validity of the intervention. Primary outcomes will include self-efficacy and symptoms of depression. Secondary outcomes will include goal attainment, mastery, psychological complaints (feelings of anxiety and perceived stress), and quality of life. Possible modifying variables such as caregiver characteristics (quality of the relationship, neurotic personality) and interventional aspects (coach) on the intervention effect will also be evaluated. A cost-consequence analysis will describe the costs and health outcomes.","We expect to find a significant increase in self-efficacy, goal attainment and quality of life and lower levels of psychological complaints (depression, anxiety and stress) in the intervention group, compared with the control group. If such effects are found, the program could provide accessible care to future generations of early-stage dementia caregivers and increase dementia care efficiency.","Dutch trial register NTR4748

disease (AD) biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in addition to routine diagnostic workup.","This study aims to investigate the added prognostic value of AD CSF biomarkers.","In a prospective cohort study, clinical experts predicted cognitive and functional symptoms in 114 memory clinic patients by assessing comprehensive routine diagnostic test information (patient history, and physical, neurological, psychiatric, neuropsychological, and MRI examinations), without and with CSF biomarkers. The reference standard was the 'observed clinically relevant decline' using baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-up information.","Decline over a 2-year period was observed in 51% of all participants (3% in SMC, 48% in MCI, 90% in mild dementia). In the total sample, the accuracy of predicted decline did not differ significantly between routine assessment without (79% correctly predicted) and with (74% correctly predicted) CSF biomarkers. Subgroup analyses revealed 25 (83%) correct predictions in SMC, 30 (68%) in MCI, and 35 (88%) in dementia without the use of CSF; and 21 (70%), 27 (61%), and 36 (90%), respectively, with the use of CSF in addition to the routine assessment.","AD CSF biomarkers did not increase accuracy of 2-year prognosis of cognitive and functional decline when added to routine diagnostic workup. This suggests that the standard diagnostic workup without CSF biomarkers allows fairly accurate predictions for the short-term course of symptoms. Routine AD biomarkers in CSF have limited prognostic value over 2 years in persons with a suspected cognitive disorder."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Handels","ForeName":"Ron L

defined as dementia that develops before the age of 65. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) have important clinical consequences for patients and their family members. To date, knowledge about the prevalence and correlates of NPS in YOD is limited, but essential to establish specific tailored care for patients with YOD. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence and correlates of NPS in nursing home residents with YOD.","Cross-sectional cohort study in Dutch long-term care facilities providing specialized care for YOD.","Participants included 230 institutionalized patients with YOD.","NPS were assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). The influence of gender, dementia severity, type of dementia, and disease awareness on clusters of relevant NPS was investigated using multivariate logistic regression analysis and subsequently corrected for the possible confounders of age, duration of institutionalization, and psychoactive medication use.","Ninety percent of the nursing home residents with YOD showed 1 or more neuropsychiatric symptoms, 88% showed significant agitation, and 56% showed relevant apathy. No gender differences were found. Although physically aggressive behavior, non-physically aggressive behavior, and apathy were more common in patients with (very) severe cognitive decline (Global Deterioration Scale [GDS] stage 6-7), verbally agitated behavior was common in patients in all except the most severe stages of dementia (GDS 2-6). Apathy was more prevalent in alcohol-related dementia. Low levels of awareness were associated with more physically aggressive behavior and aberrant motor behavior.","The prevalence of NPS was high and was associated with the severity and type of dementia and disease awareness. Agitation and apathy are the most important symptoms to focus on in YOD. The high prevalence of NPS supports the idea of care delivery in special care units. Further research is needed on potentially influencing environmental correlates of NPS in YOD."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

To enable patients to retain their mobility while at the same time not endangering public safety, each patient should be assessed for fitness to drive. The aim of this study is to develop a method to assess fitness to drive in a clinical setting, using three types of assessments, i.e. clinical interviews, neuropsychological assessment and driving simulator rides. The goals are (1) to determine for each type of assessment which combination of measures is most predictive for on-road driving performance, (2) to compare the predictive value of clinical interviews, neuropsychological assessment and driving simulator evaluation and (3) to determine which combination of these assessments provides the best prediction of fitness to drive. Eighty-one patients with AD and 45 healthy individuals participated. All participated in a clinical interview, and were administered a neuropsychological test battery and a driving simulator ride (predictors). The criterion fitness to drive was determined in an on-road driving assessment by experts of the CBR Dutch driving test organisation according to their official protocol. The validity of the predictors to determine fitness to drive was explored by means of logistic regression analyses, discriminant function analyses, as well as receiver operating curve analyses. We found that all three types of assessments are predictive of on-road driving performance. Neuropsychological assessment had the highest classification accuracy followed by driving simulator rides and clinical interviews. However, combining all three types of assessments yielded the best prediction for fitness to drive in patients with AD with an overall accuracy of 92.7%, which makes this method highly valid for assessing fitness to drive in AD. This method may be used to advise patients with AD and their family members about fitness to drive.

persons with dementia (PwD) are important because informal carers often rely on their social networks for support. This systematic review synthesises findings from research on social support interventions, and examines their methodological quality and effectiveness on caregiver social support and well-being variables.","A systematic literature search utilised five databases. Papers were selected when the primary aim of the intervention was to improve social support. Quality of papers was assessed by the Level of Evidence grade and the criteria list from the Cochrane Back Review Group.","39 papers were identified and classified into 4 social support intervention categories: befriending and peer support, family support and social network interventions, support groups, and remote interventions using the internet or telephone. Content, intensity, uptake, effectiveness and quality of interventions varied widely. In general, the level of evidence was low. Most studies measured effect on well-being variables, while few examined social support outcomes. Multi-component social support interventions were most effective. Evidence suggested, also a caregiver benefit from remote interventions. Generally, results were inconsistent; some papers demonstrated beneficial results, while others demonstrated no improvement on social support and well-being variables. Social support outcomes were more positively evaluated when qualitative outcome measures rather than quantitative measures were used.","Although multi-component social support interventions may improve caregiver well-being, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether a change in social support is the underlying mediating factor. The inclusion, validation and operationalization of caregiver social support measures deserve more attention."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although comorbidity in patients with late-onset AD (LO-AD) is common, for people with young-onset AD (YO-AD), it is unclear how often comorbidity occurs. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether comorbidity in patients with YO-AD differs from that in patients with LO-AD. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, types of morbidity, and morbidity profiles in patients with YO-AD compared with those of patients with LO-AD.","Explorative cohort study from 2 separate Dutch cohorts (Needs in Young-onset Dementia [NeedYD] and the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity-Dementia Study [4C-Dementia study]).","Participants were recruited in 2007 and 2008 from (1) the memory clinics of 3 Dutch Alzheimer centers, (2) the memory clinics of general hospitals, (3) mental health services in the southern part of the Netherlands, and (4) young-onset dementia specialized day care facilities. A comparison group of community-dwelling, elderly patients with AD was selected from the 4C-Dementia study. Patients in this study were recruited in 2010 and 2011 from the aforementioned Alzheimer centers.","The prevalence rates of comorbidity were compared between 177 patients with YO-AD and 155 patients with LO-AD. Comorbidity was classified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The total amount of comorbidity was established by counting the number of existing diseases (ICD categories or chapters) and comorbidity was also dichotomized as present or absent. Furthermore, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to study clusters of comorbidity.","Compared with LO-AD, patients with YO-AD showed less (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) overall comorbidity (58.2% vs 86.5%) and had lower prevalence rates of diabetes, obesity, and circulatory diseases; however, the prevalence rates of diseases of the nervous system in YO-AD (6.2%) were higher compared with those of patients with LO-AD (4.5%). The cluster analysis revealed a distinctive group of patients with YO-AD with either no comorbidity or with a disease of the nervous system. Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and diseases of the circulatory system were present in 34% of the patients with YO-AD.","Comorbidity is less common in YO-AD than in LO-AD. However, general practitioners should be aware that approximately one-third of the patients with YO-AD suffer from or have endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and\/or diseases of the circulatory system. Treatment should therefore not only focus on dementia but also on comorbidity. This attention may slow the functional decline in AD. These exploratory analyses suggested a higher prevalence of nervous system diseases in YO-AD compared with LO-AD. However, the finding did not reach statistical significance and in combination with the exploratory nature of the analyses justifies further investigation. If verified, this finding may help to decrease the time to diagnosis of AD and, subsequently, support in young patients with a neurological disease. Further investigation is needed to gain more insight into the association between comorbidity and AD in younger people."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Estimates of the prevalence of amyloid pathology in persons without dementia are needed to understand the development of AD and to design prevention studies.","To use individual participant data meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of amyloid pathology as measured with biomarkers in participants with normal cognition, subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).","Relevant biomarker studies identified by searching studies published before April 2015 using the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases and through personal communication with investigators.","Studies were included if they provided individual participant data for participants without dementia and used an a priori defined cutoff for amyloid positivity.","Individual records were provided for 2914 participants with normal cognition, 697 with SCI, and 3972 with MCI aged 18 to 100 years from 55 studies.","Prevalence of amyloid pathology on positron emission tomography or in cerebrospinal fluid according to AD risk factors (age, apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype, sex, and education) estimated by generalized estimating equations.","The prevalence of amyloid pathology increased from age 50 to 90 years from 10% (95% CI, 8%-13%) to 44% (95% CI, 37%-51%) among participants with normal cognition; from 12% (95% CI, 8%-18%) to 43% (95% CI, 32%-55%) among patients with SCI; and from 27% (95% CI, 23%-32%) to 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) among patients with MCI. APOE-\u03b54 carriers had 2 to 3 times higher prevalence estimates than noncarriers. The age at which 15% of the participants with normal cognition were amyloid positive was approximately 40 years for APOE \u03b54\u03b54 carriers, 50 years for \u03b52\u03b54 carriers, 55 years for \u03b53\u03b54 carriers, 65 years for \u03b53\u03b53 carriers, and 95 years for \u03b52\u03b53 carriers. Amyloid positivity was more common in highly educated participants but not associated with sex or biomarker modality.","Among persons without dementia, the prevalence of cerebral amyloid pathology as determined by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid findings was associated with age, APOE genotype, and presence of cognitive impairment. These findings suggest a 20- to 30-year interval between first development of amyloid positivity and onset of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jansen","ForeName":"Willemijn

patients, caregivers and professionals.- The diagnostic recommendations in the revised directive are based on a stepwise work-up with the aim of establishing the cause of the dementia. This is guided by the recent diagnostic criteria, evidence of the diagnostic value of additional investigations, and the patient's wishes.- Although there have been no major breakthroughs in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease in recent years, the revised guideline also contains important new recommendations in this area. For example, it includes recommendations on administration routes (first-choice use of patches or preparations with slow release of cholinesterase inhibitors), the use of combination therapy (not prescribing memantine in combination with cholinesterase inhibitors) and regular monitoring of the effectiveness of antipsychotics and cholinesterase inhibitors.- The guideline (in Dutch) can be found at www.richtlijnendatabase.nl (search for 'dementie') and will be actively implemented.

These morphological changes might lead to a less precise performance of automated brain segmentation techniques in AD-patients, which in turn could possibly lead to false allocations of gray matter, white matter or cerebrospinal fluid. FreeSurfer has been shown to operate as an accurate and reliable instrument to measure cortical thickness and volume of neuroanatomical structures. Considering the principal role of FreeSurfer in the imaging field of AD, the present study aims to investigate the robustness of FreeSurfer to capture morphological changes in the brain against varying processing variables in comparison to manual measurements (the gold standard). T1-weighted MRI scan data were used pertaining to a sample of 53 individuals (18 healthy participants, 18 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 18 patients with mild AD). Data were analyzed with different FreeSurfer versions (v4.3.1, v4.5.0, v5.0.0, v5.1.0), on a custom-built cluster (LINUX) and a Macintosh (UNIX) workstation. Group differences across versions and workstations were most consistent for both the hippocampus and posterior cingulate, regions known to be affected in the earliest stages of the disease. The results showed that later versions of FreeSurfer were more sensitive to identify group differences and corresponded best with the results of gold standard manual volumetric methods. In conclusion, later versions of FreeSurfer were more accurate than earlier versions, especially in medial temporal and posterior parietal regions. This development is very promising for future applications of FreeSurfer in research studies and encourages the future role of FreeSurfer output as a candidate marker in clinical practice."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clerx","ForeName":"Lies","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gronenschild","ForeName":"Ed H B M","Initials":"EH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Centrum Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center, P.O.

We compared the prevalence and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage according to these criteria. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 1607), 766 of whom had both amyloid and neuronal injury markers, were recruited from 13 cohorts. We used cognitive test performance and available biomarkers to classify subjects as prodromal Alzheimer's disease according to International Working Group-1 and International Working Group-2 criteria and in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, conflicting biomarker groups (isolated amyloid pathology or suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology), and low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group according to the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association criteria. Outcome measures were the proportion of subjects with Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage and progression to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia. We performed survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models. According to the International Working Group-1 criteria, 850 (53%) subjects had prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Their 3-year progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia was 50% compared to 21% for subjects without prodromal Alzheimer's disease. According to the International Working Group-2 criteria, 308 (40%) subjects had prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Their 3-year progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia was 61% compared to 22% for subjects without prodromal Alzheimer's disease. According to the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association criteria, 353 (46%) subjects were in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, 49 (6%) in the isolated amyloid pathology group, 220 (29%) in the suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology group, and 144 (19%) in the low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. The 3-year progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia was 59% in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, 22% in the isolated amyloid pathology group, 24% in the suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology group, and 5% in the low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. Our findings support the use of the proposed research criteria to identify Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage. In clinical settings, the use of both amyloid and neuronal injury markers as proposed by the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association criteria offers the most accurate prognosis. For clinical trials, selection of subjects in the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group or the International Working Group-2 prodromal Alzheimer's disease group could be considered.

overburdening in the later stages. However, the needs of early-stage dementia caregivers (EDC) remain largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the needs and wishes and need for care of EDC to maximize the benefit of potential programs for EDC and tailor interventions accordingly.","Four focus group interviews with 28 informal caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Both EDC and caregivers in the later stages were included to compare perceived EDC needs from different points in the caregiver career.","Four themes were identified: the early-stage needs paradox, barriers in acceptance, facilitators in acceptance, and a transition from loss to adaptation. The retrospective view provided by later-stage caregivers differed from the view of EDC; EDC struggled with acknowledging needs due to fear of stigma and low acceptance. EDC stressed the importance of acceptance as a prerequisite for adequate adaptation, but were hindered by lack of knowledge, difficulty acknowledging changes, and focus on loss. In contrast, better understanding of the disease, increasing personal time, structuring ones day, and using appropriate humor can reduce negative communication, increase positive encounters and caregiver-confidence, contributing to positive interaction with the care recipient and an increase in well-being.","Early therapeutic interventions could help caregivers identify their needs, increase knowledge about changes in roles and relationship reciprocity, and focus on enhancement of the positive, intact experiences to prevent caregiver burden."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Boots","ForeName":"Lizzy M M","Initials":"LM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School for Mental Health and Neuroscience,Alzheimer Center Limburg,Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology,Maastricht University Medical Center,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wolfs","ForeName":"Claire A G","Initials":"CA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School for Mental Health and Neuroscience,Alzheimer Center Limburg,Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology,Maastricht University Medical Center,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School for Mental Health and Neuroscience,Alzheimer Center Limburg,Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology,Maastricht University Medical Center,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kempen","ForeName":"Gertrudis I J M","Initials":"GI","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care,Department of Health Services Research,Maastricht University,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Vugt","ForeName":"Marjolein E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School for Mental Health and Neuroscience,Alzheimer Center Limburg,Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology,Maastricht University Medical Center,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Acceptance of Health Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Stereotyping"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":"focus group"}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"1","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"1","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"4","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25566686","S1041610214002804","10.1017\/S1041610214002804"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25551191","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"08","Day":"16"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2377","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"14","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Dec","Day":"31"}},"Title":"BMC neurology","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Neurol"},"ArticleTitle":"The Dutch Parelsnoer Institute--Neurodegenerative diseases; methods, design and baseline results.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"254"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12883-014-0254-4","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The Parelsnoer Institute is a collaboration between 8 Dutch University Medical Centers in which clinical data and biomaterials from patients suffering from chronic diseases (so called \"Pearls\") are collected according to harmonized protocols.

barrier (BBB) impairment may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and dementia. In vivo imaging studies are needed to quantify and localize the BBB defects during life, contemplating the circulatory properties. We reviewed the literature for imaging studies investigating BBB impairment in patients suffering from dementia. After selection, 11 imaging studies were included, of which 6 used contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2 used contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and 3 positron emission tomography (PET). Primarily the MRI studies hint at a subtle increasing permeability of the BBB, particularly in patients already exhibiting cerebrovascular pathology. More elaborate studies are required to provide convincing evidence on BBB impairment in patients with various stages of dementia with and without obvious cerebrovascular pathology. In the future, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI techniques and transport specific imaging using PET may further detail the research on the molecular nature of BBB defects.

The goal of this paper is to identify the major modifiable risk factors for dementia as a first step in developing an effective preventive strategy and promoting healthy late life cognitive functioning.","A mixed-method approach combined findings from a systematic literature review and a Delphi consensus study. The literature search was conducted in PubMed and updated an earlier review by the United States National Institutes of Health from 2010. We reviewed the available evidence from observational epidemiological studies. The online Delphi study asked eight international experts to rank and weigh each risk factor for its importance for dementia prevention.","Out of 3127 abstracts, 291 were included in the review. There was good agreement between modifiable risk factors identified in the literature review and risk factors named spontaneously by experts. After triangulation of both methods and re-weighting by experts, strongest support was found for depression, (midlife) hypertension, physical inactivity, diabetes, (midlife) obesity, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, while more research is needed for coronary heart disease, renal dysfunction, diet, and cognitive activity.","Findings provide good support for several somatic and lifestyle factors and

Neuropathology and structural damage in the LC appears to be one of the earliest changes. We hypothesize that reduced functional integration of the LC reflected by lower brain functional connectivity contributes to early memory dysfunction. To test this, we examined resting-state functional connectivity from the LC in 18 healthy older individuals and 18 mildly cognitively impaired patients with possible AD. Connectivity measures were correlated with memory scores. The left LC showed strong connectivity to the left parahippocampal gyrus that correlated with memory performance in healthy persons. This connectivity was reduced in aMCI patients. Lateralization of connectivity-memory correlations was altered in less impaired aMCI patients: greater right LC-left parahippocampal gyrus connectivity was associated with better memory performance, in particular for encoding. Our results provide new evidence that the LC, in interaction with the parahippocampal gyrus, may contribute to episodic memory formation. They suggest functional impairment and the possibility that associated compensatory changes contribute to preserved memory functions in early AD.

We cross-sectionally investigated whether co-morbidity and frailty were independently associated with the clinical manifestation of AD in the 4C-Dementia study; a multicenter, longitudinal study in newly diagnosed AD patients. Clinical manifestation was operationalized using a composite of cognitive performance (neuropsychological assessment), activities of daily living (Disability Assessment for Dementia; DAD) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). As predictors of prime interest, co-morbidity was determined using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) and frailty by the Fried criteria. In total, 213 AD patients participated (mean age 75 \u00b1 10 years; 58% females). In linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, and disease duration, CIRS-G (\u03b2 = -0.21, p < 0.01) and frailty (\u03b2 = -0.34, p < 0.001) were separately associated with clinical AD manifestation. However, CIRS-G (\u03b2 = -0.12, p = 0.12) lost statistical significance when both were combined (frailty: \u03b2 = -0.31, p < 0.001). Models with the individual components of clinical AD manifestation as dependent variables show significant associations between cognitive performance and CIRS-G (\u03b2 = -0.22, p = 0.01), and between DAD and frailty (\u03b2 = -0.37, p < 0.001). Our findings indicate that physical health and clinical AD manifestation are associated. This association may be responsible for part of the heterogeneity in the presentation of AD. This emphasizes the importance of adequate assessment of co-morbid medical conditions and frailty in patients with AD.

No significant differences were observed for other micronutrient or anthropometric parameters.","In non-malnourished patients with very mild AD, lower levels of some micronutrients, a different fatty acid profile in erythrocyte membranes and a slightly but significantly lower MNA screening score were observed. This suggests that subtle differences in nutrient status are present already in a very early stage of AD and in the absence of protein\/energy

age of 65 years. The prevalence and type of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in YOD differ from patients with late onset dementia. NPS in dementia patients are often treated with psychotropic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate psychotropic drug use (PDU) in Dutch community-dwelling YOD patients and the association between age, gender, dementia etiology and severity, symptoms of depression, disease awareness, unmet needs, and type of NPS.","Psychotropic drug use in 196 YOD patients was registered. Drugs were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical classification. The association between age, gender, dementia type, dementia stage, type of NPS, depressive symptoms, disease awareness, and amount of unmet needs on total PDU was analyzed using binomial logistic regression analysis.","Fifty-two percent of the patients were prescribed at least one psychotropic drug; 36.2% of patients used one drug, and 12.2% used two different drugs. Antidepressants (36.2%) and antipsychotic drugs (17.3%) were the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs. Anti-dementia drugs were prescribed in 51.5% of the patients. Increasing age and moderate to severe depressive symptoms were positively associated with the total use of psychotropic drugs.","Community-dwelling YOD patients have a high prevalence of PDU. More research is needed to study the association between unmet needs, NPS, and PDU, and psychosocial interventions have to be developed to limit the use of psychotropic drugs in YOD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C

the cognitive trajectories of individuals with incident hypertension. This study follows the cognitive functioning in prevalent and incident hypertension for 12 years and in relation to age and treatment status. Cognitively intact adults aged 25 to 84 years (n=1805) were serially assessed at baseline, 6 years, and 12 years. Hypertension was defined by sphygmomanometry or antihypertensive medication use, and its association with cognitive decline was tested in random-effects models. At baseline, 638 (35.3%) participants had hypertension. They showed faster decline in memory (\u03c7(2) test for homogeneity=35.75; df=2; P<0.001), executive functions (\u03c7(2)=21.68; df=2; P<0.001), and information processing speed (\u03c7(2)=81.96; df= 2; P<0.001) than baseline normotensive participants. At follow-up, 352 individuals (30.2%) developed incident hypertension. They showed faster decline in memory (\u03c7(2)=7.88; df=2; P=0.019) and information processing speed (\u03c7(2)= 18.06; df=2; P<0.001), especially from 6- to 12-year follow-up. Effects were most pronounced and widespread in midlife for both prevalent and incident hypertension and in those with untreated and uncontrolled hypertension. This study shows that incident hypertension predicts cognitive decline in middle-aged individuals, and those with poorly controlled blood pressure are most at risk. In newly diagnosed individuals, decline evolves gradually, possibly opening a window for early intervention.

parent who has a progressive disease, often assist in caregiving tasks, which may have a great impact on their lives. The objective of the present study is to explore the experiences of children living with a young parent with dementia with a specific focus on the children's needs.","Semi-structured interviews with 14 adolescent children between the ages of 15 and 27 years of patients with YOD were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Themes were identified based on the established codes.","The emerging categories were divided into three themes that demonstrated the impact of dementia on daily life, different ways of coping with the disease, and children's need for care and support. The children had difficulties managing all of the responsibilities and showed concerns about their future. To deal with these problems, they demonstrated various coping styles, such as avoidant or adaptive coping.

The children felt more comfortable talking to someone who was familiar with their situation and who had specific knowledge of YOD and the available services.","In addition to practical information, more accessible and specific information about the diagnosis and the course of YOD is needed to provide a better understanding of the disease for the children.

White matter hyperintensities are believed to disconnect brain areas. We examined the topographical association between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness in controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients. We examined associations between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness among 18 older cognitively healthy participants, 18 amnestic MCI, and 17 mild AD patients. These associations were cluster-size corrected for multiple comparisons. In controls, a positive association between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness was found in lateral temporal gyri. In MCI patients, white matter hyperintensities were positively related to cortical thickness in frontal, temporal, and parietal areas. Positive associations between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness in AD patients were confined to parietal areas. The results of the interaction group by white matter hyperintensities on cortical thickness were consistent with the findings of positive associations in the parietal lobe for MCI and AD patients separately. In the frontal areas, controls and AD patients showed inverse associations between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness, while MCI patients still showed a positive association. These results suggest that a paradoxical relationship between white matter hyperintensities and cortical thickness could be a consequence of neuroinflammatory processes induced by AD-pathology and white matter hyperintensities. Alternatively, it might reflect a region-specific and disease-stage dependent compensatory hypertrophy in response to a compromised network.

This paper reviews the caregiver perspective in dementia and addresses the question what the consequences are of promoting earlier dementia diagnosis. An early diagnosis offers caregivers the opportunity to advance the process of adaptation to the caregiver role. Caregivers that are better able to adapt to the changes that characterize dementia, feel more competent to care and experience less psychological problems. However, drawbacks of an early diagnosis may outweigh the benefits if people are left with a diagnosis but little support. There is convincing evidence that multicomponent caregiver interventions in the mild to moderate dementia stages are effective to improve caregiver well-being and delay institutionalization. However, there still exist a gap between the improved possibilities to diagnose people in the predementia stage versus the scarce knowledge on intervention effects in this very early stage. This stresses the urgent need for more research on early caregiver interventions that enhance role adaptation and that include long-term follow-up and cost-effectiveness evaluation. Early interventions may help caregivers in anticipating and accepting the future care role and transitions, with the increased possibility that caregivers can still involve the patient in the decision making process. As levels of stress and burden are still low in the predementia stage it provides excellent opportunities to empower the resources of caregivers.

Outcome measures included cognitive variables, conversion to AD, and biomarkers (e.g. CSF, and MRI markers). Two hierarchical cluster analyses (HCA) were performed to identify clusters of subjects with distinct cognitive profiles. The first HCA included all subjects with complete cognitive data, whereas the second one selected subjects with very mild MCI (MMSE \u226528). ANOVAs and ANCOVAs were computed to examine whether the clusters differed with regard to conversion to AD, and to AD-specific biomarkers.","The HCAs identified 4-cluster solutions that best reflected the sample structure. One cluster (aMCIsingle) had a significantly higher conversion rate (19%), compared to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, p < 0.0001), and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI, p = 0.012).

For the correlational study with biomarkers, we tested 36 SNPs in a subset of 222 AD patients with available CSF using mixed models. Statistical analyses were adjusted for age, gender and APOE status. False discovery rate for multiple testing was applied. All participants were from academic hospital and research institutions in Finland.","APOE-\u03b54, CLU rs11136000, and MS4A4A rs2304933 correlated with significantly decreased A\u03b2(1-42) (corrected p<0.05).

The most frequently hypothesized initiating factor is an accumulation of the protein amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain, which has been associated with dementia of the Alzheimer type. Another potentially important initiating factor is a disrupted blood-brain barrier. This can initiate cerebral microangiopathy, which has frequently been associated with vascular dementia. Although amyloid-\u03b2 and blood-brain barrier dysfunction have both been associated with one particular type of dementia (Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, respectively), they co-exist in most demented patients. In fact, increasing evidence indicates that amyloid-\u03b2 and blood-brain barrier disruption may interact and facilitate each other in their effect on neurodegeneration. The present systematic analysis describes the available evidence for a significant interplay between amyloid-\u03b2 and blood-brain barrier function in dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burgmans","ForeName":"Saartje","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology\/Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands. s.burgmans@maastrichtuniversity.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Haar","ForeName":"Harm J","Initials":"HJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Backes","ForeName":"Walter H","Initials":"WH"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Peptides"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Peptides","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Animals"},{"DescriptorName":"Blood-Brain Barrier","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cell Adhesion","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Data Interpretation, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Endothelium","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Monocytes","QualifierName":"pathology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23542866","843582772M04R21W","10.3233\/JAD-122155"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23540941","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1558-1497","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"34","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"Neurobiology of aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Neurobiol Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"Measurements of medial temporal lobe atrophy for prediction of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with mild cognitive impairment.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2003-13"},"ELocationID":["10.1016\/j.neurobiolaging.2013.02.002","S0197-4580(13)00064-X"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Our aim was to compare the predictive accuracy of 4 different medial temporal lobe measurements for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Manual hippocampal measurement, automated atlas-based hippocampal measurement, a visual rating scale (MTA-score), and lateral ventricle measurement were compared. Predictive accuracy for AD 2 years after baseline was assessed by receiver operating characteristics analyses with area under the curve as outcome. Annual cognitive decline was assessed by slope analyses up to 5 years after baseline. Correlations with biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were investigated. Subjects with MCI were selected from the Development of Screening Guidelines and Clinical Criteria for Predementia AD (DESCRIPA) multicenter study (n\u00a0= 156) and the single-center VU medical center (n\u00a0= 172). At follow-up, area under the curve was highest for automated atlas-based hippocampal measurement (0.71) and manual hippocampal measurement (0.71), and lower for MTA-score (0.65) and lateral ventricle (0.60). Slope analysis yielded similar results. Hippocampal measurements correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau, not with beta-amyloid 1-42. MTA-score and lateral ventricle volume correlated with CSF beta-amyloid 1-42. We can conclude that volumetric hippocampal measurements are the best predictors of AD conversion in subjects with MCI.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abnormal CSF t-tau (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.6, p = 0.03) and CSF p-tau (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3-9.2, p = 0.01) concentration and hippocampal atrophy (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.6, p = 0.02) predicted time to dementia. For subjects with both abnormal t-tau concentration and hippocampal atrophy, HR was 7.3 (95% CI 1.0-55.9, p = 0.06). Furthermore, abnormal CSF t-tau and p-tau concentrations and hippocampal atrophy predicted decline in MMSE score.","In subjects with MCI and evidence of amyloid pathology, the injury markers CSF t-tau and p-tau and hippocampal atrophy can predict further cognitive decline."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van

patients with dementia. A few studies have compared neuropsychiatric disturbances between dementia subtypes, but the results were conflicting. In the present study, we investigated whether the prevalence of NPSs differs between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). The merit of our study is that we used clinical as well as histopathological information to differentiate between dementia subtypes. This retrospective descriptive study comprised 80 brains obtained from donors to the Netherlands Brain Bank between 1984 and 2010. These donors were diagnosed postmortem with AD (n = 40) or VaD (n = 40). We assessed the presence of NPSs by reviewing the information found in the patients' medical files. The most prevalent symptom in the sample as a whole was agitation (45 cases, 57.0%), followed by depression (33, 41.2%) and anxiety (28, 35.4%). Our study tried to contribute to the discussion by including, for the first time in the literature, a sample of AD and VaD patients with neuropathologically confirmed diagnoses. Since no significant differences were found between AD and VaD patients, we suggest that the prevalence of NPSs cannot be predicted from the diagnosis of AD or VaD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ech\u00e1varri","ForeName":"Carmen","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Tissue Brain Bank of Navarre, Biomedical Research Center, Navarra Health Service, Pamplona, Spain.

We aimed to examine the gray and white matter tissue changes in individuals with memory decline over a 12-year period, who might be at risk for AD. The participants were selected from the longitudinal Maastricht Aging Study based on their scores on the verbal word learning task. A group with profound memory decline over a 12-year period (n = 20) was identified and matched with a group that did not meet this criterion (n = 20). All of the participants underwent MRI scanning. Diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness analyses were performed to investigate the white and gray matter differences respectively. We found decreased white matter integrity in the memory decline group compared to the control group in frontal and parietal brain regions and in several cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical tracts. Cortical thinning in the memory decline group was found in frontal, parietal, medial temporal and occipital areas. These results showed similarities with the structural brain changes observed in early AD. Thus, not only may cognitive changes be detected years before the clinical diagnosis, but typical gray and white matter changes appear to be present in older people with memory decline as well. This suggests that a combination of cognitive decline and structural brain changes might be an ideal biomarker for AD pathogenesis."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jacobs","ForeName":"Heidi I L","Initials":"HI","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University, The Netherlands. h.jacobs@maastrichtuniversity.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Boxtel","ForeName":"Martin P J","Initials":"MP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gronenschild","ForeName":"Ed H B M","Initials":"EH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Williams","ForeName":"Victoria J","Initials":"VJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burgmans","ForeName":"Saartje","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Uylings","ForeName":"Harry B M","Initials":"HB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jolles","ForeName":"Jelle","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United Arab Emirates","MedlineTA":"Curr Alzheimer Res","NlmUniqueID":"101208441","ISSNLinking":"1567-2050"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2011","Month":"05","Day":"04"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"03"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"7","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22920268","CAR-EPUB-20120817-1","10.2174\/156720512803568993"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22883691","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"01","Day":"31"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2377","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Aug","Day":"10"}},"Title":"BMC neurology","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Neurol"},"ArticleTitle":"Diagnostic and economic evaluation of new biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: the research protocol of a prospective cohort study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"72"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["New research criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently been developed to enable an early diagnosis of AD pathophysiology by relying on emerging biomarkers.

The clinical practice diagnosis at baseline is reflected by a consensus procedure among experts using clinical information only (no biomarkers). The diagnosis based on the new research criteria is reflected by decision rules that combine clinical and biomarker information.

neuropathological changes and follows traditional nosological classifications. However, the high incidence of comorbid neuropathologies complicates the differentiation between dementia diagnoses in the clinic. The aim of this study was to investigate the grades of agreement between clinical and neuropathological diagnoses in neurodegenerative disorders, to compare them with rates found in previous studies, and to propose implications for dementia diagnostics. Patients, who donated their brains to the Brain Bank of Navarre (Pamplona, Spain), had been diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder during life (clinical diagnosis) and postmortem (neuropathological diagnosis). We studied a sample of patients with a short average time interval between the last clinical assessment and death (4.6 months). Overall, there was a mean grade of agreement of 44.0% between the clinical diagnosis and the pure neuropathological diagnosis (i.e., without co-morbid neuropathological disorders). This grade of agreement differed between dementia subtypes: e.g., 85% for prion disease, 49% for Alzheimer's disease, and 0% for Lewy body dementia. Our data confirm that co-occurrence of multiple neuropathological disorders is very common in individuals with dementia, and that the underlying neuropathology often differs from the neuropathology implied by the clinical diagnosis. These findings support a multidimensional approach to diagnosing dementia, in which dementia syndromes are not categorized into diagnostic subtypes, but are seen as syndromes characterized by a combination of various neuropathological dimensions."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ech\u00e1varri","ForeName":"Carmen","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School for Mental Health and Neuroscience\/Alzheimer Center Limburg, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.

We hypothesized that cerebral autoregulation is impaired in patients with AD compared to subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) was investigated in 17 AD patients, 19 MCI subjects, and 20 controls (C). Groups were matched for age, gender, and level of education. Electrocardiogram and non-invasive finger arterial blood pressure were measured and transcranial doppler ultrasonography was used to measure cerebral blood flow velocity in right and left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Cerebrovascular resistance index (CVRi) was also computed. dCA in supine position was quantified based on spontaneous blood pressure variations by computation of the linear transfer function between arterial blood pressure and MCA cerebral blood flow velocity. dCA gain and phase were evaluated for different frequency bands. Results were also evaluated using a 3-parameter windkessel model (WKM). CVRi was significantly higher in AD (2.9 \u00b1 0.2) compared to both MCI (2.3 \u00b1 0.1, p = 0.02) and C (2.1 \u00b1 0.1 mmHgs\/cm, p = 0.002). Five MCI patients who converted to AD during the course of the study also had higher CVRi compared to non-converters (2.8 \u00b1 0.6 versus 2.1 \u00b1 0.5 mmHgs\/cm, p < 0.05). No significant differences in dCA gain and phase were found.

It extends the 'ABC' approach of behavioural analysis, to overcome the restriction of having to derive a single explanatory hypothesis for the person's behaviour. It is seen as a first line alternative to traditional pharmacological management for agitation and aggression. FA typically requires the therapist to develop and evaluate hypotheses-driven strategies that aid family and staff caregivers to reduce or resolve a person's distress and its associated behavioural manifestations.","To assess the effects of functional analysis-based interventions for people with dementia (and their caregivers) living in their own home or in other settings.","We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 3 March 2011 using the terms: FA, behaviour (intervention, management, modification), BPSD, psychosocial and Dementia.","Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with reported behavioural outcomes that could be associated with functional analysis for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia.","Four reviewers selected trials for inclusion. Two reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess trial quality, including bias. Meta-analyses for reported incidence, frequency, severity of care recipient challenging behaviour and mood (primary outcomes) and caregiver reaction, burden and mood were performed. Details of adverse effects were noted.","Eighteen trials are included in the review. The majority were in family care settings. For fourteen studies, FA was just one aspect\u00a0of a broad multi-component programme of care. Assessing the effect of FA was compromised by ill-defined protocols for the duration of component parts of these programmes (i.e. frequency of the intervention or actual time spent). Therefore, establishing the real effect of the FA component was not possible.Overall, positive effects were noted at post-intervention for the frequency of reported challenging behaviour (but not for incidence or severity) and for caregiver reaction (but not burden or depression). These effects were not seen at follow-up.","The delivery of FA has been incorporated within wide ranging multi-component programmes and study designs have varied according to setting - i.e. family care, care homes and hospital, with surprisingly few studies located in care homes. Our findings suggest potential beneficial effects of multi-component interventions, which utilise FA. Whilst functional analysis for challenging behaviour in dementia care shows promise, it is too early to draw conclusions about its efficacy."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moniz Cook","ForeName":"Esme D","Initials":"ED","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinical Psychology & Ageing, Institute of Rehabilitation,University of Hull, Hull,UK.

A systematic literature research was performed into DTI and MTL atrophy in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We included seventy-six studies on MTL atrophy including 8,122 subjects and fifty-five DTI studies including 2,791 subjects. Outcome measure was the effect size (ES) expressed as Hedges g. In volumetric studies, atrophy of the MTL significantly differentiated between AD and controls (ES 1.32-1.98) and MCI and controls (ES 0.61-1.46). In DTI-Fractional anisotropy (FA) studies, the total cingulum differentiated best between AD and controls (ES = 1.73) and the parahippocampal cingulum between MCI and controls (ES = 0.97). In DTI-Mean diffusivity (MD) studies, the hippocampus differentiated best between AD and controls (ES = -1.17) and between MCI and controls (ES = -1.00). We can conclude that in general, the ES of volumetric MTL atrophy measurements was equal or larger than that of DTI measurements. However, for the comparison between controls and MCI-patients, ES of hippocampal MD was larger than ES of hippocampal volume.

We tested the CSF beta amyloid (A\u03b2)1-42\/tau ratio using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and hippocampal volumes (HCVs) using the atlas-based learning embeddings for atlas propagation (LEAP) method. Outcome measure was progression to AD-type dementia in 2 years. At follow-up, 48 (31%) subjects converted to AD-type dementia. In multivariable analyses, CSF A\u03b21-42\/tau and HCV predicted AD-type dementia regardless of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and cognitive scores. Test sequence analyses showed that CSF A\u03b21-42\/tau increased predictive accuracy in subjects with normal HCV (p < 0.001) and abnormal HCV (p = 0.025). HCV increased predictive accuracy only in subjects with normal CSF A\u03b21-42\/tau (p = 0.014). Slope analyses for annual cognitive decline yielded similar results. For selection of subjects for a prodromal AD trial, the best balance between sample size and number of subjects needed to screen was obtained with CSF markers. These results provide further support for the use of CSF and magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers to identify prodromal AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The role of the parietal lobe in the development of AD is only recently beginning to attract attention. The current review discusses parietal lobe involvement in the early stages of AD, viz. mild cognitive impairment, as reported from structural, functional, perfusion and metabolic neuroimaging studies. The medial and posterior parts of the parietal lobe seem to be preferentially affected, compared to the other parietal lobe parts. On the basis of the reviewed literature we propose a model showing the relationship between the various pathological events, as measured by different neuroimaging techniques, in the development of AD.

Cognitive and behavioral changes in the person with EOD were common and difficult to understand for caregivers. Marital difficulties, problems with children and work\/financial issues were important topics. Confirmation of family members and being aware of problems at work were important for caregivers to notice deficits and\/or seek help. Other main issues were a patient's refusal to seek help resulting from denial and inadequate help resulting from misdiagnosis.","EOD caregivers experience a long and difficult period before diagnosis. We hypothesize that denial, refusal to seek help, misattribution of symptoms, lack of confirmation from the social context, professionals' inadequate help and faulty diagnoses prolong the time before diagnosis.

This study investigates whether atrophy in parietal and prefrontal areas increases the predictive value of MTL atrophy in three groups of different cognitive status. Seventy-five older adults were classified as cognitively stable (n = 38) or cognitively declining (n = 37) after three years follow-up. At follow-up, the grey matter of the MTL, inferior prefrontal cortex (IPC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was delineated on MRI scans. Six years later, a dementia assessment resulted in distinguishing and separating a third group (n = 9) who can be considered as preclinical AD cases at scan time. Ordinal logistic regressions analysis showed that the left and right MTL, as well as the right IPC and IPL accurately predicted group membership. Receiver Operating Curves showed that the MTL was best in distinguishing cognitively stable from cognitively declining individuals. The accuracy of the differentiation between preclinical AD and cognitively stable participants improved when MTL and IPL volumes were combined, while differentiating preclinical AD and cognitively declined participants was accomplished most accurately by the combined volume of all three areas. We conclude that depending on the current cognitive status of an individual, adding IPL or IPC atrophy improved the accuracy of predicting conversion to AD by up to 22%.

There was an increase both in the use of extensive neuropsychological assessments and in the use of cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics.","MCs in the Netherlands have outgrown the primarily university-based setting, have focussed less on scientific research, and have taken a place in the regular care of people with cognitive problems and people in early phases of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ramakers","ForeName":"Inez H G B","Initials":"IH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands. i.ramakers@np.unimaas.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Community Mental Health Services","QualifierName":["organization & administration","supply & distribution"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Development"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"4","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21271389","932735905","10.1080\/13607863.2010.519321"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21271386","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"04","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"01","Day":"28"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Memory services and memory clinics.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2-4"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2010.543666","AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zarit","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Editorial"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Internationality"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health Services"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"4","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21271386","932737071","10.1080\/13607863.2010.543666"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21269542","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"23","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Prevalence, incidence and risk factors of paratonia in patients with dementia: a one-year follow-up study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1051-60"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610210002449","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Paratonia is a progressive motor problem that is observed in individuals with dementia and is not a well-known phenomenon.

We investigated cortical grey matter volume patterns in parietal areas. The grey matter of the somatosensory cortex, superior and inferior parietal lobule was measured in 75 older adults (38 cognitively stable and 37 individuals with cognitive decline after 3 years). Dementia screening 6 years after scanning resulted in nine AD cases from the cognitively stable (n=3) and cognitive decline group (n=6), who were assigned to a third group, the preclinical AD group. When regional differences in cortical volume in the parietal lobe areas were compared between groups, significant differences were found between either the cognitive decline or stable group on the one hand and preclinical AD individuals on the other hand in the inferior parietal lobule. Group membership was best predicted by the grey matter volume of the inferior parietal lobule, compared to the other parietal lobe areas. The parietal lobe was characterised by a differential atrophy pattern based on cognitive status, which is in agreement with the 'last-developed-first-atrophied' principle. Future studies should investigate the surplus value of the inferior parietal lobe as a potential marker for the diagnosis of AD compared to other brain regions, such as the medial temporal lobe and the prefrontal lobe.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Aberrant motor behavior, depression, anxiety, and euphoria showed decline over time, and psychosis remained constant whereas apathy, agitation, irritability, and disinhibition increased over time.

Assessments are performed every six months over two years and consist of interviews and questionnaires with patients and caregivers. The main outcomes are (1) the needs of patients and caregivers, as measured by the Camberwell Assessment of Needs for the Elderly (CANE) and (2) neuropsychiatric symptoms, as measured by the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI).

To date, the pathophysiology of AD is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may play a pivotal role in its course and development. The most frequently studied epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation and histone modifications, and investigations relevant to aging and AD are presented in this review. Various studies on human postmortem brain samples and peripheral leukocytes, as well as transgenic animal models and cell culture studies relevant to AD will be discussed. From those, it is clear that aging and AD are associated with epigenetic dysregulation at various levels. Moreover, data on e.g. twin studies in AD support the notion that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the risk for AD. Conversely, it is still not fully clear whether the observed epigenetic changes actually represent a cause or a consequence of the disease. This is mainly due to the fact that most clinical investigations on epigenetics in AD are conducted in samples of patients already in an advanced stage of the disease. Evidently, more research is needed in order to clarify the exact role of epigenetic regulation in the course and development of AD. Research on earlier stages of the disease could provide more insight into its underlying pathophysiology, possibly contributing to the establishment of early diagnosis and the development of more effective treatment strategies.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia.","1289 patients in 56 Dementia Special Care Units (SCUs) in the Netherlands were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Potential correlates of the neuropsychiatric symptoms studied were gender and age of the patient, dementia severity, psychoactive medication use and environmental correlates such as the number of patients per unit or per living room, staff size\/patient ratio, time spent on care activities and presence of a walking circuit. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relative contribution of the different factors in explaining neuropsychiatric symptoms variability.","The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms differed between SCUs, also after correcting for patient factors. Patient-related factors explained 7-21% of the total variance of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Intra Class Correlation (the correlation of symptoms of patients within SCUs) ranged from 0.039 (psychosis) to 0.163 (apathy). The variance in SCU symptom prevalence (variance between SCUs) accounted for 3.5-14.8% of the total variance in neuropsychiatric symptoms. In SCUs of which the staff spent more time on care activities did the patients show lower levels of apathy. Other environmental correlates did not predict neuropsychiatric symptoms.","The substantial variation of prevalence rates between SCUs in combination with the clustering of symptoms within SCUs is strong evidence for the environmental contribution to neuropsychiatric symptoms and the multifactorial nature of behaviour in dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zuidema","ForeName":"Sytse U","Initials":"SU","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Centre for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health, Radboud University Nijmegen, Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

There is an urgent need for cost-effective support programs that prevent informal caregivers of people with dementia from becoming overburdened, which might result in a delay or decrease of patient institutionalization. For this reason, we have developed the Systematic Care Program for Dementia (SCPD). The SCPD consists of an assessment of caregiver's sense of competence and suggestions on how to deal with competence deficiencies. The efficiency of the SCPD will be evaluated in our study.","In our ongoing, cluster, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial, the participants in six mental health services in four regions of the Netherlands have been randomized per service. Professionals of the ambulatory mental health services (psychologists and social psychiatric nurses) have been randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The study population consists of community-dwelling people with dementia and their informal caregivers (patient-caregiver dyads) coming into the health service. The dyads have been clustered to the professionals. The primary outcome measure is the patient's admission to a nursing home or home for the elderly at 12 months of follow-up. This measure is the most important variable for estimating cost differences between the intervention group and the control group. The secondary outcome measure is the quality of the patient's and caregiver's lives.","A novelty in the SCPD is the pro-active and systematic approach. The focus on the caregiver's sense of competence is relevant to economical healthcare, since this sense of competence is an important determinant of delay of institutionalization of people with dementia. The SCPD might be able to facilitate this with a relatively small cost investment for caregivers' support, which could result in a major decrease in costs in the management of dementia. Implementation on a national level will be started if the SCPD proves to be efficient.","NCT00147693."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spijker","ForeName":"Anouk","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Scientific

neuropsychiatric symptoms in demented nursing home patients.","Neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed in a large sample of 1319 Dutch nursing home patients using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). The influence of gender and severity of cognitive decline, assessed with the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), was investigated using logistic regression analysis and subsequently corrected for possible confounders, such as age, duration of institutionalization and psychoactive medication use.","While physically aggressive behaviour was more common in patients with very severe cognitive deterioration (GDS stage 7), disinhibition, irritability, physically non-aggressive and verbally agitated behaviour were more common in patients in GDS stage 5 or 6. Physically aggressive behaviour was more common in men, whereas female patients demonstrated more verbally agitated behaviour. With respect to other neuropsychiatric symptoms, delusions and depression were also more common in patients in GDS stage 5 and 6, while prevalences of anxiety and apathy further increased in severely demented patients (GDS stage 7). Apathy was more prevalent in male patients, while depression and anxiety were more common in females.","In nursing home patients, neuropsychiatric symptoms were associated with the severity of dementia, with most symptoms occurring in patients showing (moderately) severe cognitive decline. Only physical aggression, anxiety and apathy were more common in patients with very severe cognitive decline.

Due to the large numbers of affected patients, even interventions bringing about a relatively small delay in disease onset could have large public health effects. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of preventive interventions, but such trials raise specific methodological questions because they are new in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and require large numbers of elderly subjects and lengthy follow-up periods. We performed a literature search to identify primary prevention RCTs for neurodegenerative dementia. The methodology of the trials was summarized and discussed during two expert meetings. Overall, 39 trials were identified that assessed dementia incidence or cognitive decline as a primary or secondary study outcome. Age was the most common selection criteria for target populations. Follow-up periods ranged from one month to nine years and were longest in studies measuring dementia incidence as an outcome. Results of RCTs have so far been generally negative and conflicting with those of observational studies, perhaps due to methodological issues. Future trials must therefore carefully consider the target population, outcomes and duration of follow-up to be used, and should assess the problem of attrition."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Andrieu","ForeName":"Sandrine","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Inserm U558, Toulouse, France. sandrieu@cict.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coley","ForeName":"Nicola","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aisen","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carrillo","ForeName":"Maria C","Initials":"MC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"DeKosky","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Durga","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fillit","ForeName":"Howard","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Frisoni","ForeName":"Giovanni B","Initials":"GB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Froelich","ForeName":"Lutz","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gauthier","ForeName":"Serge","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Roy","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"J\u00f6nsson","ForeName":"Linus","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Khachaturian","ForeName":"Zaven","Initials":"Z"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morris","ForeName":"John C","Initials":"JC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orgogozo","ForeName":"Jean-Marc","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ousset","ForeName":"Pierre-Jean","Initials":"PJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Salmon","ForeName":"Eric","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sampaio","ForeName":"Cristina","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Gordon","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vellas","ForeName":"Bruno","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Animals"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"MEDLINE","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","QualifierName":["complications","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Prevention"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"166"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19221415","F3137183K48366G4","10.3233\/JAD-2009-0971"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19156699","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"06","Day":"18"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"06","Day":"16"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Association between cognition and daily life functioning in dementia subtypes.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"764-9"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.2193","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To investigate the association between cognition and daily life functioning in dementia subtypes.","Cross-sectional data were used from 615 patients with dementia who were referred to the Maastricht Memory Clinic of the Maastricht University Medical Centre.

These patients were classified as SUBJ (n = 23), nonamnestic MCI (naMCI; n = 17) and amnestic MCI (aMCI; n = 40) based on neuropsychology. Twenty healthy subjects formed the control (CTR) group. Volumetric regions of interest (VROI) analysis was performed in six associative cortical areas in each hemisphere. ANOVA for repeated measures, corrected for age and center, showed significant differences between groups (p = 0.01) and VROI (p < 0.0001) with a significant group-region interaction (p = 0.029). In the post hoc comparison, SUBJ did not differ from CTR. aMCI disclosed reduced uptake in the left hippocampus and bilateral temporal cortex (compared with CTR) or in the left hippocampus and bilateral parietal cortex (compared with SUBJ). In the naMCI group, reduced VROI values were found in the bilateral temporal cortex and right frontal cortex. In the comparison between aMCI and naMCI, the former had lower values in the left parietal cortex and precuneus. Discriminant analysis between SUBJ\/CTR versus all MCI patients allowed correct allocations in 73 % of cases. Mean VROI values were highly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the learning measure of a verbal memory test, especially in the bilateral precunei and parietal cortex and in the left hippocampus. In a subset of 70 patients, mean VROI values showed a significant correlation (p < 0.05) with the white matter hyperintensities score on MRI. In conclusion, MCI subtypes have different perfusion patterns. The aMCI group exhibited a pattern that is typical of early Alzheimer's disease, while the naMCI group showed a more anterior pattern of hypoperfusion. Instead, a homogeneous group effect was lacking in SUBJ."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nobili","ForeName":"Flavio","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinical

This can be done by developing support programs that minimize healthcare risks for the patients with dementia and their informal caregivers. Many support programs have been developed, and some of them are effective, but there has been no systematic review with a meta-analysis of all types of nonpharmacological support programs with odds of institutionalization or time to institutionalization as an outcome measure. A systematic review with a meta-analysis was therefore conducted to estimate the overall effectiveness of nonpharmacological support programs for caregivers and patients with dementia that are intended to delay institutionalization. Thirteen support programs with a total of 9,043 patients were included in the meta-analyses. The estimated overall effectiveness suggests that these programs significantly decrease the odds of institutionalization (odds ratio (OR)=0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.43-0.99, P=.05) and significantly increase the time to institutionalization (standardized mean difference (SMD)=1.44, 95% CI=0.07-2.81, P=.04). A meta-analysis of the best-quality studies still showed a positive significant result for the odds of institutionalization (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.43-0.85, P=.004), although the time to institutionalization was no longer significant (SMD=1.55, 95% CI=-0.35- 3.45, P=.11). The analysis of the intervention characteristics showed that actively involving caregivers in making choices about treatments distinguishes effective from ineffective support programs. Further investigation should be directed toward calculating the potential efficiency of these support programs by applying net-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spijker","ForeName":"Anouk","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Quality of Care Research, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Passive movement therapy (PMT) currently is the main physiotherapeutic intervention. General doubt about the beneficial effects of this widely used therapy necessitates a randomised clinical trial (RCT) to study the efficacy of PMT on the severity of paratonia and on the improvement of daily care.","A RCT with a 4-week follow-up period. Patients with dementia (according to the DSM-IV-TR Criteria) and moderate to severe paratonia are included in the study after proxy consent. By means of computerised and concealed block randomisation (block-size of 4) patients are included in one of two groups. The first group receives PMT, the second group receives usual care without PMT. PMT is given according to a protocol by physical therapist three times a week for four weeks in a row. The severity of paratonia (Modified Ashworth scale), the severity of the dementia (Global Deterioration Scale), the clinical improvement (Clinical Global Impressions), the difficulty in daily care (Patient Specific Complaints) and the experienced pain in daily care of the participant (PACSLAC-D) is assessed by assessors blind to treatment allocation at baseline, after 6 and 12 treatments. Success of the intervention is defined as a significant increase of decline on the modified Ashworth scale. The 'proportion of change' in two and four weeks time on this scale will be analysed. Also a multiple logistic regression analysis using declined\/not declined criteria as dependent variable with correction for relevant confounders (e.g. stage of dementia, medication, co-morbidity) will be used.","This study is the first RCT of this size to gain further insight on the effect of passive movement therapy on the severity of paratonia.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN43069940."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hobbelen","ForeName":"Johannes S M","Initials":"JS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Physiotherapy Research Vitalis WoonZorg groep Eindhoven, The Netherlands. hans.hobbelen@epid.unimaas.nl."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bor","ForeName":"Jacobus H J","Initials":"JH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Bie","ForeName":"Rob A","Initials":"RA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C M","Initials":"RT"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN43069940"}}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"19"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"100968548","ISSNLinking":"1471-2318"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["classification","complications"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Logistic Models"},{"DescriptorName":"Muscle Hypertonia","QualifierName":["classification","complications","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Musculoskeletal Manipulations","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"24"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"19"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"21","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"21","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18093298","1471-2318-7-30","10.1186\/1471-2318-7-30","PMC2257947"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon). 2001 Feb;16(2):87-101","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11222927"}},{"Citation":"Pain Manag Nurs. 2004 Mar;5(1):37-49","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14999652"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 1982 Sep;139(9):1136-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7114305"}},{"Citation":"Arch Neurol. 1993 Oct;50(10):1029-39","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8215960"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2008 Aug;20(4):840-52","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18177542"}},{"Citation":"J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol. 1997 Jul;10(3):93-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9322130"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2006;6:3","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16441889"}},{"Citation":"J Geriatr Phys Ther. 2006;29(2):50-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16914066"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2007 Jun;58(5):493-502","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17442027"}},{"Citation":"J Physiol. 1996 Dec 1;497 ( Pt 2):573-80","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8961197"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18042994","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"02","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"25","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2008"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Relationship between measures of dementia severity and observation of daily life functioning as measured with the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"81-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Cognitive impairment is mostly regarded as the core symptom of dementia, but several other domains (such as daily functioning) are equally relevant to assess the severity of dementia.

Dementia has a great impact on a person's well-being as well as on his or her social environment. Dealing with dementia raises moral issues and challenges for participants, especially for family members. One of the moral issues in the care for people with dementia is centred on responsibilities; how do people conceive and determine their responsibilities towards one another? To investigate this issue we use the theoretical perspective of Margaret Walker. She states that ideas about identity play a crucial role in patterns of normative expectations with regard to the distribution of responsibilities in daily practices of care. The results of this study show how the identity of a family-member is put under pressure and changes during her loved one's illness that leads to difficulties and misunderstandings concerning the issue of responsibility These results offer an insight into the complexities of actual practices of responsibility and highlight the importance for those caring for people with dementia of attending carefully to how they see themselves and how they see other people involved (Who am I? Who do I want to be for the other?). Answers to such questions show what people expect from themselves and from one another, and how they at any rate, are distributing responsibilities in a given situation. Professional caregivers should take into account that family members might have different ideas about who they are and consequently about what their responsibilities are."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goldsteen","ForeName":"Minke","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"RIAGG Midden Limburg, Minister Beverstraat 3, 6042 BL Roermond, The Netherlands. mgoldsteen@riaggmiddenlimburg.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Abma","ForeName":"Tineke","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oeseburg","ForeName":"Barth","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verkerk","ForeName":"Marian","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Widdershoven","ForeName":"Guy","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Bioethics","NlmUniqueID":"8704792","ISSNLinking":"0269-9702"},"CitationSubset":["E","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Family"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Responsibility"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":["etiology","psychology"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"28","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17845497","BIOT518","10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2007.00518.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17717417","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"11","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1420-8008","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2007"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Symptoms of preclinical dementia in general practice up to five years before dementia diagnosis.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"300-6"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To investigate which symptoms are indicative of preclinical dementia in general practice and whether subjects with preclinical dementia have an increased contact frequency with their general practitioner (GP).","Individuals with preclinical dementia (n = 75) and non-demented controls (n = 125) were selected from the Dutch GP registration network (RNH).

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the EQ-5D and the EQ-5D+C in elderly patients with cognitive impairments by assessing their construct validity and responsiveness.","Data from the MEDICIE study (n = 196) were used, in which all questionnaires were rated by proxies.","Regarding construct validity, we found similar correlations between the EQ-5D and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and between the EQ-5D+C and the MMSE.

Based on the results of this explorative study, it does not seem necessary to adjust the current classification system by adding a cognitive dimension. However, in order to compare both instruments regarding utility values, it is necessary to develop a new scoring algorithm for the EQ-5D+C by conducting a general population study. Considering the explorative nature of this study, it is recommended that more aspects of the validity of both the EQ-5D and the EQ-5D+C are explored in patients with cognitive impairments using a more

Low performance on a verbal memory task was related to a decrease in caregiver subjective competence and an increase in patient hyperactivity.","The results indicate that screening for cognitive impairment of spousal caregivers may be helpful, because suboptimal cognitive functioning may affect the ability to provide adequate care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Vugt","ForeName":"Marjolein E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, University of Maastricht, PO Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jolles","ForeName":"Jelle","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Osch","ForeName":"Liesbeth","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stevens","ForeName":"Fred","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aalten","ForeName":"Pauline","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lousberg","ForeName":"Richel","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Age Ageing","NlmUniqueID":"0375655","ISSNLinking":"0002-0729"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["psychology","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Case-Control Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Chi-Square Distribution"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Status"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Multivariate Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Spouses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Statistics, Nonparametric"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"complications"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"2","Day":"24","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"1","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"2","Day":"24","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16495293","35\/2\/160","10.1093\/ageing\/afj044"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16440403","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"14"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"The added value of a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosing dementia: a review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"223-32"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The impact of dementia constitutes a major public health challenge to our society. A multidisciplinary approach to dementia is generally recommended.","The objective of this review is to give an overview of the reported empirical studies on the added value of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing dementia, i.e. whether differences can be found between diagnostic multidisciplinary approaches, and\/or monodisciplinary ones with respect to the diagnostic outcomes, the impact of diagnostics and their effects on quality of life and costs.","Critical review of studies which involve a multidisciplinary assessment of dementia. Literature was systematically searched in a number of international databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Pubmed and EconLit). A first selection was based on screening titles by one author. Interrater reliability was determined by scoring all abstracts by two authors. The reliability of selecting full articles was based on scoring a random sample by two authors. Kappa values were calculated. The Kappa statistic (k) was also used as an indicator of the diagnostic agreement between single disciplines and multidisciplinary teams.","Five studies were identified as relevant for the purpose of this review. The most important outcome was the level of diagnostic agreement between single disciplines and multidisciplinary teams (MTs). Overall, there was substantial agreement (kappa: 0.37-0.76) on the diagnosis dementia (syndrome), but not on the subtypes (aetiology) (AD: 0.26-0.60; VD: 0.35-0.52; depression: 0.30-0.46). Diagnoses also differed between the disciplines.","Merely studies on diagnostic accuracy were found, all using different reference standards. Kappa values were chosen as outcome measure and every diagnosis was considered of equal value. Therefore, the added value could not definitively be demonstrated. However, the potential added value of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing dementia probably lies in the ability to differentiate among the subtypes of dementia and to detect comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression. Disciplines within an MT complement each other in establishing a specific diagnosis, which is considered to be the added value of such a multidisciplinary team."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wolfs","ForeName":"Claire A G","Initials":"CA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

There is a growing interest in BPSD as they are responsible for a large share of the suffering of patients and caregivers, and they strongly determine the patient's lifestyle and management. Better detection and understanding of these symptoms is essential to provide appropriate management. This article is a consensus produced by the behavioral group of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC). The aim of this article is to present clinical description and biological correlates of the major behavioral and psychological symptomatology in AD. BPSD is not a unitary concept. Instead, it should be divided into several symptoms or more likely: groups of symptoms, each possibly reflecting a different prevalence, course over time, biological correlate and psychosocial determinants. There is some clinical evidence for clusters within groups of BPSD. Biological studies indicate that patients with AD and BPSD are associated with variations in the pathological features (atrophy, brain perfusion\/metabolism, histopathology) when compared to people with AD without BPSD. An individually tailored approach taking all these aspects into account is warranted as it may offer more, and better, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment opportunities."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources & de Recherche, CHU, Hopital Pasteur, Universit\u00e9 de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, 30, Avenue de la Voie Romaine, 06002 Nice cedex 1, France. philippe.robert15@wanadoo.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Byrne","ForeName":"E Jane","Initials":"EJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hurt","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"De Deyn","ForeName":"Peter Paul","Initials":"PP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nobili","ForeName":"Flavio","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Riello","ForeName":"Roberta","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rodriguez","ForeName":"Guido","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Frisoni","ForeName":"Giovanni B","Initials":"GB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tsolaki","ForeName":"Magda","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kyriazopoulou","ForeName":"Nora","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bullock","ForeName":"Roger","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burns","ForeName":"Alistair","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vellas","ForeName":"Bruno","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2005","Month":"01","Day":"27"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Eur Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"9111820","ISSNLinking":"0924-9338"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aggression","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["blood supply","pathology","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebrovascular Circulation","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Consensus"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Evoked Potentials","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Psychomotor Agitation","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotic Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Societies, Medical"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2004","Month":"04","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2004","Month":"09","Day":"11"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16310680","S0924-9338(04)00257-3","10.1016\/j.eurpsy.2004.09.031"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16245958","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"01","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1170-229X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2005"}},"Title":"Drugs & aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Drugs Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"Antipsychotics for behavioural and psychological problems in elderly people with dementia: a systematic review of adverse events.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"845-58"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Although antipsychotics are important in the treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), they have moderate efficacy and often cause adverse events. Recent safety warnings about increased frequency of cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly patients who use atypical antipsychotics mean that physicians now face a dilemma when weighing the benefits and risks of use of antipsychotics in this patient group. This study systematically reviews the reporting of adverse events of antipsychotics used to treat BPSD in randomised, controlled trials (RCTs).","We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and CINAHL databases (search period 1980 or 1986-April 2005) and the Cochrane controlled trials register (2005) for RCTs that used intention-to-treat analysis to evaluate the efficacy and harms of antipsychotics used to treat BPSD. Two independent reviewers assessed the reporting of adverse events.","Screening of 930 abstracts identified 12 eligible RCTs (2809 patients). Most participants were elderly people (mean age 80 years) with Alzheimer's, vascular or mixed dementia. Studies lasted from 3 to 16 weeks. Adverse events, though common, were described heterogeneously and incompletely. No RCT fulfilled all Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials requirements for the reporting of harms. Atypical antipsychotics caused fewer extrapyramidal symptoms and less somnolence than typical antipsychotics, but these differences disappeared when dosages were increased. Only one trial reported cerebrovascular adverse events, with a number needed to harm of 14 (95% CI 8, 41).","At lower doses atypical antipsychotics may cause fewer adverse events in the treatment of BPSD, but there is uncertainty about their cerebrovascular safety profile.

The subjects were 58 out-patients with dementia and agitation. After baseline assessments and, if necessary, a period of wash-out of a previous antipsychotic drug, they were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of double-blind treatment with either olanzapine or haloperidol. The first 2 weeks were used for dose titration. Subsequently, the patients received a fixed dose of either olanzapine (average dose 4.71 mg) or haloperidol (average dose 1.75 mg) from day 14 to day 35. Both olanzapine and haloperidol decreased agitation significantly (decrease in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores), but there was no significant difference between the two drugs. The two drugs had comparable effects on all secondary outcome measures. They were well tolerated and had a similar side-effect pattern. Our study could not demonstrate the superiority of olanzapine, compared to haloperidol, for the treatment of agitation in patients with dementia.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2006 S.

Few studies have taken into account the possibility that specific behavioral problems may have differential effects on the decision to institutionalize the patient. Moreover, it is probably not patient behavior itself that causes nursing home placement (NHP), but caregivers' emotional reaction to it. The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of specific behavioral subsyndromes and caregivers' emotional reaction on NHP.","A total of 119 patients with dementia and their informal caregivers were followed up for 2 years. Time to NHP was measured in months from the date of the baseline interview to the date of NHP. Behavioral disturbances in the patient and caregivers' emotional reactions were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Cox regression analyses were used to determine the probability that caregivers would institutionalize the patient when patient behavioral problems or caregiver distress were present at baseline.","Forty-one percent of the patients were institutionalized during the 2-year follow-;up. Caregiver distress related to patient behavior was a significant predictor of NHP, while behavior in itself did not predict NHP. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a differential impact of specific aspects of problem behavior. Children caregivers, especially daughters, were associated with shorter time to NHP compared to spouses.","Our findings indicate that the caregiver's emotional reaction to patient behavior is more important than problem behaviors per se in the decision to institutionalize patients. Interventions aimed at teaching caregivers strategies to better manage difficult patient behaviors may provide caregivers with the necessary resources to continue care at home. Future interventions need to account for the specific needs and problems of different caregiver groups."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Vugt","ForeName":"Marjolein E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, University of Maastricht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stevens","ForeName":"Fred","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aalten","ForeName":"Pauline","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lousberg","ForeName":"Richel","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jaspers","ForeName":"Niek","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2005","Month":"09","Day":"27"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["psychology","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","epidemiology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":["epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Institutionalization"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Regression Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2004","Month":"08","Day":"09"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2005","Month":"03","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"9","Day":"28","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"4","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"9","Day":"28","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16185379","S1041610205002292","10.1017\/S1041610205002292"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16024400","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1360-7863","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"9","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Awareness in dementia: a review of clinical correlates.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"414-22"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This article provides a review of the literature on clinical correlates of awareness in dementia.

Within the ethical literature, hypotheses about the meaning of this drug for the patients have been formulated. This research aimed to investigate the experiences of caregivers of patients who used rivastigmine. The data have been collected by semi-structured interviews. The study included 12 caregivers of rivastigmine users. The--preliminary--results seem to indicate that theoretical considerations should be modified in the light of the experiences of caregivers. For example, problematic consequences of an early diagnosis and the creation of unreasonable hope did not appear in this study.

Patients received either donepezil (n = 142; 5 mg\/day for 28 days followed by 10 mg\/day according to the clinician's judgement) or placebo (n = 144). Unit costs were assessed in 1999 Swedish kronas (SEK) and converted to US dollars (USD). Donepezil-treated patients gained functional benefits relative to placebo on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (p = 0.042) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (p = 0.025) at week 52. Caregivers of donepezil-treated patients spent an average of 400 h less annually providing care than caregivers of placebo-treated patients. Mean annual healthcare costs were SEK 137,752 (USD 16,438) per patient for the donepezil group and SEK 135,314 (USD 16,147) in the placebo group. With the average annual cost of donepezil at SEK 10,723 (USD 1,280) per patient, the SEK 2,438 (USD 291) cost difference represented a 77% cost offset. When caregiver time and healthcare costs were included, mean annual costs were SEK 209,244 (USD 24,969) per patient in the donepezil group and SEK 218,434 (USD 26,066) in the placebo group, a total saving associated with donepezil treatment of SEK 9,190 (USD 1,097) per patient [95% CI of SEK -43,959 (USD -5,246), SEK 25,581 (USD 3,053); p = 0.6]. The positive effects on the efficacy outcome measures combined with no additional costs from a societal perspective indicate that donepezil is a cost-effective treatment, representing an improved strategy for the management of patients with AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2003 S.

The PAS combines six markers of preclinical AD, namely age, MMSE score, functional impairment, cognitive test performance, medial temporal lobe atrophy, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the PAS can accurately identify subjects with preclinical AD who become demented during a 2 or 5 year follow-up from among subjects with mild cognitive impairment for other reasons. We also investigated whether a step-wise scoring of the PAS could reduce the number of elaborate or expensive diagnostic procedures. The PAS was scored retrospectively in two independent samples of non-demented subjects with mild cognitive impairment older than 55 years (average age 65.6 years), who were selected from a memory clinic population. In the first sample, the follow-up was 5 years (5-year follow-up sample; n=69). In the second sample, the follow-up was 2 years (2-year follow-up sample; n=23). The PAS item medial temporal lobe atrophy was not scored in the 5-year follow-up sample. A PAS cut-off score of 4\/5 could best identify subjects with AD-type dementia at follow-up (n=25) in the 5-year follow-up sample with a sensitivity of 80% and a positive predictive value of 77%. A PAS cut-off score of 5\/6 could best identify subjects with AD-type dementia at follow-up (n=8) in the 2-year follow-up sample with a sensitivity of 88% and a positive predictive value of 70%. The positive predictive value could be increased to 94% in the 5-year follow-up sample and to 80% in the 2-year follow-up sample by using higher cut-off scores, but this reduced the sensitivity. Step-wise scoring of the PAS had the same diagnostic accuracy as the total PAS score and reduced the number of cognitive assessments by 22 to 38%, the number of assessments of medial temporal lobe atrophy by 57 to 74%, and the number of APOE genotypings by 74%. It is concluded that the PAS is a useful scale to identify subjects with preclinical AD who will become demented during the next 2 or 5 years. Step-wise scoring of the PAS can reduce the number of elaborate or expensive diagnostic procedures considerably."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Visser","ForeName":"Pieter Jelle","Initials":"PJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Institute of Brain and Behaviour, University of Maastricht, The Netherlands. pj.visser@np.unimaas.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scheltens","ForeName":"Philip","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cruts","ForeName":"Marc","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ponds","ForeName":"Rudolf W H M","Initials":"RW"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van Broeckhoven","ForeName":"Christine L","Initials":"CL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jolles","ForeName":"Jellemer","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Clinical Trial","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Germany","MedlineTA":"J Neurol","NlmUniqueID":"0423161","ISSNLinking":"0340-5354"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Predictive Value of Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"ROC Curve"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Assessment"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"5","Day":"8","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"26","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"5","Day":"8","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["11993532","10.1007\/s004150200011"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"11802238","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2002","Month":"03","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Characteristics of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"88-9"},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Visser","ForeName":"Pieter Jelle","Initials":"PJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ponds","ForeName":"Rudolf W H M","Initials":"RW"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jolles","ForeName":"Jellemer","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Letter"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"1","Day":"22","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"3","Day":"26","Hour":"10","Minute":"1"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"1","Day":"22","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["11802238","10.1002\/gps.511","10.1002\/gps.511"]}}}]}
