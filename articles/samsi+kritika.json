Framework analysis was used to analyse the data.","Four overarching challenges were identified: working with clients with dementia, including clients' sometimes unpredictable responses, communication difficulties, and mood changes; caring for the dying; conflict with family members; and working alone, which often left homecare workers at risk of exhaustion, fatigue, and a sense of isolation. When their work entailed high levels of emotion, such as a client's death or getting embroiled in a client's family conflict, they felt emotionally drained, under-prepared, and overwhelmed. Supportive elements include receiving encouragement and learning from experienced peers and their feelings being acknowledged by managers at their employing homecare agency. Some workers were offered time off or encouraged to attend the client's funeral as a means of supporting the process of bereavement.","Peer and manager support are essential and effective in coping with work pressures.

Policy ambitions to put people at the center of their own care are being developed internationally. These may be seen as part of the evolution of person-centered care which has its origins in critical perspectives on practice and social responses to people with dementia. In England, one further development of person-centered care has been personalization - a government policy to extend individuals' choice and control over their social care and, latterly, ways to meet their health care needs. This paper charts the evolution of the concept of person-centered care to the policy of personalization (which has international comparators) and summarizes emerging and conflicting evidence about the implications of personal budgets in England on older people with mental health problems such as dementia and their families. It focuses on the evidence base of personalization and on emerging lessons for practice, drawing from the implementation of personalization and the adoption of personal budgets by this group. While personalization may be one policy initiative, the values and practices of person-centered dementia care remain fundamental to practice and are inspiring new ideas related to rights and justice for people with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, NIHR School for Social Care, King's College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Samsi","ForeName":"Kritika","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, NIHR School for Social Care, King's College London, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Clin Interv Aging","NlmUniqueID":"101273480","ISSNLinking":"1176-9092"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care Planning","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","person-centered care","person-centered planning","personalization","personhood"]},"CoiStatement":"The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work."},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27932869","10.2147\/CIA.S104618","cia-11-1733","PMC5135058"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"J Aging Soc Policy. 2010 Jan;22(1):1-17","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20390709"}},{"Citation":"Dementia (London). 2016 Jan;15(1):125-40","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25280492"}},{"Citation":"J Ment Health. 2015 Aug;24(4):219-24","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26207416"}},{"Citation":"Australas J Ageing. 2012 Mar;31(1):47-51","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"22417154"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2016 Mar 07;16:63","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26951641"}},{"Citation":"Health Soc Care Community. 2013 Nov;21(6):563-81","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23465034"}},{"Citation":"Health Soc Care Community. 2016 Mar;24(2):165-74","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25684278"}},{"Citation":"BMC Med Educ. 2014 Dec 30;14:1044","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25547513"}},{"Citation":"BMC Health Serv Res. 2011 May 09;11:93","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21549010"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27131277","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"03","Day":"08"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"11"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1879-193X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"37","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Journal of aging studies","ISOAbbreviation":"J Aging Stud"},"ArticleTitle":"Living with uncertainty: Mapping the transition from pre-diagnosis to a diagnosis of dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"40-7"},"ELocationID":["10.1016\/j.jaging.2016.03.001","S0890-4065(15)30181-X"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Across the world, an early and timely diagnosis of dementia is seen to be a policy and practice imperative and a necessary step in order to live well with the condition. However, limited understanding exists regarding the personal and relational meanings attributed to the diagnostic experience. Drawn from the findings of a larger multi-site study conducted in four areas of England, this article presents a subset of the data where five participants and their carers and two people living alone initially presented themselves at a memory clinic for diagnostic testing, with this presentation eventually resulting in a confirmed, and shared, diagnosis of dementia. All 12 participants were interviewed at two time points in the study: at the time of first presentation to the memory clinic and shortly after the diagnosis had been shared with them. Informed by the grounded theory method, constant comparative analysis was applied to the data and this process resulted in a four-phase sequential model of diagnostic transition: (1) becoming self-aware\u2192seeking outside help; (2) being referred\u2192receiving a clinic appointment; (3) undergoing tests\u2192being told what's wrong; and (4) adjusting to the diagnosis\u2192negotiating everyday expectations. Running through each phase was the core category of 'living with uncertainty' which summarised the entire diagnostic journey for all study participants. Findings suggest a need for better awareness and information for people living with dementia at all phases and time points in the condition, which may be fostered by embedding these in early clinical encounters.

With an uncertain illness trajectory and unpredictable levels of deterioration and stability in symptoms, people with a diagnosis of dementia may live with uncertainty and anxiety and find it hard to make plans or decisions for their future. People with memory problems and caregivers seeking a diagnosis of dementia may also potentially find themselves navigating a labyrinth-like maze of services, practitioners, assessments, and memory tests, with limited understanding of test scores and little information about what support is available. In this context of uncertainty, the apparent clarity and certainty of a \"dementia care pathway\" may be attractive. However, the term \"dementia care pathway\" has multiple and overlapping meanings, which can potentially give rise to further confusion if these are ill-defined or a false consensus is presumed. This review distinguishes four meanings: 1) a mechanism for the management and containment of uncertainty and confusion, useful for the professional as well as the person with dementia; 2) a manual for sequencing care activities; 3) a guide to consumers, indicating eligibility for care activities, or a guide to self-management for dementia dyads, indicating the appropriateness of care activities; and 4) a manual for \"walking with\" the person. Examples of these approaches are presented from UK dementia services with illustrations of existing care pathways and associated time points, specifically focusing on: 1) early symptom identification and first service encounters, 2) assessment process, 3) diagnostic disclosure, 4) postdiagnostic support, and 5) appropriate interventions. We review the evidence around these themes, as well as discuss service pathways and referral routes used by some services in England and internationally. We conclude that the attraction of the term \"care pathway\" is seductive, but caution is needed in taking shared understandings for granted.

making of decisions in respect of people who have never had or have lost decision-making capacity. As part of a 5-year research program investigating the implementation and adoption of the Mental Capacity Act in dementia practice, we interviewed staff working in different care homes at two time points (32 staff at Time 1 in 2008 and 27 staff at Time 2 in 2012) in South East England. At baseline Time 1, daily practice seemed to resonate with Mental Capacity Act principles of respecting decisions and trying to act in a person's best interests. This paper reports Time 2 findings. We found that few care home staff interviewed specifically reported finding the Mental Capacity Act helpful in crystallizing the legal basis of their work. Most continued to offer illustrations of day-to-day practice in which they paid attention to individual choices, took account of the wishes of residents' families, and tried to act in residents' best interests but referred major decisions to their seniors. This study highlights the potential of referring to specific day-to-day practice in care homes when offering training or scrutinizing practice in dementia care more generally so that the work is set in its legal as well as moral framework. Care home staff in this study reported that advanced planning and pre-specifying preferences were more common among new care home residents, especially those with dementia, indicating that greater understanding of these is required by staff.

Some referenced Lawton's model (Dementia Quality of Life [DQOL] and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease [QOL-AD]), though these tapped part of this only; others claimed relationship to a health-related QoL concept (e.g. DEMQOL), though had less social relevance; others were based on limited domains (e.g. activity, affect) or clinical opinions (Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia [QUALID]). Many measures were based on proxy assessments or observations of people with dementia's QoL, rather than their own ratings. The Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID) was developed involving people with dementia and caregivers, but excluded some of their main themes. All measures were tested on selective samples only (ranging from community to hospital clinics, or subsamples\/waves of existing population surveys), in a few sites.

Implemented in 2007, the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) provides opportunities for assisting with planning and making decisions on others' behalf, and may be expected to be entrenched within clinical practice. We conducted follow-up qualitative interviews with 15 community-based dementia nurses to detect changes and developments in views and practices of the MCA. Thematic analysis identified recurrent themes and developed into a coding framework. At Time2, there was greater awareness of general and specific principles of MCA and greater confidence in using it. There was greater involvement in discussing planning finances, less so in end-of-life-care. Some participants were concerned about lack of understanding amongst other professionals and felt more public awareness was required. Supplementary training, opportunities for mentoring and supervision may develop greater confidence among dementia practitioners and support their roles in informing and advising people with dementia and carers.

The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (England and Wales) provides a legal framework to safeguard the rights of people with dementia to make their own decisions for as long as possible. The impact of this on long-term planning has been investigated; everyday decision-making in people's own homes remains unexplored.","Using a phenomenological approach, we interviewed 12 dyads (one person with dementia + one carer) four times over one year to ascertain experience of decision-making, how decisions were negotiated, and how dynamics changed. Qualitative interviews were conducted in people's own homes, and thematic analysis was applied to transcripts.","Respecting autonomy, decision-specificity and best interests underlay most everyday decisions in this sample. Over time, dyads transitioned from supported decision-making, where person with dementia and carer made decisions together, to substituted decision-making, where carers took over much decision-making. Points along this continuum represented carers' active involvement in retaining their relative's engagement through providing cues, reducing options, using retrospective information, and using the best interests principle.

Only papers published after 2003 were included.","Of the 35 papers included in the review, only one study observed the process of disclosure and only two papers explored the effects on the person with dementia's health. The vast majority of people with dementia wished to know their diagnosis. The key challenges for the person with dementia were coming to terms with losses on multiple levels. Although there may be short-term distress, the majority of people with dementia do not appear to experience long-term negative effects on their psychological health. For family carers, becoming the main decision-maker and adjusting to increased responsibility were common concerns.","There is still little empirical research observing the process of diagnostic disclosure in dementia.
