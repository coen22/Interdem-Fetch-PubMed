Based on a face-to-face intervention program, we adapted and designed a Web-based fully automated psychoeducational program (called Diapason) inspired by a cognitive approach.","This study aimed to evaluate through a pilot unblinded randomized controlled trial the efficacy and acceptability of a Web-based psychoeducational program for informal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease (PWAD) based on a mixed methods research design.","We recruited and randomized offline 49 informal caregivers of a PWAD in a day care center in Paris, France. They either received the Web-based intervention and usual care for 3 months (experimental group, n=25) or only usual care (control group, n=24). Caregivers' perceived stress (PSS-14, primary outcome), self-efficacy, burden, perceived health status, and depression (secondary outcomes) were measured during 3 face-to-face on-site visits: at baseline, at the end of the program (month 3), and after follow-up (month 6). Additionally, semistructured interviews were conducted with experimental group caregivers at month 6 and examined with thematic analysis.","Intention-to-treat analysis did not show significant differences in self-perceived stress between the experimental and control groups (P=.98). The experimental group significantly improved their knowledge of the illness (d=.79, P=.008) from baseline to month 3. Of the 25 participants allocated to the experimental group, 17 (71%) finished the protocol and entirely viewed at least 10 of 12 online sessions. On average, participants used the website 19.72 times (SD 12.88) and were connected for 262.20 minutes (SD 270.74). The results of the satisfaction questionnaire showed that most participants considered the program to be useful (95%, 19\/20), clear (100%, 20\/20), and comprehensive (85%, 17\/20). Significant correlations were found between relationship and caregivers' program opinion (P=.01). Thus, positive opinions were provided by husbands and sons (3\/3), whereas qualified opinions were primarily reported by daughters (8\/11). Female spouses expressed negative (2\/3) or neutral opinions (1\/3). Caregivers expected more dynamic content and further interaction with staff and peers.","In this study, quantitative results were inconclusive owing to small sample size. Qualitative results indicated\/showed little acceptance of the program and high expectations from caregivers. Caregivers did not rule out their interest in this kind of intervention provided that it met their needs. More dynamic, personalized, and social interventions are desirable. Our recruitment issues pointed out the necessity of in-depth studies about caregivers' help-seeking behaviors and readiness factors.","Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01430286;

Literature results show a wide variability in attitudes and clinicalpractice, and diagnosis seems to be more often disclosed to caregivers than to patients. The objective of this study was to examine whether and how diagnosis of AD is disclosed in French general practice and which issues are addressed with the patient. A questionnaire was sent via mail to 1,629 general practitioners (GPs), 1,105 belonging to the Sentinel's network and 524 specially recruited doctors practicing in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region. A total of 631 questionnaires were returned (response rate, 39 percent), of which 616 were eligible for analysis. Twenty-eight percent of GPs reported having disclosed diagnosis to the patient (25 percent mentioned \"Alzheimer's disease\"), whereas 88 percent considered it their role to announce the diagnosis to the patient. Regarding the type of information provided to the patient, only 25 percent discussed the nature of the illness, 23 percent behavioral problems, and 47 percent depression, mainly for psychological reasons (63 percent). Stress was discussed with 79 percent of the caregivers. We concluded that GPs do not discuss the consquences of AD and symptoms (e.g., behavioral disorders) with patients, mainly for psychological reasons, whereas they have a less-reluctant attitude toward caregivers. As the GP has the weighty task of providing ropriate community care and psychological support to the patient, it is of utmost importance to reflect on how disclosure of diagnosis can be facilitated."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cantegreil-Kallen","ForeName":"Inge","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatrics, Broca Hospital, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Turbelin","ForeName":"Cl\u00e9ment","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Olaya","ForeName":"Emile","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Blanchon","ForeName":"Thierry","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moulin","ForeName":"Florence","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rigaud","ForeName":"Anne-Sophie","Initials":"AS"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Flahault","ForeName":"Antoine","Initials":"A"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen","NlmUniqueID":"101082834","ISSNLinking":"1533-3175"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"France"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Truth Disclosure"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"9","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"9","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16136846","10.1177\/153331750502000404"]}}}]}
