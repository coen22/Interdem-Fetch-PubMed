Further, despite critiques in the United Kingdom, the LCP continues to be used in the Netherlands, while, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted since its implementation. The purpose of the present study was to analyze professional caregivers' experiences with the LCP in this context.","This article draws on an ethnographic study. Data collection was based on 4 months of ethnographic fieldwork in 2015 in 11 psychogeriatric units of a nursing home in a rural area of the Netherlands. Data collection included participant observation and 25 semistructured audiotaped interviews with specialist elderly care physicians, nursing staff, and a nurse practitioner.","We found that professional caregivers appreciate the LCP as a communication tool and as a reminder of care goals. However, the document was deemed too complicated and to cause duplication of work. It was also reported that the LCP did not cover the complexity of care needs that emerge in practice. Actual care needs were prioritized over the LCP, which calls its contribution into question.","Overall, the LCP does not match the context of dementia care in the nursing home. While it could be argued that the LCP does not intend to replace good care, its benefits as a reminder and a communication tool need continued consideration in relation to the amount of work it requires as a bureaucratic obligation."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lemos Dekker","ForeName":"Natashe","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Amsterdam Institute for Social Science Research,University of Amsterdam,Amsterdam,The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gysels","ForeName":"Marjolein","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Social Science and Global Health,University of Amsterdam,Amsterdam,The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der Steen","ForeName":"Jenny T","Initials":"JT","Identifier":"0000-0002-9063-7501","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care,Leiden University Medical Center,Leiden,The Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Palliat Support Care","NlmUniqueID":"101232529","ISSNLinking":"1478-9515"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Anthropology, Cultural","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatrics","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Guidelines as Topic","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":["organization & administration","trends"]}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","Ethnography","Liverpool Care Pathway","Nursing home","Professional caregivers"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"3","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28693652","S1478951517000645","10.1017\/S1478951517000645"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28104596","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1468-2834","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"46","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"01"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"Operationalising ethical challenges in dementia research-a systematic review of current evidence.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"678-687"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/ageing\/afw250","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["the worldwide number of dementia cases is increasing, and this is a trend that is expected to continue as a growing proportion of the population ages. However, conducting research with persons suffering from dementia can be fraught due to fears surrounding research risks in vulnerable populations. This can make seeking approval for studies difficult. As research directly involving persons with dementia is key for the development of evidence-based best practice, the development of a coherent ethical strategy to perform such research feasibly and effectively is of paramount importance.","this paper aims to review and synthesise ethical challenges in performing research with persons who have dementia.","in undertaking a systematic review of the current research literature, we will identify the central issues and arguments characterising research that concerns the ethical dimensions of research participation in the dementia population. Data were analysed using both inductive and deductive content analysis. Ethical considerations in research involving persons with dementia primarily concern the representation of the interests of the person with dementia and protection of their vulnerabilities and rights.","a total of 2,894 results were returned from initial searches, following deduplication. In total, 2,458 were excluded at title review, and following abstract review 158 papers remained; 29 papers were included for analysis after full paper review and data extraction. Papers ranged between 1995 and 2013.","this review has highlighted a lack of consensus in current research and guidelines addressing these concerns; a clear stance on ethical governance of studies is important for future research and best evidence-based practice in dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author 2017.
