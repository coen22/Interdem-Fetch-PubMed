A total of 43 AD patients with mild to moderate disease severity were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n\u2009=\u200922, MMMSE\u2009=\u200920.77), or a control group (n\u2009=\u200921, MMMSE\u2009=\u200919.24). The intervention group received one weekly group-based session of IRT for five weeks in an authentic 1950s style museum environment, matching the time of the participants' youth. IRT included semi-structured conversations about the past. The control group received standard care. We assessed performance on cognitive function and autobiographical memory at baseline and post-intervention. Five weeks of IRT enhanced subsequent autobiographical memory performance, when participants were cued by concrete objects dated to their youth. Object-cued memories reported post intervention included a significantly higher degree of episodic details and higher word counts. The intervention showed no effect on the Autobiographical Memory Interview or word-cued recall. Global cognitive function and semantic autobiographical memory performance increased across time for both groups. Our findings demonstrate that immersion into a setting, rich on concrete cues dated to the participants' youth can improve autobiographical remembering."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kirk","ForeName":"Marie","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences , Aarhus University , Aarhus C , Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rasmussen","ForeName":"Katrine Willemoes","Initials":"KW","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences , Aarhus University , Aarhus C , Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Overgaard","ForeName":"Susanne Bollerup","Initials":"SB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences , Aarhus University , Aarhus C , Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Berntsen","ForeName":"Dorthe","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences , Aarhus University , Aarhus C , Denmark."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"09","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Memory","NlmUniqueID":"9306862","ISSNLinking":"0965-8211"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cues"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory, Episodic"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Status and Dementia Tests","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","Autobiographical memory","cognitive stimulation","episodic memory","immersive reminiscence therapy","object-cueing"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"5","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30198380","10.1080\/09658211.2018.1515960"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30047758","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1931-1559","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"32","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Neuropsychology","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuropsychology"},"ArticleTitle":"The life span distribution of autobiographical memory in Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"906-919"},"ELocationID":"10.1037\/neu0000486","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The literature on the temporal distribution of autobiographical memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by mixed findings concerning the presence of a temporal gradient in the loss of autobiographical memory.

However, this deficit tends to spare memories dated to earlier parts of their lives, and may partially reflect retrieval deficits rather than complete memory loss. Introducing a novel paradigm, the present study examines whether autobiographical memory recall can be improved in AD by manipulating the sensory richness, concreteness and cultural dating of the memory cues. Specifically, we examine whether concrete everyday objects historically dated to the participants' youth (e.g., a skipping rope), relative to verbal cues (i.e., the verbal signifiers for the objects) facilitate access to autobiographical memories. The study includes 49 AD patients, and 50 healthy, older matched control participants, all tested on word versus object-cued recall. Both groups recalled significantly more memories, when cued by objects relative to words, but the advantage was significantly larger in the AD group. In both groups, memory descriptions were longer and significantly more episodic in nature in response to object-cued recall. Together these findings suggest that the multimodal nature of the object cues (i.e. vision, olfaction, audition, somatic sensation) along with specific cue characteristics, such as time reference, texture, shape, may constrain the retrieval search, potentially minimizing executive function demands, and hence strategic processing requirements, thus easing access to autobiographical memories in AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
