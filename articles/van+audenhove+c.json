However, nursing home staff, residents and their families feel uncomfortable to start this type of conversation, resulting in unknown (care) preferences. 'We DECide optimized' will provide tools to nursing home staff for discussing advance care planning. The primary objective is to enhance the level of shared decision-making in advance care planning conversations. We hypothesize that the training will enhance the perception of the importance, competence and frequency in which participants engage in advance care planning conversations. The secondary objective is to assess barriers and facilitators in the implementation of advance care planning policies at the ward level.","'We DECide optimized' will consist of two four-hour workshops and a homework assignment between sessions. Training components will include information on advance care planning and shared decision-making, role-play exercises and group discussions on implementation barriers at the ward level. Participating wards will receive supporting materials to stimulate residents and their families to initiate conversations. The study uses a cluster randomized controlled design, with 65 Flemish nursing home wards taking part (311 staff members). Data will be collected through a pretest-posttest model, with measurements up to 9\u2009months after training. The RE-AIM framework will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation. Quantitative and qualitative data at the clinical, organizational and resident level will be collected.","This study describes a hands-on, in-depth and multi-level training approach to improve shared decision-making in advance care planning conversations. By providing tools to ward staff, engaging the management and informing residents and their families, 'We DECide optimized' aims to decrease evidence-based barriers and to provide all stakeholders with incentives to engage in conversations about (care) preferences in an informative and participatory manner."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goossens","ForeName":"Bart","Initials":"B","Identifier":"0000-0003-1895-5764","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"LUCAS,

Although little is known about the prevalence and not every person with dementia struggles with it, nighttime restlessness puts a heavy burden on the persons themselves and their caregivers.This field study explores nighttime restlessness in nursing homes based on two research questions: (1) What is nighttime restlessness according to professional caregivers? and (2) How is nighttime restlessness managed?Data were collected through diaries, interviews with caregivers and one night of observation in eight nursing homes.Wandering and screaming seem to be the most prevalent nighttime agitated behaviours. Caregivers identify many possible causes, but spatial and sensory factors, such as light or noise, were rarely mentioned spontaneously. The observations highlighted that a lot of light and noise is prominent and this might be causing nighttime restlessness.Caregivers try several strategies: for example talking with the resident, put on a light and apply medication or physical restraints.The management of nighttime restlessness requires a holistic approach. Caregivers' attention for and efforts to ameliorate the spatial and sensory environment in the management of nighttime restlessness are limited.

family carer and a patient. Besides clarifying the quality of the caregiving relationship in two populations of chronically ill patients, this investigation examines whether patient characteristics, carer characteristics and network characteristics are predictive of relationship quality in dementia caregiving. Partners, children or children-in-law caring for a relative suffering from dementia (N = 144) and partners or parents of persons suffering from chronic mental illness (N = 77) were interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire. The measurement of relationship quality is based on the literature of Expressed Emotion and covers two dimensions: the level of criticism and the level of warmth. In general, the relationship between a carer and his or her chronically ill relative was marked by a low level of conflict or criticism and a high degree of warmth. The main predictors of a poorer relationship quality were disturbances in the patient's behaviour and the carer's perception of these disturbances. Our results suggest that, rather than limiting investigations to the burden experienced by the family carer, future research and interventions on chronically ill patients should focus on the quality of the carer-patient relationship and its determinants."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spruytte","ForeName":"Nele","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"LUCAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. nele.spruytte@med.kuleuven.ac.be"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van Audenhove","ForeName":"Chantal","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lammertyn","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Storms","ForeName":"Gerrit","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Psychol Psychother","NlmUniqueID":"101135751","ISSNLinking":"1476-0835"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Chronic Disease"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"10","Day":"25","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"28","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"10","Day":"25","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12396755","10.1348\/147608302320365208"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"11748770","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2002","Month":"02","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2001","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Predictors of institutionalization of cognitively-impaired elderly cared for by their relatives.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1119-28"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for nursing home placement of cognitively-impaired elderly, with special attention to the role of psychosocial factors such as the caregiver's preference for institutionalization and the quality of the dyadic relationship.","Partners, children and children-in-law caring for a relative suffering from dementia (n = 144) were interviewed at home. Sociodemographic variables, patient characteristics, characteristics of the caregiving situation, caregiver characteristics, the support with care and the quality of the caregiving relationship are included as predictors of the caregiver's preference for institutionalization and of the actual institutionalization six to nine months later. Data are analyzed using multiple (logistic) regression analyses.","The hypothesis that a poor quality of the relationship, besides other determinants, will be predictive of institutionalization received partial support. No relationship is found between the premorbid relationship quality and institutionalization (preference and actual). However, a good current relationship between the caregiver and the patient reduced the risk of nursing home placement. Institutionalization rate was 16.5% and it was predicted by the caregiver's preference for institutionalization, the functional level of the patient, the quality of the current relationship and the performance of accommodation changes at home.","Research and interventions directed at delaying or preventing institutionalization should pay more attention to the role of psychosocial aspects in the process of nursing home placement. Specifically the relationship quality in terms of criticism or warmth might be a critical factor in the continuation of home care."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spruytte","ForeName":"N","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"LUCAS-K.U.Leuven, Belgium.
