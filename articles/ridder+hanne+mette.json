The purpose of this scoping review was to investigate (1) how manuals published in refereed journals explaining procedures of complex interventions in dementia care are structured and their content disseminated and (2) to provide recommendations for future manuals.","A systematic search was conducted using four databases (Embase, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Scopus) following PRISMA-ScR and PICo method. The results were analysed using template analysis aiming to describe the possibility of tailoring the intervention, degree of flexibility of the manual and dissemination elements used in the manual.","A total\u00a0of\u00a0882 records were identified, and 86 full-text articles were assessed. Nine articles containing manuals met the inclusion criteria. All of the included manuals allowed the user to tailor actions in the intervention to specific situations. Two-thirds of the manuals showed a medium degree of flexibility. The types of dissemination elements varied. All used written text, and some used various graphical organisers such as headlines and lists. None used illustrations or audio\/video material.","Currently, only few manuals for complex interventions in the field of dementia are published in refereed journals, all disseminated as written text. For future manuals, we suggest considering the inclusion of illustrations and\/or audio\/video material to describe actions, to allow for tailoring of the intervention, and to maintain a medium or low degree of flexibility by structuring the content hierarchically in phases while providing the user with detailed description of what to do, and how to decide what to."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2020 Anderson-Ingstrup and Ridder."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Anderson-Ingstrup","ForeName":"Jens","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0001-5709-3664","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Communication and Psychology, Doctoral Programme in Music Therapy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ridder","ForeName":"Hanne Mette","Initials":"HM","Identifier":"0000-0002-3204-5997","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Communication and Psychology, Doctoral Programme in Music Therapy, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"13"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Clin Interv Aging","NlmUniqueID":"101273480","ISSNLinking":"1176-9092"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Information Dissemination"},{"DescriptorName":"Manuals as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Periodicals as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["complex intervention","dementia","ecopsychosocial intervention","manual-based intervention","nonpharmacological intervention"]},"CoiStatement":"Mr Jens Anderson-Ingstrup report grants from Velux Foundations, during the conduct of the study.

Music interventions such as group music therapy (GMT) and recreational choir singing (RCS) have shown promising effects, but their comparative effectiveness across clinical subgroups is unknown. This trial aims to determine effectiveness of GMT, RCS and their combination for care home residents and to examine heterogeneity of treatment effects across subgroups.","This large, pragmatic, multinational cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 2\u00d72\u2009factorial design will compare the effects of GMT, RCS, both or neither, for care home residents aged 65 years or older with dementia and depressive symptoms. We will randomise 100 care home units with \u22651000 residents in total across eight countries. Each intervention will be offered for 6 months (3 months 2 times\/week followed by 3 months 1 time\/week), with extension allowed if locally available. The primary outcome will be the change in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning, neuropsychiatric symptoms, psychotropic drug use, caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality and costs over at least 12 months. The study has 90% power to detect main effects and is also powered to determine interaction effects with gender, severity and socioeconomic status.","Ethical approval has been obtained for one country and will be obtained for all countries.

Care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"255-279"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/jmt\/thy012","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Public interest in the benefits of music for people with dementia has rapidly increased in recent years. In addition to clinical work with clients, music therapists are often required to support and train staff, families, and volunteers and skill-share some music therapeutic skills. Six music therapy researchers from six countries agreed it was timely to organize a roundtable and share their indirect music therapy practice and examples of skill-sharing in dementia care. This article was developed following the roundtable at the World Congress of Music Therapy in 2017 and further discussion among the authors. This process highlighted the diversity and complexity of indirect music therapy practice and skill-sharing, but some common components emerged, including: 1) the importance of making clinical decisions about when direct music therapy is necessary and when indirect music therapy is appropriate, 2) supporting the transition from direct music therapy to indirect music therapy, 3) the value of music therapy skill-sharing in training care home staff, 4) the need for considering potential risks and burdens of indirect music therapy practice, and 5) expanding the role of music therapist and cultivating cross-professional dialogues to support organizational changes. In indirect music therapy practice, a therapist typically works with carers and supporters to strengthen their relationships with people with dementia and help them further develop their self-awareness and sense of competence. However, the ultimate goal of indirect music therapy practice in dementia care remains the wellbeing of people living with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McDermott","ForeName":"Orii","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Nottingham and Aalborg University."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ridder","ForeName":"Hanne Mette","Initials":"HM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Aalborg University."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baker","ForeName":"Felicity Anne","Initials":"FA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Melbourne."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wosch","ForeName":"Thomas","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ray","ForeName":"Kendra","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"MJHS."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stige","ForeName":"Brynjulf","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bergen."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Music Ther","NlmUniqueID":"0014162","ISSNLinking":"0022-2917"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Music"},{"DescriptorName":"Music Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Family Relations"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30053091","5056495","10.1093\/jmt\/thy012"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24524811","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"26","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"A preliminary psychometric evaluation of Music in Dementia Assessment Scales (MiDAS).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1011-9"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610214000180","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Music in Dementia Assessment Scales (MiDAS), an observational outcome measure for music therapy with people with moderate to severe dementia, was developed from qualitative data of focus groups and interviews.
