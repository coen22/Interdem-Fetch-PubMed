with 29 homecare workers and 13 homecare managers in England. Framework analysis was used to analyse the data.","Four overarching challenges were identified: working with clients with dementia, including clients' sometimes unpredictable responses, communication difficulties, and mood changes; caring for the dying; conflict with family members; and working alone, which often left homecare workers at risk of exhaustion, fatigue, and a sense of isolation. When their work entailed high levels of emotion, such as a client's death or getting embroiled in a client's family conflict, they felt emotionally drained, under-prepared, and overwhelmed. Supportive elements include receiving encouragement and learning from experienced peers and their feelings being acknowledged by managers at their employing homecare agency. Some workers were offered time off or encouraged to attend the client's funeral as a means of supporting the process of bereavement.","Peer and manager support are essential and effective in coping with work pressures. There is a need to develop models of effective support to alleviate staff's practical, emotional, and interpersonal pressures.

These challenges may include assessment and management of difficulties with eating and swallowing, responding to agitation, treating pain, and managing recurrent infections. Practitioners sometimes lack both confidence in making end of life decisions and guidance. This study developed an alternative to lengthy guidelines, in the form of heuristics which were tested in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to test the usability and acceptability of a set of heuristics which could be used by practitioners providing EOLC for people with dementia in a variety of clinical and care settings.","A three phase co-design process was adopted: 1) Synthesis of evidence and outputs from interviews and focus groups with family carers and practitioners, by a co-design group, to develop heuristics; 2) Testing of the heuristics in five clinical or care settings for six months; 3) Evaluation of the heuristics at three and six months using qualitative individual and group interviews.","Four heuristics were developed covering: eating and swallowing difficulties, agitation and restlessness, reviewing treatment and interventions at the end of life, and providing routine care. The five sites reported that the heuristics were simple and easy to use, comprehensive, and made implicit, tacit knowledge explicit. Four themes emerged from the qualitative evaluation: authority and permission; synthesis of best practice; providing a structure and breaking down complexity; and reassurance and instilling confidence.","Use of heuristics is a novel approach to end of life decision making in dementia which can be useful to both experienced and junior members of staff making decisions. Heuristics are a practical tool which could overcome a lack of care pathways and direct guidance in end of life care for people with

The factors leading to the timing of the decision remain particularly unclear. This systematic review of existing literature aims to gain an understanding of the decision-making timing and process to distinguish the drivers of these decisions, and to identify if there is an \"optimal\" or best time (if any) for a person with dementia to move to a care home.","Six English language electronic databases were searched up to the end of 2016, along with included papers' reference lists. Papers were screened against the inclusion criteria and rated for quality. Extracted data were thematically analyzed.","The review identified 16 relevant papers. Seven themes were identified: (1) what happened before the move; (2) planning for the move, (3) weighing up the decision, (4) lack of support, (5) drivers of the decision, (6) emotional significance of the move, and (7) continued reflection on the decision. \"Time\" of the move was largely absent from much of the literature, although inferences were made. Overall, the decision-making process appeared to be cyclic, with family carers constantly re-evaluating when might be the time to make the move with some continuing to reflect on this even subsequently.","Further research is required to understand the \"optimal\" or best time (if any) for when a person with dementia moves to a care home, and how to determine when someone is ready to move."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cole","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit,King's College London,London,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Samsi","ForeName":"Kritika","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit,King's College London,London,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit,King's College London,London,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"04","Day":"18"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Transfer"},{"DescriptorName":"Terminal Care"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["care home","care-transition","carers","decision-making","dementia","review"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"4","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"4","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29667568","S1041610218000364","10.1017\/S1041610218000364"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29557193","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"02","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"11"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"7-8","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2019 Oct-Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in community dwelling older people with dementia: 2.

dementia but there are many concerns about the quality of care and support they receive. Consequently there have been numerous calls for hospital staff to have dementia training. While cleaning or domestic staff and porters form considerable parts of the hospital workforce they are infrequently considered in discussions of dementia care training and practice. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the experiences of domestic staff and porters working in an acute hospital setting who are in contact regularly with patients with dementia. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken in 2016 with seven domestic staff and five porters in one English acute hospital to investigate their views and experiences. Data were analysed thematically by constant comparison technique and theoretical sampling. Themes were identified and realistic concepts developed. Participants observed that caring attitudes and behaviour in their encounters with patients with dementia are important but challenging to put into practice. Several would have valued more information about dementia. Some noted situations in the hospital stay that seemed particularly difficult for patients with dementia such as travelling to different parts of the hospital for treatments. The study suggests the need for improving the dementia-related knowledge and skills of all non-clinical staff especially those new to the NHS. The impact of witnessing dementia symptoms and distress on emotional well-being requires further research so that ancillary staff can improve the hospital stay of patients with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ashton","ForeName":"Caroline","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Lister Ward, Princess Alexandra Hospital, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"05","Day":"02"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Allied Health Personnel","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Grounded Theory"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Education"},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitals"},{"DescriptorName":"Housekeeping, Hospital"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Inpatients","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ancillary staff","cleaners","dementia","education","hospital","porters","training","well-being"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"5","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28463027","10.1177\/1471301217707085"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28358269","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Gaps in Understanding the Experiences of Homecare Workers Providing Care for People with Dementia up to the End of Life: A Systematic Review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"970-989"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301217699354","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This systematic review of the literature explores the perspectives and experiences of homecare workers providing care for people with dementia living at home up to the end of life. A search of major English language databases in 2016 identified 378 studies on the topic, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. No empirical research was identified that specifically addressed the research question. However, synthesis of the findings from the broader literature revealed three overarching themes: value of job role, emotional labour and poor information and communication. The role of homecare workers supporting a person with dementia up to the end of life remains under-researched, with unmet needs for informational, technical and emotional support reported.

Policy ambitions to put people at the center of their own care are being developed internationally. These may be seen as part of the evolution of person-centered care which has its origins in critical perspectives on practice and social responses to people with dementia. In England, one further development of person-centered care has been personalization - a government policy to extend individuals' choice and control over their social care and, latterly, ways to meet their health care needs. This paper charts the evolution of the concept of person-centered care to the policy of personalization (which has international comparators) and summarizes emerging and conflicting evidence about the implications of personal budgets in England on older people with mental health problems such as dementia and their families. It focuses on the evidence base of personalization and on emerging lessons for practice, drawing from the implementation of personalization and the adoption of personal budgets by this group. While personalization may be one policy initiative, the values and practices of person-centered dementia care remain fundamental to practice and are inspiring new ideas related to rights and justice for people with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, NIHR School for Social Care, King's College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Samsi","ForeName":"Kritika","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, NIHR School for Social Care, King's College London, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Clin Interv Aging","NlmUniqueID":"101273480","ISSNLinking":"1176-9092"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care Planning","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","person-centered care","person-centered planning","personalization","personhood"]},"CoiStatement":"The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work."},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27932869","10.2147\/CIA.S104618","cia-11-1733","PMC5135058"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"J Aging Soc Policy. 2010 Jan;22(1):1-17","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20390709"}},{"Citation":"Dementia (London). 2016 Jan;15(1):125-40","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25280492"}},{"Citation":"J Ment Health. 2015 Aug;24(4):219-24","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26207416"}},{"Citation":"Australas J Ageing. 2012 Mar;31(1):47-51","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"22417154"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2016 Mar 07;16:63","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26951641"}},{"Citation":"Health Soc Care Community. 2013 Nov;21(6):563-81","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23465034"}},{"Citation":"Health Soc Care Community. 2016 Mar;24(2):165-74","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25684278"}},{"Citation":"BMC Med Educ. 2014 Dec 30;14:1044","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25547513"}},{"Citation":"BMC Health Serv Res. 2011 May 09;11:93","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21549010"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27916749","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"06","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1468-2834","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"46","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"05","Day":"01"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"Inequalities in receipt of mental and physical healthcare in people with dementia in the UK.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"393-400"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/ageing\/afw208","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["UK Dementia Strategies prioritise fair access to mental and physical healthcare.

practitioners; such as, providing care if there are swallowing difficulties. This study aimed to develop a toolkit of heuristics (rules-of-thumb) to aid practitioners making end-of-life care decisions for people with dementia.","An iterative co-design approach was adopted using a literature review and qualitative methods, including; 1) qualitative interviews and focus groups with family carers and 2) focus groups with health and care professionals. Family carers were recruited from a national charity, purposively sampling those with experience of end-of-life care for a person with dementia. Health and care professionals were purposively sampled to include a broad range of expertise including; general practitioners, palliative care specialists, and geriatricians. A co-design group was established consisting of health and social care experts and family carers, to synthesise the findings from the qualitative work and produce a toolkit of heuristics to be tested in practice.","Four broad areas were identified as requiring complex decisions at the end of life; 1) eating\/swallowing difficulties, 2) agitation\/restlessness, 3) ending life-sustaining treatment, and 4) providing \"routine care\" at the end of life. Each topic became a heuristic consisting of rules arranged into flowcharts. Eating\/swallowing difficulties have three rules; ensuring eating\/swallowing difficulties do not come as a surprise, considering if the situation is an emergency, and considering 'comfort feeding' only versus time-trialled artificial feeding. Agitation\/restlessness encourages a holistic approach, considering the environment, physical causes, and the carer's wellbeing. Ending life-sustaining treatment supports practitioners through a process of considering the benefits of treatment versus quality-of-life and comfort. Finally, a heuristic on providing routine care such as bathing, prompts practitioners to consider adapting the delivery of care, in order to promote comfort and dignity at the end of life.","The heuristics are easy to use and remember, offering a novel approach to decision making for dementia end-of-life care. They have the potential to be used alongside existing end-of-life care recommendations, adding more readily available practical assistance. This is the first study to synthesise experience and existing evidence into easy-to-use heuristics for dementia end-of-life care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Nathan","Initials":"N","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7757-5353","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK.

Methods This exploratory study investigated the views of relatives and care workers of new relationships or sexual intimacy between care home residents with dementia, whilst still married to another person. It reports the themes that emerged in qualitative interviews with eight relatives of people with dementia and with 12 frontline care home staff working in two English care homes. Interviews took place in 2015 using a hypothetical vignette that unfolded in four stages. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. Findings The views of care home staff and relatives had similarities in general terms regarding the problems arising around expressions of sexuality in care homes: indicting that a light-hearted or non-physical connection between residents is deemed acceptable, but the moment it becomes a sexual relationship then decision making becomes more complicated. Staff were inclined to turn to managers for advice and to consider separating residents. They expressed familiarity with distracting residents from situations that were of concern. Relatives were considerate of the difficulties and dilemmas faced by care home staff. Conclusion The use of a vignette facilitated discussion of a potentially sensitive topic.

However, limited understanding exists regarding the personal and relational meanings attributed to the diagnostic experience. Drawn from the findings of a larger multi-site study conducted in four areas of England, this article presents a subset of the data where five participants and their carers and two people living alone initially presented themselves at a memory clinic for diagnostic testing, with this presentation eventually resulting in a confirmed, and shared, diagnosis of dementia. All 12 participants were interviewed at two time points in the study: at the time of first presentation to the memory clinic and shortly after the diagnosis had been shared with them. Informed by the grounded theory method, constant comparative analysis was applied to the data and this process resulted in a four-phase sequential model of diagnostic transition: (1) becoming self-aware\u2192seeking outside help; (2) being referred\u2192receiving a clinic appointment; (3) undergoing tests\u2192being told what's wrong; and (4) adjusting to the diagnosis\u2192negotiating everyday expectations. Running through each phase was the core category of 'living with uncertainty' which summarised the entire diagnostic journey for all study participants.

Care staff, often with limited dementia training, may have to support residents with distressed behaviour on a daily basis. Evidence about the support of residents with distressed or challenging behaviour in the South African context is lacking. This exploratory study aimed to gain an understanding of what care home staff perceived to be distressed behaviour, their coping strategies and how they learned to work with residents with behavioural symptoms of dementia. Methods An exploratory study was conducted among 17 participants working in four care homes in the Western Cape province of South Africa in 2014. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded. Data were analysed thematically. Findings Findings reflected the literature with regard to examples of behavioural symptoms of people with dementia that staff find challenging to manage. Overall, the majority of staff reported holding positive feelings about working with people with dementia. All preferred interpersonal approaches to manage distressed behaviour above medication although a small minority noted the use of medication in some cases. Dementia training was considered by most participants as an unmet need. Conclusion This exploratory study identified care home workers' desires for training about dementia and their preferences for interpersonal as opposed to pharmacological approaches to managing residents' distressed behaviour. The legacy of race and cultural perspectives in South Africa appears to still influence care practice and provision. Staff commitment, their interest in advancing their practice and their aspirations to offer more person-centred care were evident. Dementia training was identified as potentially helpful to care home staff who manage residents' distressed behaviour. Training should be developed in South Africa to promote good practice."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Wyk","ForeName":"Adele","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"King's College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"King's College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clark","ForeName":"Charlotte","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"01","Day":"12"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Behavioral Symptoms"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Staff","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"South Africa"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["South Africa","care home","challenging behaviour","dementia","social care"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26764263","1471301215622092","10.1177\/1471301215622092"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26582758","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1468-2834","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"45","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"Observational cohort study: deprivation and access to anti-dementia drugs in the UK.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"148-54"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/ageing\/afv154","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["UK National Dementia Strategies prioritise fair access to dementia treatments for the whole population.

This was driven by data from English practices where prescribing rates were consistently lower in more deprived patients compared with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where prescribing was not related to deprivation quintile. Compared with English practices, anti-dementia medication was prescribed more often in Northern Irish (1.81, 1.41-2.34) and less in Welsh practices (0.68, 0.55-0.82), with a trend towards more prescribing in Scottish practices (1.14, 0.98-1.32).

With an uncertain illness trajectory and unpredictable levels of deterioration and stability in symptoms, people with a diagnosis of dementia may live with uncertainty and anxiety and find it hard to make plans or decisions for their future. People with memory problems and caregivers seeking a diagnosis of dementia may also potentially find themselves navigating a labyrinth-like maze of services, practitioners, assessments, and memory tests, with limited understanding of test scores and little information about what support is available. In this context of uncertainty, the apparent clarity and certainty of a \"dementia care pathway\" may be attractive. However, the term \"dementia care pathway\" has multiple and overlapping meanings, which can potentially give rise to further confusion if these are ill-defined or a false consensus is presumed. This review distinguishes four meanings: 1) a mechanism for the management and containment of uncertainty and confusion, useful for the professional as well as the person with dementia; 2) a manual for sequencing care activities; 3) a guide to consumers, indicating eligibility for care activities, or a guide to self-management for dementia dyads, indicating the appropriateness of care activities; and 4) a manual for \"walking with\" the person. Examples of these approaches are presented from UK dementia services with illustrations of existing care pathways and associated time points, specifically focusing on: 1) early symptom identification and first service encounters, 2) assessment process, 3) diagnostic disclosure, 4) postdiagnostic support, and 5) appropriate interventions. We review the evidence around these themes, as well as discuss service pathways and referral routes used by some services in England and internationally. We conclude that the attraction of the term \"care pathway\" is seductive, but caution is needed in taking shared understandings for granted.

way of improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of support for people with dementia. In this study we adapted and implemented a successful United States' model of case management in primary care in England. The results are reported elsewhere, but a key finding was that little case management took place. This paper reports the findings of the process evaluation which used Normalization Process Theory to understand the barriers to implementation.","Ethnographic methods were used to explore the views and experiences of case management. Interviews with 49 stakeholders (patients, carers, case managers, health and social care professionals) were supplemented with observation of case managers during meetings and initial assessments with patients. Transcripts and field notes were analysed initially using the constant comparative approach and emerging themes were then mapped onto the framework of Normalization Process Theory.","The primary focus during implementation was on the case managers as isolated individuals, with little attention being paid to the social or organizational context within which they worked. Barriers relating to each of the four main constructs of Normalization Process Theory were identified, with a lack of clarity over the scope and boundaries of the intervention (coherence); variable investment in the intervention (cognitive participation); a lack of resources, skills and training to deliver case management (collective action); and limited reflection and feedback on the case manager role (reflexive monitoring).","Despite the intuitive appeal of case management to all stakeholders, there were multiple barriers to implementation in primary care in England including: difficulties in embedding case managers within existing well-established community networks; the challenges of protecting time for case management; and case managers' inability to identify, and act on, emerging patient and carer needs (an essential, but previously unrecognised, training need). In the light of these barriers it is unclear whether primary care is the most appropriate setting for case management in England. The process evaluation highlights key aspects of implementation and training to be addressed in future studies of case management for dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bamford","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

The increased incidence, prevalence and recognition of dementia suggest that this area of practice will expand and so learning from previous practice may offer helpful insights. This paper describes and reflects upon social work practice with 'dements' in the 1950s in England. It draws on a reading of a small book written by a psychiatric social worker, Miss M (Muriel) H Bree, outlining her role in providing after-care to patients with neuro-syphilis who had been discharged from hospital to live with their families between 1942 and 1952 through her consideration of 275 case records and seven illustrative case studies. As a historical document, Bree's account presents a rich description of the patients and their social circumstances in post-war Britain; an account of practice from a hospital based setting that reached into the community, and of the engagement of a social worker with her clients and their family members. Threads and continuities with contemporary social work practice with people with dementia are explored; particularly work with family carers, younger people with dementia, and the value placed upon continuity of care.

Case management offers a way of co-ordinating services along the care pathway and therefore could provide individualised support; however, evidence of the effectiveness of case management for dementia is inconclusive.","To adapt the intervention used in a promising case management project in the USA and test its feasibility and acceptability in English general practice.","In work package 1, a design group of varied professionals, with a carer and staff from the voluntary sector, met six times over a year to identify the skills and personal characteristics required for case management; protocols from the US study were adapted for use in the UK. The feasibility of recruiting general practices and patient-carer dyads and of delivering case management were tested in a pilot study (work package 2). An embedded qualitative study explored stakeholder views on study procedures and case management.","Four general practices, two in the north-east of England (Newcastle) one in London and one in Norfolk, took part in a feasibility pilot study of case management.","Community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers who were not already being case managed by other services.","A social worker shared by the two practices in the north-east and practice nurses in the other two practices were trained to deliver case management. We aimed to recruit 11 people with dementia from each practice who were not already being case managed.","Numbers of people with dementia and their carers recruited, numbers and content of contacts, needs identified and perceptions of case management among stakeholders.","Recruitment of practices and patients was slow and none of the practices achieved its recruitment target. It took more than 6 months to recruit a total of 28 people with dementia. Practice Quality and Outcome Framework registers for dementia contained only 60% of the expected number of people, most living in care homes. All stakeholders were positive about the potential of case management; however, only one of the four practices achieved a level of case management activity that might have influenced patient and carer outcomes. Case managers' activity levels were not related solely to time available for case management. Delivery of case management was hindered by limited clarity about the role, poor integration with existing services and a lack of embeddedness within primary care. There were discrepancies between case manager and researcher judgements about need, and evidence of a high threshold for acting on unmet need. The practice nurses experienced difficulties in ring-fencing case management time.","The model of case management developed and evaluated in this feasibility study is unlikely to be sustainable in general practice under current conditions and in our view it would not be appropriate to attempt a definitive trial of this model. This study could inform the development of a case management role with a greater likelihood of impact. Different approaches to recruiting and training case managers, and identifying people with dementia who might benefit from case management, are needed, as is exploration of the scale of need for this type of working.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN74015152.","This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 18, No. 52.

making of decisions in respect of people who have never had or have lost decision-making capacity. As part of a 5-year research program investigating the implementation and adoption of the Mental Capacity Act in dementia practice, we interviewed staff working in different care homes at two time points (32 staff at Time 1 in 2008 and 27 staff at Time 2 in 2012) in South East England. At baseline Time 1, daily practice seemed to resonate with Mental Capacity Act principles of respecting decisions and trying to act in a person's best interests. This paper reports Time 2 findings. We found that few care home staff interviewed specifically reported finding the Mental Capacity Act helpful in crystallizing the legal basis of their work. Most continued to offer illustrations of day-to-day practice in which they paid attention to individual choices, took account of the wishes of residents' families, and tried to act in residents' best interests but referred major decisions to their seniors. This study highlights the potential of referring to specific day-to-day practice in care homes when offering training or scrutinizing practice in dementia care more generally so that the work is set in its legal as well as moral framework. Care home staff in this study reported that advanced planning and pre-specifying preferences were more common among new care home residents, especially those with dementia, indicating that greater understanding of these is required by staff.

Some referenced Lawton's model (Dementia Quality of Life [DQOL] and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease [QOL-AD]), though these tapped part of this only; others claimed relationship to a health-related QoL concept (e.g. DEMQOL), though had less social relevance; others were based on limited domains (e.g. activity, affect) or clinical opinions (Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia [QUALID]). Many measures were based on proxy assessments or observations of people with dementia's QoL, rather than their own ratings. The Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia (BASQID) was developed involving people with dementia and caregivers, but excluded some of their main themes. All measures were tested on selective samples only (ranging from community to hospital clinics, or subsamples\/waves of existing population surveys), in a few sites.

Despite the recent increase in care home research, residents with dementia are often excluded from studies. Care home research networks have been recommended by the Ministerial Advisory Group on Dementia Research (MAGDR) as a way of increasing research opportunities for residents with dementia. This paper reports on an evaluation of the feasibility and early impact of an initiative to increase care home participation in research.","A two phase, mixed methods approach was used; phase 1 established a baseline of current and recent studies including the National Institute for Health Research portfolio. To explore the experiences of recruiting care homes and research participation, interviews were conducted with researchers working for the Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN) and care home managers. In phase 2, four DeNDRoN area offices recruited care homes to a care home network for their region. The care home networks were separate from the DeNDRoN research network. Diaries were used to document and cost recruitment; DeNDRoN staff were interviewed to understand the barriers, facilitators and impact of the care home networks.","Thirty three current or recent studies were identified as involving care homes as care home specific studies or those which included residents. Further details of care home recruitment were obtained on 20 studies by contacting study teams. Care home managers were keen to be involved in research that provided staff support, benefits for residents and with minimal disruption. In phase 2, 141 care homes were recruited to the care home research networks, through corporate engagement and individual invitation. Pre-existing relationships with care homes facilitated recruitment. Sites with minimal experience of working with care homes identified the need for care home training for researchers.","Phase 1 review revealed a small but increasing number of studies involving care homes. Phase 2 demonstrated the feasibility of care home research networks, their potential to increase recruitment to research and develop partnerships between health services and care homes, but highlighted the need for care home training for researchers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Sue L","Initials":"SL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, UK. c.goodman@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smith","ForeName":"Adam","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carrick","ForeName":"Natasha","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"08\/1809\/231","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"04","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Med Res Methodol","NlmUniqueID":"100968545","ISSNLinking":"1471-2288"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Assisted Living Facilities"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurodegenerative Diseases"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Selection"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"18"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2014","Month":"03","Day":"31"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"4","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"4","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24708761","1471-2288-14-47","10.1186\/1471-2288-14-47","PMC4021218"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Clin Geriatr Med. 1995 Aug;11(3):503-16","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7585393"}},{"Citation":"Health Care Financ Rev. 1995 Summer;16(4):55-83","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10151895"}},{"Citation":"J R Soc Med. 2007 Jun;100(6):258-61","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17541093"}},{"Citation":"JAMA. 1986 May 16;255(19):2622-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"3701976"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2012;12:31","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"22731652"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimers Res Ther. 2012 Jul 06;4(4):23","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"22769969"}},{"Citation":"Lancet. 2002 Jul 20;360(9328):225-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12133659"}},{"Citation":"J Am Med Dir Assoc. 2011 Sep;12(7):487-492.e1","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21450252"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2011 May;15(4):475-81","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21500014"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2009;9:38","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19703277"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2008 Feb;48(1):8-15","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18381827"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24381044","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"09","Day":"08"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2014","Month":"01","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"13","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia nurses' experience of the Mental Capacity Act 2005: a follow-up study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"131-43"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301212454354","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Specialist community dementia nurses are an appropriate sample to investigate longer-term decision-making and end-of-life care planning. Implemented in 2007, the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) provides opportunities for assisting with planning and making decisions on others' behalf, and may be expected to be entrenched within clinical practice. We conducted follow-up qualitative interviews with 15 community-based dementia nurses to detect changes and developments in views and practices of the MCA. Thematic analysis identified recurrent themes and developed into a coding framework. At Time2, there was greater awareness of general and specific principles of MCA and greater confidence in using it. There was greater involvement in discussing planning finances, less so in end-of-life-care. Some participants were concerned about lack of understanding amongst other professionals and felt more public awareness was required. Supplementary training, opportunities for mentoring and supervision may develop greater confidence among dementia practitioners and support their roles in informing and advising people with dementia and carers.

This study explored perceived barriers to the delivery of high-quality palliative care for people with dementia using semi-structured interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis with an inductive approach and a coding strategy. To improve the trustworthiness of the analysis, independent reading and coding of the transcripts were undertaken, followed by discussions among the four researchers to reach agreement and consensus of the themes. Two group interviews (n\u00a0=\u00a07 and n\u00a0=\u00a06), 16 individual interviews and five interviews of pairs of professionals were conducted in 2011\/2012 with participants from backgrounds in palliative care, dementia services, palliative care research and policy making. Four themes were identified as barriers to providing high-quality palliative care for people with dementia: (i) ambivalence towards the systematisation of palliative care; (ii) disconnection between services; (iii) different assumptions about training needs; and (iv) negotiation of risk. Understanding these barriers to providing high-quality palliative care for people with dementia could help in the development of a dementia-specific palliative care pathway.

end-of-life care for people with dementia is often sub-optimal. Palliative care for people with dementia poses particular challenges to those providing services, and current policy initiatives recommend education and training in palliative care for those working with patients with dementia. However, there are few evaluations of the effectiveness of dementia education and training. This paper presents a narrative review undertaken in 2011-2012 of evaluations of palliative care education for those working with people with dementia at the end of life. A total of eight papers were identified that described and evaluated such palliative care education; none reported benefits for people with dementia. There is a clear need to develop and evaluate educational interventions designed to improve palliative and end-of-life care for people with dementia. Some suggestions for educationally sound approaches are discussed.

Dementia attracts multi-disciplinary and multi-professional questions and responses. Three broad theoretical models underpin dementia care policy (as well as practice and research): biomedical, psycho-social and social-gerontological. These are critically assessed and discussed in relation to illustrative examples of dementia policy across three policy regions of the devolved UK. The contribution and implications of theoretical models of dementia policy highlight the importance of recognising how different theoretical understandings of dementia influence dementia policy. The development and improvement of policy and practice in the area of dementia care require an understanding of the often implicit theoretical approaches to dementia.

The review will include published literature involving a wide range of electronic databases using sensitive and comprehensive searches and lateral searching including checking citations.We will produce a descriptive map of the studies by design and by the focus of interventions and apply further inclusion criteria, developed in conjunction with lay experts, to select studies for an in-depth systematic review that will include independent quality assessment and detailed data extraction by two reviewers.The review process will be integrated with stakeholder meetings and a multidisciplinary expert advisory group to guide the review parameters and shape the research questions on the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms in people with dementia. Because studies are likely to be diverse in methodology and interventions, we will conduct a narrative synthesis of the in-depth systematic review. If appropriate, we will pool studies in a meta-analysis. We will explore review findings at both stages through focus groups and interviews with service providers, practitioners, people with dementia and carers.","This integrated review in collaboration with key stakeholders will synthesise research evidence to identify appropriate interventions for effective management of behavioural and psychological symptoms that supports people with dementia living at home and their carers, and which reflects their priorities. It will make recommendations for research and practice.","PROSPERO registration number:

currently services are fragmented and the quality of care is variable. Case management is a popular approach to care co-ordination, but evidence to date on its effectiveness in dementia has been equivocal. Case management interventions need to be designed to overcome obstacles to care co-ordination and maximise benefit. A successful case management methodology was adapted from the United States (US) version for use in English primary care, with a view to a definitive trial. Medical Research Council guidance on the development of complex interventions was implemented in the adaptation process, to capture the skill sets, person characteristics and learning needs of primary care based case managers.","Co-design of the case manager role in a single NHS provider organisation, with external peer review by professionals and carers, in an iterative technology development process.","The generic skills and personal attributes were described for practice nurses taking up the case manager role in their workplaces, and for social workers seconded to general practice teams, together with a method of assessing their learning needs. A manual of information material for people with dementia and their family carers was also created using the US intervention as its source.","Co-design produces rich products that have face validity and map onto the complexities of dementia and of health and care services.

It presents an interactionist account of mistreatment of older people in such establishments. Starting with an outline of definitional issues surrounding the topic, the allied concept of dignity is also briefly explored, and one important model described; we present dignity as the converse of mistreatment. The article argues for the potential of a positioning theory analysis of mistreatment. Positioning theory proposes that interactions are based on taking of 'positions', clusters of rights and duties to act in certain ways and impose particular meanings, which enable or prohibit access to certain storylines. It is argued that 'malignant' positioning can contribute to the creation of a climate that allows mistreatment to take place, or fails to prohibit its development. Mistreatment of people with dementia is used as an illustration, and it is argued that this is potentially generated by negative feedback loops of behaviour patterns, interpretations and malignant positioning by staff or family carers and subsequent response to these interpretations by the person with dementia. Positioning theory also allows for an explanation of the importance and impact of organizational cultures and social factors such as ageism. Individual staff members take positions, use meanings and develop storylines imbued with such factors. This understanding therefore overcomes some of the potential confusions created by concepts such as organizational or institutional abuse, removing the need to ascribe intentions and personal responsibility to such constructs. The article concludes with some suggestions for further research to develop an understanding of the kinds of cultures that allow mistreatment and consequently to inform the development of protective measures.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 London School of Economics and Political Science 2013."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stevens","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London. martin.stevens@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Biggs","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dixon","ForeName":"Josie","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tinker","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Br J Sociol","NlmUniqueID":"0373126","ISSNLinking":"0007-1315"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Elder Abuse","QualifierName":"prevention & control"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Theoretical"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Personhood"},{"DescriptorName":"Vulnerable Populations"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23713559","10.1111\/1468-4446.12017"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23625551","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"06","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"29","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Negotiating a labyrinth: experiences of assessment and diagnostic journey in cognitive impairment and dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"58-67"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.3969","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["There has been a global push towards the earlier diagnosis of dementia, but there is little understanding of the transitions along the assessment and diagnostic pathway from the perspective of people affected by memory problems, cognitive impairment and early dementia.

The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (England and Wales) provides a legal framework to safeguard the rights of people with dementia to make their own decisions for as long as possible. The impact of this on long-term planning has been investigated; everyday decision-making in people's own homes remains unexplored.","Using a phenomenological approach, we interviewed 12 dyads (one person with dementia + one carer) four times over one year to ascertain experience of decision-making, how decisions were negotiated, and how dynamics changed. Qualitative interviews were conducted in people's own homes, and thematic analysis was applied to transcripts.","Respecting autonomy, decision-specificity and best interests underlay most everyday decisions in this sample. Over time, dyads transitioned from supported decision-making, where person with dementia and carer made decisions together, to substituted decision-making, where carers took over much decision-making. Points along this continuum represented carers' active involvement in retaining their relative's engagement through providing cues, reducing options, using retrospective information, and using the best interests principle. Long-term spouse carers seemed most equipped to make substitute decisions for their spouses; adult children and friend carers struggled with this.","Carers may gradually take on decision-making for people with dementia. This can bring with it added stresses, such as determining their relative's decision-making capacity and weighing up what is in their best interests. Practitioners and support services should provide timely advice to carers and people with dementia around everyday decision-making, and be mindful how abilities may change."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Samsi","ForeName":"Kritika","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College London, Strand, London WC2R 2LS, UK. kritika.1.samsi@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"G0900011","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2013","Month":"03","Day":"19"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Personal Autonomy"},{"DescriptorName":"Proxy"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Retrospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Wales"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"3","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"3","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23510662","S1041610213000306","10.1017\/S1041610213000306"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23336476","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"01","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1478-5242","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"63","Issue":"606","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners","ISOAbbreviation":"Br J Gen Pract"},"ArticleTitle":"From forgetfulness to dementia: clinical and commissioning implications of diagnostic experiences.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e69-75"},"ELocationID":"10.3399\/bjgp13X660805","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The National Dementia Strategy in England stressed the importance of earlier diagnosis of dementia.

people with dementia in the community.","The systematic review carried out for the NICE\/SCIE Guidelines was updated from January 2006, Cochrane Reviews were identified, and other publications found by consultation with experts.","The insidious and very variable development of dementia syndromes makes recognition of the syndrome problematic in primary care. Dementia is probably under-diagnosed and under treated with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary care physicians. This problem of under-diagnosis is probably not due to lack of diagnostic skills, but rather to the interaction of case-complexity, pressure on time and the negative effects of reimbursement systems. Primary care physicians often over-estimate the prevalence of dementia syndromes, but in some countries may also overestimate the prevalence of vascular dementia compared with Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosis is a step-wise process which can be aided by use of a cognitive function test, of which there are a number suitable for primary care use. Evidence based practice protocols can enhance detection rates in primary care, and there is growing evidence that communication skills in talking to people with dementia about dementia can be improved. Nevertheless there are multiple obstacles to bringing recognition forward in time, both in public awareness and professional understanding of the early changes in dementia.","There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify population screening in primary care but earlier recognition of people with dementia syndrome is possible within primary care. The diagnosis of dementia is a shared responsibility between generalist and specialist disciplines. Primary care physicians should explore patients' ideas and concerns around their symptoms prior to referral and tentatively discuss possible diagnoses. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the primary care physician should provide both practical and emotional support to allow the patient and their family to come to terms with living with dementia, and refer them for additional psychosocial support if required."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care for Older People, University College London, London, NW3 2PF, UK. s.iliffe@pcps.ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ashley","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"DeNDRoN Primary Care Clinical Studies Group"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MC_U122797163","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Physician-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"66"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19226529","10.1002\/gps.2204"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19058377","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"02","Day":"02"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1474-5186","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Mental health today (Brighton, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Ment Health Today"},"ArticleTitle":"Purchasing power: getting the best for older people.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"26-9"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"At first glance, commissioning mental health may look like a heart-sink project, but it need not be.

The impact of early recognition of dementia is under-researched in primary care nursing.","To explore whether community mental health nurses (CMHNs), community nurses (CNs) and practice nurses (PNs) have different perspectives on early diagnosis of dementia and to consider the possible effects of any variation.","Data are drawn from questionnaires completed by CMHNs (79), CNs (153) and PNs (36) who attended workshops offered on 24 occasions in 21 settings across the United Kingdom. The workshops attracted a range of primary care practitioners and were part of a training programme on early diagnosis of dementia.","Analysis of the data shows some differences in knowledge, experience and confidence between the three nurse groups. CMHNs were more confident in their abilities to recognize dementia and found providing support less difficult than CNs and PNs. CMHNs considered that they were best placed to co-ordinate services for people with newly recognized dementia. CNs and PNs, however, reported experience of working with people with dementia and many appeared able to respond to early signs and to identify potential sources of support.","While CMHNs may have a key role in responding effectively to the newly identified needs of people with early dementia, other nurses working in the community are likely to encounter people with early dementia. In the context of a policy objective to identify people with dementia earlier, all community-based nurses should be able to recognize the possibility of dementia and support those undergoing referral or assessment. Their confidence in doing so should be enhanced by continued professional development. Training in dementia recognition, involvement in and membership of primary care teams supporting people with dementia should not be confined to CMHNs. Nurses who regularly encounter the general population of older people may be well placed to provide continuity of support for those who may, or may not, have cause to suspect that they or their relatives have early dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workfore Research Unit, King's College London, London, UK. jill.manthorpe@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eden","ForeName":"Alison","Initials":"A"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Adv Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"7609811","ISSNLinking":"0309-2402"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Health Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse Practitioners"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse's Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"3","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"5","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"3","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["14521684","2782","10.1046\/j.1365-2648.2003.02782.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12876106","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"12","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0263-2136","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2003","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"Family practice","ISOAbbreviation":"Fam Pract"},"ArticleTitle":"Sooner or later?

The term diagnosis could usefully be replaced by recognition, to aid this shift in model.

Many of these studies focus on individual difficulties and neglect the social, environmental and cultural aspects of meals and eating.
