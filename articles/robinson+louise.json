To assist in the early identification of individuals at high risk of future dementia, numerous prediction models have been developed for use in the general population. However, it is not known whether such models also provide accurate predictions among stroke patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether existing dementia risk prediction models that were developed for use in the general population can also be applied to individuals with a history of stroke to predict poststroke dementia with equivalent predictive validity.","Data were harmonized from 4 stroke studies (follow-up range, \u224812-18 months poststroke) from Hong Kong, the United States, the Netherlands, and France. Regression analysis was used to test 3 risk prediction models: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia score, the Australian National University Alzheimer Disease Risk Index, and the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator. Model performance or discrimination accuracy was assessed using the C statistic or area under the curve. Calibration was tested using the Gr\u00f8nnesby and Borgan and the goodness-of-fit tests.","The predictive accuracy of the models varied but was generally low compared with the original development cohorts, with the Australian National University Alzheimer Disease Risk Index (C-statistic, 0.66) and the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (C-statistic, 0.61) both performing better than the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia score (area under the curve, 0.53).","Dementia risk prediction models developed for the general population do not perform well in individuals with stroke. Their poor performance could have been due to the need for additional or different predictors related to stroke and vascular risk factors or methodological differences across studies (eg, length of follow-up, age distribution). Future work is needed to develop simple and cost-effective risk prediction models specific to poststroke dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tang","ForeName":"Eugene Y

However, most people with dementia live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where dementia risk prediction research is almost non-existent and the ability of current models to predict dementia is unknown. This study investigated whether dementia prediction models developed in HICs are applicable to LMICs.","Data were from the 10\/66 Study. Individuals aged 65 years or older and without dementia at baseline were selected from China, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. Dementia incidence was assessed over 3-5 years, with diagnosis according to the 10\/66 Study diagnostic algorithm. Discrimination and calibration were tested for five models: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia risk score (CAIDE); the Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia (AgeCoDe) model; the Australian National University Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI); the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI); and the Rotterdam Study Basic Dementia Risk Model (BDRM). Models were tested with use of Cox regression. The discriminative accuracy of each model was assessed using Harrell's concordance (c)-statistic, with a value of 0\u00b770 or higher considered to indicate acceptable discriminative ability. Calibration (model fit) was assessed statistically using the Gr\u00f8nnesby and Borgan test.","11\u2008143 individuals without baseline dementia and with available follow-up data were included in the analysis. During follow-up (mean 3\u00b78 years [SD 1\u00b73]), 1069 people progressed to dementia across all sites (incidence rate 24\u00b79 cases per 1000 person-years). Performance of the models varied. Across countries, the discriminative ability of the CAIDE (0\u00b752\u2264c\u22640\u00b763) and AgeCoDe (0\u00b757\u2264c\u22640\u00b774) models was poor. By contrast, the ANU-ADRI (0\u00b766\u2264c\u22640\u00b778), BDSI (0\u00b762\u2264c\u22640\u00b778), and BDRM (0\u00b766\u2264c\u22640\u00b778) models showed similar levels of discriminative ability to those of the development cohorts. All models showed good calibration, especially at low and intermediate levels of predicted risk. The models validated best in Peru and poorest in the Dominican Republic and China.","Not all dementia prediction models developed in HICs can be simply extrapolated to LMICs. Further work defining what number and which combination of risk variables works best for predicting risk of dementia in LMICs is needed. However, models that transport well could be used immediately for dementia prevention research and targeted risk reduction in LMICs.","National Institute for Health Research, Wellcome Trust, WHO, US Alzheimer's Association, and European Research Council."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

Few medicines management interventions have been developed which are aimed at community-dwelling PwD. This study sought to develop an intervention to improve medicines management for PwD in primary care using a theory-informed approach.","Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs (n\u00a0=\u200915) and community pharmacists (n\u00a0=\u200915) to explore participants' views and experiences of medicines management for PwD, and their perceptions of barriers and facilitators to successful medicines management for PwD. The 14-domain Theoretical Domains Framework was the underpinning theoretical guide, allowing key theoretical domains to be identified and mapped to behaviour change techniques (BCTs) which are considered the 'active ingredients' of an intervention. Draft interventions were developed to operationalise selected BCTs and were presented to GPs and community pharmacists during task groups. Final selection of an intervention for feasibility testing was guided by feedback provided during these task groups and through application of the APEASE (Affordability, Practicability, Effectiveness\/cost-effectiveness, Acceptability, Side-effects\/safety, Equity) criteria.","Participants expressed a number of concerns about medicines management for PwD, particularly monitoring adherence to medication regimens and conducting medication review. Two draft interventions comprising selected BCTs ('Modelling or demonstration of behaviour'; 'Salience of consequences'; 'Health consequences'; 'Social and environmental consequences'; 'Action planning'; Social support or encouragement', 'Self-monitoring of behaviour') were developed, each targeting GPs and community pharmacists. Following the task groups and discussions within the research team, the community pharmacy-based intervention was selected for future feasibility testing. The intervention will target community pharmacists to conduct a medication review (incorporating an adherence check) with a PwD, delivered as an online video demonstrating key behaviours. The video will include feedback emphasising positive outcomes of performing the behaviours. Action planning and a quick reference guide will be used as complementary intervention components.","A community pharmacist-based intervention has been developed targeting medicines management for PwD in primary care using a systematic, theory-informed approach. Future work will determine the usability and acceptability of implementing this intervention in clinical practice."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Barry","ForeName":"Heather E","Initials":"HE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School

people with dementia nearing, and at, the end of life (EoL) by facilitating some key features of care. The aim of this study was to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) values from the general public perspective, for the different levels of support that the DNS can provide.","Contingent valuation methods were used to elicit the maximum WTP for scenarios describing different types of support provided by the DNS for EoL care in dementia. In a general population online survey, 1002 participants aged 18\u2009years or more sampled from the United Kingdom provided valuations. Five scenarios were valued with mean WTP value calculated for each scenario along with the relationship between mean WTP and participant characteristics.","The mean WTP varied across scenarios with higher values for the scenarios offering more features. Participants with some experience of dementia were willing to pay more compared with those with no experience. WTP values were higher for high-income groups compared with the lowest income level (P\u2009<\u2009.05). There was no evidence to suggest that respondent characteristics such as age, gender, family size, health utility or education status influenced the WTP values.","The general population values the anticipated improvement in dementia care provided by a DNS.

These answers are needed to improve the quality of care and equity of access to care, and therefore the quality of life, of people with dementia and their carers.","DETERMIND is a programme of research consisting of seven complementary workstreams (WS) exploring various components that may result in unequal dementia care: WS1: Recruitment and follow-up of the DETERMIND cohort-900 people with dementia and their carers from three geographically and socially diverse sites within six months following diagnosis, and follow them up for three years. WS2: Investigation of the extent of inequalities in access to dementia care. WS3: Relationship between use and costs of services and outcomes. WS4: Experiences of self-funders of care. WS5: Decision-making processes for people with dementia and carers. WS6: Effect of diagnostic stage and services on outcomes. WS7: Theory of Change informed strategy and actions for applying the research findings.","During the life of the programme, analysing baseline results and then follow-up of the DETERMIND cohort over 3\u2009years, we will establish evidence on current services and practice. DETERMIND will deliver novel, detailed data on inequalities in dementia care and what drives positive and negative outcomes and costs for people with dementia and carers, and identify factors that

There is presently little evidence to guide the management of such injuries, and yet there are potentially substantial benefits to be gained if the outcomes of these injuries could be improved. This study aimed to design an appropriate new health-care intervention for people with dementia following a fall and to assess the feasibility of its delivery in the UK NHS.","To determine whether or not it is possible to design an intervention to improve outcomes of falls in dementia, to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the DIFRID (Developing an Intervention for Fall related Injuries in Dementia) intervention and to investigate the feasibility of a future randomised controlled trial and the data collection tools needed to evaluate both the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of the DIFRID intervention.","This was a mixed-methods feasibility study. A systematic review (using Cochrane methodology) and realist review [using Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) methodology] explored the existing evidence base and developed programme theories. Searches were carried out in November 2015 (updated in January 2018) for effectiveness studies and in August 2016 for economic studies. A prospective observational study identified service use via participant diary completion. Qualitative methods (semistructured interviews, focus groups and observation) were used to explore current practice, stakeholder perspectives of the health and social care needs of people with dementia following a fall, ideas for intervention and barriers to and facilitators of change. Each of the resulting data sets informed intervention development via Delphi consensus methods. Finally, a single-arm feasibility study with embedded process evaluation was conducted.","This study was set in the community.","The participants were (1) people with dementia presenting with falls necessitating health-care attention in each setting (primary care, the community and secondary care) at three sites and their carers, (2) professionals delivering the intervention, who were responsible for training and supervision and who were members of the intervention team, (3) professionals responsible for approaching and recruiting participants and (4) carers of participants with dementia.","This was a complex multidisciplinary therapy intervention. Physiotherapists, occupational therapists and support workers delivered up to 22 sessions of tailored activities in the home or local area of the person with dementia over a period of 12 weeks.","(1) Assessment of feasibility of study procedures; (2) assessment of the acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of intervention components; and (3) assessment of the suitability and acceptability of outcome measures for people with dementia and their carers (number of falls, quality of life, fear of falling, activities of daily living, goal-setting, health-care utilisation and carer burden).","A multidisciplinary intervention delivered in the homes of people with dementia was designed based on qualitative work, realist review and recommendations of the consensus panel. The intervention was delivered to 11 people with dementia. The study suggested that the intervention is both feasible and acceptable to stakeholders. A number of modifications were recommended to address some of the issues arising during feasibility testing. The measurement of outcome measures was successful.","The study has highlighted the feasibility of delivering a creative, tailored, individual approach to intervention for people with dementia following a fall. Although the intervention required greater investment of time than usual practice, many staff valued the opportunity to work more closely with people with dementia and their carers. We conclude that further research is now needed to refine this intervention in the context of a pilot randomised controlled trial.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN41760734 and PROSPERO CRD42016029565.","This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 23, No. 59.

do not have dementia. When they fall over, they are more likely to hurt themselves. They do not get better as easily as people without dementia. After hurting themselves, people with dementia may need a lot more help in looking after themselves. They, and their carer, may not have such a good quality of life after the fall. In this study, we developed and tested a package of care to help people with dementia recover from a fall. In the first part of the study, we looked for papers about clinical trials that have tried to make things better for people with dementia who have had a fall. We found that there were very few previous clinical trials, but we found ideas for ways in which this could be improved. In the second part of the study, we found out what happens to people with dementia who ask for help after an injury due to a fall. We found that very few services were used by people with dementia who fall. We interviewed them and their carers to find out what help they thought they needed after the fall and what they thought we could do better. We also spoke to the staff in existing services to find out how they thought services for people with dementia could be improved. In the third part of the study, we asked a group of experts, people with dementia and their carers to look at the findings of the first two parts of the study. They helped us to design a care package for people with dementia after a fall. In the fourth part of the study, we practised giving the new care package to 11 people with dementia in their own homes. This was very successful and we now recommend that the package is tested further in randomised controlled clinical trials."},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ACCIDENTAL FALLS","DEMENTIA","HEALTH SERVICES NEEDS AND DEMAND","INTERVENTIONS","PILOTS","PROSPECTIVE STUDIES"]},"CoiStatement":"Louise Robinson reports grants from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Professor award and a NIHR Senior Investigator award outside the submitted work.

We tested this hypothesis using data from a UK cohort study.","We used data from the baseline (Y0), 2-year (Y2) and 10-year (Y10) waves of the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Participants without dementia at Y2 were included (n\u00a0=\u20098216). Use of benzodiazepines (including nonbenzodiazepine Z-drugs), anticholinergics with score 3 (ACB3) and anticholinergics with score 1 or 2 (ACB12) according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale were coded as ever use (use at Y0 or Y2), recurrent use (Y0 and Y2), new use (Y2, but not Y0) or discontinued use (Y0, but not Y2). The outcome was incident dementia by Y10. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated using Poisson regression adjusted for potential confounders. Pre-planned subgroup analyses were conducted by age, sex and Y2 Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score.","Dementia incidence was 9.3% (N\u00a0=\u2009220 cases) between Y2 and Y10. The adjusted IRRs (95%CI) of developing dementia were 1.06 (0.72, 1.60), 1.28 (0.82, 2.00) and 0.89 (0.68, 1.17) for benzodiazepines, ACB3 and ACB12 ever-users compared with non-users. For recurrent users the respective IRRs were 1.30 (0.79, 2.14), 1.68 (1.00, 2.82) and 0.95 (0.71, 1.28). ACB3 ever-use was associated with dementia among those with Y2 MMSE>\u200925 (IRR\u2009=\u20092.28 [1.32-3.92]), but not if Y2 MMSE\u226425 (IRR\u2009=\u20090.94 [0.51-1.73]).","Neither benzodiazepines nor ACB12 medications were associated with dementia. Recurrent use of ACB3 anticholinergics was associated with dementia, particularly in those with good baseline cognitive function. The long-term prescribing of anticholinergics should be avoided in older people."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grossi","ForeName":"Carlota M","Initials":"CM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Richardson","ForeName":"Kathryn","Initials":"K","Identifier":"0000-0002-0741-8413","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, NR4 7TJ, UK.

huge informal costs of family careers and community support networks. Developing services to meet the needs of patients with complex health problems must involve service users. Professor Robinson has addressed what resources are needed to provide a better quality of care, and how these can be successfully delivered to patients and their family. As Newcastle University's Professor of Primary Care and Ageing, and as a working GP in a Newcastle practice, she is keen to ensure that the benefits of the University's excellent research into ageing and the diseases of old age are translated into high quality treatment and care for older people. She leads the Primary Care Group of the Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN), a national network of researchers which aims to explore the whole spectrum of dementia care from diagnosis and early detection, through to advanced dementia and end of life care. Another Professor Robinson's ambitions would be to help create a center of excellence at Newcastle University for training GPs, hospital staff, community nurses and others in all aspects of dementia care. In this lecture, Prof Robinson will talk about how her translational research had influenced UK practice over the last 10+ years and at same time bring in her career development in both clinical and academic field.(Presented at the 1982th Meeting, June 25, 2019)."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute of Ageing, UK."}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Japan","MedlineTA":"Keio J Med","NlmUniqueID":"0376354","ISSNLinking":"0022-9717"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Networks","QualifierName":"supply & distribution"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":["ethics","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Terminal Care","QualifierName":["ethics","organization & administration","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31554775","10.2302\/kjm.68-004-ABST"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"31489532","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"04","Day":"09"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"04","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1573-7284","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"34","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"European journal of epidemiology","ISOAbbreviation":"Eur J Epidemiol"},"ArticleTitle":"Two-decade change in prevalence of cognitive impairment in the UK.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1085-1092"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s10654-019-00554-x","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Identification of individuals at high risk of dementia has usually focused attention on the clinical concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which captures an intermediate state between normal cognitive ageing and dementia. In many countries age specific risk of dementia has declined, but whether this is also the case for subclinical cognitive impairment is unknown. This has important implications for prevention, planning and policy. Here we describe subclinical cognitive impairment and mild dementia prevalence changes, in the UK, over 2\u00a0decades. The Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies have examined the full spectrum of cognition, from normal to dementia, in representative populations of people aged\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years in the UK over the last 2\u00a0decades 7635 participants were interviewed in CFAS I in Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham in 1991, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed. In the same geographical areas, the CFAS II investigators interviewed 7796 individuals in 2011. Using established criteria, the population was categorised into seven groups: no cognitive impairment, Mild cognitive Impairment (defined using consensus criteria), other cognitive impairment no dementia without functional impairment, OCIND with functional impairment, cognitive impairment (MMSE\u2009<\u200924 and no functional impairment), mild dementia (MMSE\u2009<\u200924 with functional impairment, not captured by CFAS dementia criteria), and CFAS dementia criteria. Multinomial logistic regression, adjusted for age and sex, was used to estimate the prevalence of impairment in both studies. Results were standardized to the age-sex specific UK and global population. There is a clear increase in the prevalence of other cognitive Impairment no Dementia (without functional impairment), with the purer MCI remaining stable. In the UK, mild dementia is estimated to fall from 520,704 cases (5.7%, 95% CI 3.8, 8.1) in 1991 to 315,142 (3.0%, 95% CI 2.4, 3.8) in 2011, cognitive impairment, has fallen from 1,225,984 (13.5%, 95% CI 10.1, 17.5) to 654,436 (6.3%, 95% CI 5.4, 7.3) cases. Using additional categories which reflect the continuum of cognitive decline and impairment in populations we see that the mildest dementia declines, but that there is stability in estimates of those who meet MCI criteria. Increases were found in the Other Cognitive Impairment no Dementia group. The decline observed in severe impairment thus seems to have resulted in larger proportions of the population in milder forms, seen alongside physical illnesses."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Richardson","ForeName":"Connor","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute for Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5PL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Blossom C M","Initials":"BCM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, Institute of Mental Health, School of Medicine, University of\u00a0Nottingham, Innovation Park, Nottingham, NG7 2TU, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute for Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5PL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Forvie Site, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0SR, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Matthews","ForeName":"Fiona E","Initials":"FE","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1728-2388","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute for Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5PL, UK.

exposure to benzodiazepines increases dementia risk are conflicting and are compromised by the difficulty of controlling for confounders and by reverse causation. We investigated how estimates for the association between benzodiazepine use and later dementia incidence varied based on study design choices, using a case-control study nested within the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink. A total of 40,770 dementia cases diagnosed between April 2006 and July 2015 were matched on age, sex, available data history, and deprivation to 283,933 control subjects. Benzodiazepines and Z-drug prescriptions were ascertained in a drug-exposure period 4-20 years before dementia diagnosis. Estimates varied with the inclusion of new or prevalent users, with the timing of covariate ascertainment, and with varying time between exposure and outcome. There was no association between any new prescription of benzodiazepines and dementia (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.07), whereas an inverse association was observed among prevalent users (adjusted OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.95), although this was likely induced by unintentional adjustment for colliders. By considering the choice of confounders and timing of exposure and covariate measurement, our findings overall are consistent with no causal effect of benzodiazepines or Z-drugs on dementia incidence.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

Assessment to identify those at high risk of developing a disease using predictive scores has been utilised in different areas of medicine. A number of risk assessment scores for dementia have been developed but none has been recommended for use clinically. The aim of this qualitative study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a risk assessment tool to predict post-stroke dementia.","Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed thematically. The patients and carers were offered interviews at around 6 (baseline) and 12 (follow-up) months post-stroke; clinicians were interviewed once.","The study was conducted in the North-East of England with stroke patients, family carers and healthcare professionals in primary and secondary care.","Thirty-nine interviews were conducted (17 clinicians and 15 stroke patients and their carers at baseline. Twelve stroke patients and their carers were interviewed at follow-up, some interviews were conducted in pairs).","Barriers and facilitators to risk assessment were discussed. For the patients and carers the focus for facilitators were based on the outcomes of risk assessment for example assistance with preparation, diagnosis and for reassurance. For clinicians, facilitators were focused on the process that is, familiarity in primary care, resource availability in secondary care and collaborative care. For barriers, both groups focused on the outcome including for example, the anxiety generated from a potential diagnosis of dementia. For the patients\/carers a further barrier included concerns about how it may affect their recovery. For clinicians there were concerns about limited interventions and how it would be different from standard care.","Risk assessment for dementia post-stroke presents challenges given the ramifications of a potential diagnosis of dementia. Attention needs to be given to how information is communicated and strategies developed to support the patients and carers if risk assessment is used."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

consequences. However, there is limited evidence to inform how best to deliver services to people with dementia following a fall. The aim of the DIFRID study was to determine the feasibility of developing and implementing a new intervention to improve outcomes for people with dementia with fall-related injuries; this encompasses both short-term recovery and reducing the likelihood of future falls. This paper details the development of the DIFRID intervention.","The intervention was designed using an integrated, mixed-methods approach. This involved a realist synthesis of the literature and qualitative data gathered through interviews and focus groups with health and social care professionals (n\u2009=\u200981). An effectiveness review and further interviews and observation were also conducted and are reported elsewhere. A modified Delphi panel approach with 24 experts was then used to establish a consensus on how the findings should translate into a new intervention. After feedback from key stakeholders (n\u2009=\u200915) on the proposed model, the intervention was manualised and training developed.","We identified key components of a new intervention covering three broad areas: \u2022 Ensuring that the circumstances of rehabilitation are optimised for people with dementia \u2022 Compensating for the reduced ability of people with dementia to self-manage \u2022 Equipping the workforce with the necessary skills and information to care for this patient group Consensus was achieved on 54 of 69 statements over two rounds of the Delphi surveys. The statements were used to model the intervention and finalise the accompanying manual and protocol for a feasibility study. Stakeholder feedback was generally positive and the majority of suggested intervention components were approved. The proposed outcome was a 12-week complex multidisciplinary intervention primarily based at the patient's home.","A new intervention has been developed to improve outcomes for people with dementia following a fall requiring healthcare attention. The feasibility of this intervention is currently being tested.","ISRCTN41760734

undertaken. The following electronic databases were searched: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, ASSIA and Scopus, as well as Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), ProQuest, PubMed and SCIE: Social Care Online. Initial searches were run in August 2014 (update search September 2016). Titles and abstracts of studies retrieved were screened independently. The full text of eligible studies were then independently assessed by two review team members. All included studies were assessed using a standard quality appraisal tool.","Eight studies relating to delirium, six on dementia and two on delirium and dementia were included, each testing the use of a different educational intervention. Overall, the quality of the studies was low. In relation to delirium, all studies reported a significant increase in participants' knowledge immediately post-intervention. Two of the dementia studies reported an increase in dementia knowledge and dementia confidence immediately post-intervention.","The variety of outcomes measured makes it difficult to summarise the findings. Although studies found increases in staff knowledge, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that educational interventions for staff lead to improved patient outcomes.Declaration of interestNone."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Abley","ForeName":"Clare","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0002-8391-5657","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Nurse Consultant and Clinical Senior Lecturer,The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,Institute of Health and Society and Newcastle Institute for Ageing,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dickinson","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Associate,Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Andrews","ForeName":"Zoe","Initials":"Z","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Student Intern,Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Prato","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Assistant,Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lindley","ForeName":"Lyndsay","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Assistant,Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Professor of Primary Care and Ageing,Institute of Health and Society; andDirector,Newcastle Institute for Ageing,Newcastle University,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"CAT CL-2013-04-011","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"20"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Br J Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"0342367","ISSNLinking":"0007-1250"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Dysfunction","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Delirium","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitals, General"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality Improvement","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Staff Development"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","delirium","education and training","older people"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"2","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"3","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"2","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30784394","S0007125019000291","10.1192\/bjp.2019.29"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30514221","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"10"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"08"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2318","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"04"}},"Title":"BMC geriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Geriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"What enables good end of life care for people with dementia?

Existing policy, guidance and recommendations are based largely on expert opinion because of a shortage of high quality, empirical research. Previous studies have tended to consider the views and experience of particular groups. Whilst providing important evidence, they do not take into account the diversity of perspectives of different stakeholders. The Supporting Excellence in End of life care in Dementia (SEED) programme involved multiple stakeholder groups and an integrative analysis to identify key components of good EoLC for people with dementia and to inform a new intervention.","The views of national experts, service managers, frontline staff, people with dementia and family carers were explored using a range of qualitative methods (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, discussions and observations of routine care). The large dataset comprises 116 interviews, 12 focus groups and 256\u2009h of observation. Each dataset was initially analysed thematically prior to an integrative analysis, which drew out key themes across stakeholder groups.","Through the integrative analysis seven key factors required for the delivery of good EoLC for people with dementia were identified: timely planning discussions; recognition of end of life and provision of supportive care; co-ordination of care; effective working relationships with primary care; managing hospitalisation; continuing care after death; and valuing staff and ongoing learning. These factors span the entire illness trajectory from planning at a relatively early stage in the illness to continuing care after death.","This unique study has confirmed the relevance of much of the content of existing end of life frameworks to dementia. It has highlighted seven key areas that are particularly important in dementia care. The data are being used to develop an evidence-based intervention to support professionals to deliver better EoLC in dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bamford","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0003-2885-801X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

risk of future dementia. Rehabilitation tends to focus on physical recovery; however, once in the community, it is unclear what happens in the longer term to the stroke-survivor with new memory difficulties.","The aim of this qualitative study was to examine in stroke-survivors what factors influence contact with health professionals.","Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stroke-survivors and their family carers where memory difficulties were reported at 6 months post stroke. A topic guide was used which sought to critically examine participants care experience following their stroke diagnosis. All participants were interviewed at baseline (around 6 months post stroke) and offered an interview at around 12 months post stroke. All interviews were conducted in the North East of England. All transcripts were coded and thematically analysed.","Ten stroke-survivors (age range 72-84 years) were interviewed alongside five carers at baseline; eight stroke-survivors and four carers agreed to a follow-up interview. Three main barriers were identified: (i) fear of a dementia diagnosis; (ii) denial or minimization of symptoms leading to adaptation and (iii) obstacles to seeking help in the community.","With an ageing population and increase in stroke-survival, the burden of post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia will only increase. Stroke-survivors and their family carers in this study have identified issues that may hinder their presentation to health care professionals at a personal and organizational level.

seven decades in different countries and some have reported a decline.","To undertake a systematic review to critically appraise and provide an evidence-based summary of the magnitude and direction of the global changes in dementia prevalence and incidence across time.","Medline, EMBASE, and PsychINFO were searched for studies focused on secular trends in dementia prevalence and\/or incidence until 18 December 2017. In total, 10,992 articles were identified and 43 retained.","Overall, prevalence rates are largely increasing (evidence primarily from record-based surveys and cohort studies in Japan, Canada, and France) or have remained stable (evidence primarily from cohort studies in Sweden, Spain and China). A significant decline in prevalence has however been reported in more recent studies (i.e., from 2010 onwards) from Europe (e.g., UK and Sweden) and the USA. Incidence rates have generally remained stable or decreased in China, Canada, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, UK, and USA. An increase has only been reported in five countries: Italy, Japan, Wales, Germany, and the Netherlands. Only one study reported findings (stability in incidence) from a low and middle-income country using data from Nigeria.","The evidence on secular trends in the prevalence and incidence of dementia is mixed including contradictory findings using different (and in some cases the same) datasets in some countries (e.g., the USA, UK, and Sweden). This making it difficult to draw concrete conclusions. However, declining trends recently observed in some high-income Western countries in the most recent two decades including the UK, USA, and Sweden are encouraging. Updated dementia prevalence and incidence estimates will inform public health and financial planning as well as development of prevention strategies."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Blossom C M","Initials":"BCM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Birdi","ForeName":"Ratika","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tang","ForeName":"Eugene Yee Hing","Initials":"EYH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cosco","ForeName":"Theodore D","Initials":"TD","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Gerontology Research Centre, Simon Fraser University, Canada."},{"Affiliation":"Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, University of Oxford, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Donini","ForeName":"Lorenzo M","Initials":"LM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Experimental Medicine, Medical Pathophysiology, Food Science and Endocrinology Section, Food Science and Human Nutrition Research Unit, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Licher","ForeName":"Silvan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ikram","ForeName":"M Arfan","Initials":"MA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus MC - University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Siervo","ForeName":"Mario","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Human Nutrition Research Centre, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Newcastle University Institute for Ageing and Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"MR\/N007921\/1","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"DEPEC 16\/137\/62","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"DRF-2015-08-006","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"NIHR-RP-011-043","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"NF-SI-0616-10054","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Global Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Incidence"},{"DescriptorName":"Prevalence"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","incidence","prevalence","secular trends","systematic review"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30347617","JAD180375","10.3233\/JAD-180375"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30247787","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"08","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"08","Day":"12"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"34","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Current approaches to dementia screening and case finding in low- and middle-income countries: Research update and recommendations.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"3-7"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.4969","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Approximately 47 million people have dementia worldwide, with this figure, it is expected to almost triple by 2050. Most people with dementia (approximately two-thirds) live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This presents a significant challenge for such countries that often have limited financial resources and less well-developed health and social care systems. In the absence of a cure, reducing the future costs of dementia care and burden of disease may be best achieved by a greater emphasis on (1) more timely diagnosis with earlier intervention to maintain functional independence and (2) undertaking \"screening\" in groups at high risk of developing dementia, case finding, and using brief cognitive assessment instruments. In clinical settings, a wide range of instruments for dementia screening and diagnosis are currently available; however, few cognitive assessment tools have been developed specifically for clinical use within LMIC settings. Screening for dementia and cognitive impairment in LMICs largely relies on tools adapted from high-income countries (HICs); these often lack validation in these settings leading to education, literacy, and cultural biases. Research is urgently needed to develop cognitive assessment tools and dementia diagnostic approaches that are appropriate and feasible for clinical use in LMIC settings.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Magklara","ForeName":"Eleni","Initials":"E","Identifier":"0000-0002-1900-7144","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Blossom C M","Initials":"BCM","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Newcastle Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","Identifier":"0000-0003-0209-2503","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health & Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Newcastle Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}]}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"16\/137\/62","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"09","Day":"24"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Dysfunction","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Developing Countries"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mass Screening","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":"methods"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["cognitive assessment","dementia","global health","low- and middle-income countries"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"11"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2018","Month":"08","Day":"06"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30247787","10.1002\/gps.4969"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30037332","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"15"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"11"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-7015","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"07","Day":"24"}},"Title":"BMC medicine","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Med"},"ArticleTitle":"The impact of dementia on service use by individuals with a comorbid health condition: a comparison of two cross-sectional analyses conducted approximately 10 years apart.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"114"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12916-018-1105-8","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The presence of concomitant medical conditions in people with dementia is common.

of anticholinergic drugs and subsequent incident dementia.","Case-control study.","General practices in the UK contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.","40\u2009770 patients aged 65-99 with a diagnosis of dementia between April 2006 and July 2015, and 283\u2009933 controls without dementia.","Daily defined doses of anticholinergic drugs coded using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale, in total and grouped by subclass, prescribed 4-20 years before a diagnosis of dementia.","Odds ratios for incident dementia, adjusted for a range of demographic and health related covariates.","14\u2009453 (35%) cases and 86\u2009403 (30%) controls were prescribed at least one anticholinergic drug with an ACB score of 3 (definite anticholinergic activity) during the exposure period. The adjusted odds ratio for any anticholinergic drug with an ACB score of 3 was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.14). Dementia was associated with an increasing average ACB score. When considered by drug class, gastrointestinal drugs with an ACB score of 3 were not distinctively linked to dementia. The risk of dementia increased with greater exposure for antidepressant, urological, and antiparkinson drugs with an ACB score of 3. This result was also observed for exposure 15-20 years before a diagnosis.","A robust association between some classes of anticholinergic drugs and future dementia incidence was observed. This could be caused by a class specific effect, or by drugs being used for very early symptoms of dementia. Future research should examine anticholinergic drug classes as opposed to anticholinergic effects intrinsically or summing scales for anticholinergic exposure.","Registered to the European Union electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies EUPAS8705."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Two-thirds of people with dementia live in the community supported by informal carers. Caring for a person with dementia has adverse effects on psychological, physical, social wellbeing and quality of life. The measurement of quality of life of carers of people with dementia is increasingly of interest to health and social care practitioners and commissioners, policymakers, and carers themselves. However, there is lack of consensus on the most suitable instrument(s) for undertaking this.","A systematic review of the literature using COSMIN methodology. Searching of electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science), reference list and citation searching of key papers was undertaken. COSMIN methodology was used to simultaneously extract data from and assess methodological quality of included studies, and make a recommendation for the instrument with the most high quality evidence for its measurement properties.","Ten instruments were suitable for inclusion in this review. The Carer well-being and support questionnaire (CWS) has the best quality evidence for the greatest number of measurement of properties. The Caregiver Well-Being Scale is also worthy of consideration. There is not presently a measure which could be recommended for use in economic evaluations, however the Impact of Alzheimer's Disease on the Caregiver questionnaire (IADCQ) could potentially be used following further investigation of its measurement properties in a representative population.","The CWS is the most appropriate instrument to recommend for the assessment of quality of life in informal carers of people with dementia at present. All instruments included in this review would benefit from more rigorous evaluation of their measurement properties."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dow","ForeName":"Johanne","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0002-3274-0121","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

about the acceptability and feasibility of proactive approaches to earlier dementia diagnosis and also identification of people at high risk of dementia.","Qualitative study using task group methodology and thematic data analysis.","Task groups were held either at the university (n=5) or at a carers' centre (n=1).","A convenience sample of 31 of 54 participants identified by local non-statutory agencies took part in a task group. All were aged between 40 years and 80 years, 21 were women and 10men participated.","Despite the use of task group methodology, participants expressed limited understandings of dementia and confusion between proactive approaches. Nevertheless, they highlighted a range of potential benefits and limitations of proactive approaches and the ethical issues raised. There was a preference to embed risk assessment within routine health checks, which focused on achieving a healthier lifestyle, rather than specifically on dementia. Participants emphasised the need to ensure informed consent prior to use of proactive approaches and to provide appropriate support. They also suggested alternative approaches that could potentially facilitate the early detection of dementia or reduce risk at a population level.","As international policy on dementia shifts towards a prevention agenda there is growing interest in identifying those at risk of developing dementia. This study provides useful insights into the acceptability of the use of such proactive approaches among the public. The introduction of proactive approaches to dementia identification raises complex practical and ethical issues, particularly in the context of low public understanding of dementia. The importance of better quality information about dementia (and the likelihood of developing dementia) and provision of psychological support for those undergoing risk assessment were highlighted."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

end-of-life care in dementia. While professional consensus on optimal palliative care in dementia has been reported, little is known about the perspectives of people with dementia and family carers.","To compare the views of people with dementia and family carers of people with dementia (current and recently bereaved) on optimal end-of-life care.","Qualitative interviews (32) and a focus group were conducted. Data were thematically analysed.","Participants comprised people with early stage dementia, living at home in the north-east of England ( n = 11); and current and bereaved carers ( n = 25) from six services providing end-of-life care in England.","Seven areas were identified as important to end-of-life care for people with dementia and\/or family carers. People with dementia and carers expressed the need for receiving care in place, ensuring comfort and a skilled care team. However, they disagreed about the importance of planning for the future and the role of families in organising care and future decision-making.","Further comparison of our findings with expert consensus views highlighted key areas of divergence and agreement. Discordant views concerning perceptions of dementia as a palliative condition, responsibility for future decision-making and the practical co-ordination of end-of-life care may undermine the provision of optimal palliative care.

This study investigated whether cognitive reserve applies to the oldest-old. This has implications for cognitive interventions in this age group.","Baseline and 5-year follow-up data from the Newcastle 85+ Study were used (N = 845, mean age = 85.5, 38% male). A Cognitive Reserve Index (CRI) was created, including: education, social class, marital status, engagement in mental activities, social participation, and physical activity. Global (Mini-Mental State Examination) and domain specific (Cognitive Drug Research Battery subtests assessing memory, attention, and speed) cognitive functions were assessed. Dementia diagnosis was determined by health records. Logistic regression analysis examined the association between CRI scores and incident dementia. Mixed effects models investigated baseline and longitudinal associations between the CRI scores and cognitive function. Analyses controlled for sex, age, depression, and cardiovascular disease history.","Higher reserve associated with better cognitive performance on all baseline measures, but not 5-year rate of change. The CRI associated with prevalent, but not incident dementia.","In the oldest-old, higher reserve associated with better baseline global and domain-specific cognitive function and reduced risk of prevalent dementia; but not cognitive decline or incident dementia. Increasing reserve could promote cognitive function in the oldest-old. The results suggest there would be little impact on trajectories, but replication is needed. Development of preventative strategies would benefit from identifying the role of each factor in building reserve and why rate of change is not

risk factors in midlife is associated with an increased risk of later life cognitive impairment and dementia. It is unclear what is driving this association but risk may be conveyed via an increase in neurodegeneration (e.g. amyloid deposition), vascular changes (e.g. small vessel disease) and mechanistically due to increased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation as well as changes in NO bioavailability.

This qualitative study explored the views and experiences of dementia care providers on the barriers and facilitators to its implementation in usual care.","Thirty four semi-structured interviews (24 participants) were conducted across four dementia care sites in the North of England; ten were follow-up interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and then mapped to the Normalization Process Theory framework.","Participants considered CST a \"good fit\" with their \"preferred\" ways of working and goals of dementia care namely the provision of person-centered services. For facilitators delivering the intervention, compared to other behavioral interventions, CST was seen to offer benefits to their work and was easy to understand as an intervention. Training in CST and seeing benefits for clients were important motivators. Time and resources were crucial for the successful implementation of CST. Participants were keen to objectively measure benefits to participants but unsure how to do this.","CST is a cost-effective psychosocial intervention for people with dementia, recommended by national guidance. Despite our findings which show that, using the NPT framework, there are more facilitators than barriers to the implementation of CST, it is still not a standard part of post-diagnostic dementia care. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for this implementation gap in ensuring evidence-based care in translated into practice."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dickinson","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle Biomedical Research Building,Campus for Ageing and Vitality,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gibson","ForeName":"Grant","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle Biomedical Research Building,Campus for Ageing and Vitality,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gotts","ForeName":"Zoe","Initials":"Z","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle Biomedical Research Building,Campus for Ageing and Vitality,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stobbart","ForeName":"Lynne","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Baddiley-Clark Building,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle Biomedical Research Building,Campus for Ageing and Vitality,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"NIHR-RP-011-043","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"13"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost-Benefit Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["cognitive stimulation therapy","community care","dementia","post-diagnostic care","psychosocial intervention"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28701238","S1041610217001272","10.1017\/S1041610217001272"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28662127","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"09","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2017"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS One"},"ArticleTitle":"Core outcome measures for interventions to prevent or slow the progress of dementia for people living with mild to moderate dementia: Systematic review and consensus recommendations.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e0179521"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0179521","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["There are no disease-modifying treatments for dementia. There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

a systematic review, patient and public consultation and consensus recommendations.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1-192"},"ELocationID":"10.3310\/hta21260","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)]. The systematic review protocol is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015027346.","The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment

experience suboptimal end of life care compared to those with cancer; with increased hospitalisation, inadequate pain control and fewer palliative care interventions. Understanding the views of those service managers and frontline staff who organise and provide care is crucial in order to develop better end of life care for people with dementia.","Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted from 2013 to 2015 with 33 service managers and 54 staff involved in frontline care, including doctors, nurses, nursing and care home managers, service development leads, senior managers\/directors, care assistants and senior care assistants\/team leads. All were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants represented a diverse range of service types and occupation. Transcripts were subject to coding and thematic analysis in data meetings. Analysis of the data led to the development of seven key themes: Recognising end of life (EOL) and tools to support end of life care (EOLC), Communicating with families about EOL, Collaborative working, Continuity of care, Ensuring comfort at EOL, Supporting families, Developing and supporting staff. Each is discussed in detail and comprise individual and collective views on approaches to good end of life care for people with dementia.","The significant challenges of providing good end of life care for people with dementia requires that different forms of expertise should be recognised and used; including the skills and knowledge of care assistants. Successfully engaging with people with dementia and family members and helping them to recognise the dying trajectory requires a supportive integration of emotional and technical expertise. The study strengthens the existing evidence base in this area and will be used with a related set of studies (on the views of other stakeholders and observations and interviews conducted in four services) to develop an evidence-based intervention."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lee","ForeName":"Richard

It is widely accepted that delirium is associated with dementia but the degree of causation within this relationship is unclear. Previous studies have been limited by incomplete ascertainment of baseline cognition or a lack of prospective delirium assessments. There is an urgent need for an improved understanding of the relationship between delirium and dementia given that delirium prevention may plausibly impact upon dementia prevention. A well-designed, observational study could also answer fundamental questions of major importance to patients and their families regarding outcomes after delirium. The Delirium and Cognitive Impact in Dementia (DECIDE) study aims to explore the association between delirium and cognitive function over time in older participants. In an existing population based cohort aged 65\u00a0years and older, the effect on cognition of an episode of delirium will be measured, independent of baseline cognition and illness severity. The predictive value of clinical parameters including delirium severity, baseline cognition and delirium subtype on cognitive outcomes following an episode of delirium will also be explored.","Over a 12\u00a0month period, surviving participants from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II-Newcastle will be screened for delirium on admission to hospital. At the point of presentation, baseline characteristics along with a number of disease relevant clinical parameters will be recorded. The progression\/resolution of delirium will be monitored. In those with and without delirium, cognitive decline and dementia will be assessed at one year follow-up. We will evaluate the effect of delirium on cognitive function over time along with the predictive value of clinical parameters.","This study will be the first to prospectively elucidate the size of the effect of delirium upon cognitive decline and incident dementia. The results will be used to inform future dementia prevention trials that focus on delirium intervention."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Richardson","ForeName":"Sarah J","Initials":"SJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Neuroscience, 3rd floor Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 5PL, UK.

practices. One such behavioural change is 'wandering', something that is often deeply feared by carers and by people with dementia themselves. Understanding how behavioural changes like wandering are experienced as problematic is critically important in current discussions about the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. In this article we draw on our secondary analysis of qualitative interviews and focus groups with carers of people with dementia to critically question 'when does walking become wandering'? Drawing on theoretical perspectives from anthropology, sociology and human geography to explore experiences of carers and of people with dementia, we argue that a conceptual shift occurs in how pedestrian activity, usually represented as something purposeful, meaningful and healthy (walking) is seen as something threatening that needs managing (wandering). We demonstrate how this shift is connected to cultural assumptions about the mind-body relationship in both walking and in dementia. We further argue that the narratives of carers about wandering challenge the notion of 'aimless' walking in the fourth age. This is because, as these narratives show, there are often pronounced links to specific areas and meaningful places where people with dementia walk to.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brittain","ForeName":"Katherine","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, Northumbria University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Degnen","ForeName":"Cathrine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Geography, Politics and Sociology, Newcastle University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gibson","ForeName":"Grant","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Applied Social Science, Stirling University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dickinson","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, Northumbria University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, Northumbria University, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"NIHR-RP-011-043","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Sociol Health Illn","NlmUniqueID":"8205036","ISSNLinking":"0141-9889"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Fear"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Walking"},{"DescriptorName":"Wandering Behavior"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","fourth age","mind-body","place attachment","sense of place","technology","walking","wandering"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28177148","10.1111\/1467-9566.12505"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28103749","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1461-7285","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"31","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02"}},"Title":"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"J Psychopharmacol"},"ArticleTitle":"Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: A revised (third) consensus statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"147-168"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/0269881116680924","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The British Association for Psychopharmacology coordinated a meeting of experts to review and revise its previous 2011 guidelines for clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs. As before, levels of evidence were rated using accepted standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A-D, with A having the strongest evidence base (from randomised controlled trials) and D the weakest (case studies or expert opinion). Current clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and both structural (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and functional (positron emission tomography and single photon emission computerised tomography) brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy in particular situations (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for cognition in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (A), memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (A) and combination therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) may be beneficial (B). Drugs should not be stopped just because dementia severity increases (A). Until further evidence is available other drugs, including statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E, nutritional supplements and Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), though selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not cognitive) features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment of people with Lewy body dementias (both Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies), and memantine may be helpful (A). No drugs are clearly effective in vascular dementia, though cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial in mixed dementia (B). Early evidence suggests multifactorial interventions may have potential to prevent or delay the onset of dementia (B). Though the consensus statement focuses on medication, psychological interventions can be effective in addition to pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel pharmacological approaches involving strategies to reduce amyloid and\/or tau deposition in those with or at high risk of Alzheimer's disease are in progress. Though results of pivotal studies in early (prodromal\/mild) Alzheimer's disease are awaited, results to date in more established (mild to moderate) Alzheimer's disease have been equivocal and no disease modifying agents are either licensed or can be currently recommended for clinical use."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Brien","ForeName":"John T","Initials":"JT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 University

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of dementia on access to non-dementia services and identify ways of improving service delivery for this population.","Qualitative study involving interviews and focus groups. Thematic content analysis was informed by theories of continuity of care and access to care.","Primary and secondary care in the South and North East of England.","PLWD who had 1 of the following comorbidities-diabetes, stroke, vision impairment, their family carers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the 3 conditions.","We recruited 28 community-dwelling PLWD, 33 family carers and 56 HCPs. Analysis resulted in 3 overarching themes: (1) family carers facilitate access to care and continuity of care, (2) the impact of the severity and presentation of dementia on management of comorbid conditions, (3) communication and collaboration across specialities and services is not dementia aware. We found examples of good practice, but these tended to be about the behaviour of individual practitioners rather than system-based approaches; current systems may unintentionally block access to care for PLWD.","This study suggests that, in order to improve access and continuity for PLWD and comorbidity, a significant change in the organisation of care is required which involves: coproduction of care where professionals, PLWD and family carers work in partnership; recognition of the way a patient's diagnosis of dementia affects the management of other long-term conditions; flexibility in services to ensure they are sensitive to the changing needs of PLWD and their family carers over time; and improved collaboration across specialities and organisations. Research is needed to develop interventions that support partnership working and tailoring of care for PLWD and comorbidity."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

poorer access to generalist and specialist palliative care than people with cancer, and experience worse outcomes in terms of pain and symptom control, and quality and experience of care. In the UK, the National Council for Palliative Care (NCPC) ran a national survey of services for end-of-life care for people with dementia (2008) in which 16 services were identified, and reported on case studies and examples of good practice. We updated the NCPC survey to review progress in previously identified services, identify factors that lead to sustainable services and identify new initiatives in this area of care.","An online survey was developed and piloted before use. Initiatives were contacted via targeted (N=63) and open call invitations. The survey was made up of 5 sections. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics.","15 services responded. They engaged in a wide range of activities predominately providing direct care (80%) and workforce development\/advisory or educational activities (87%). Results suggest that sustainability of services is reliant on clinicians with a leadership role and wider system support through funding mechanisms and a minimum level of integration within normal service provision.","Recent initiatives are largely built on the expertise of the nursing profession (with or without input from medical consultants), and driven mainly by the charity and hospice sector.

Identifying those at high risk of dementia is one approach to timely diagnosis. General practitioners (GPs) are well-placed clinicians in the community to provide both pre- and post-diagnostic dementia care. However, GPs have in the past consistently demonstrated low confidence in both diagnosing dementia and providing care for these complex patients particularly for patients in the post-diagnostic phase. It is currently unclear how future GPs view dementia care. We aimed to evaluate the current attitudes and experiences of future GPs in dementia care and their views on targeting high risk groups. All (n = 513) GP trainees were approached by email to participate in a cross-sectional web and paper-based survey in the North of England. A further reminder was sent out two months after the initial invitation. We received 153 responses (29.8% response rate, 66.7% female, average age 31 (range 25-55 years old). The main difficulties encountered included coordinating supporting services for carers and the person with dementia and responding to co-existing behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. Further education in dementia management was considered to be important by respondents. GP trainees were generally very positive about their future role in caring for people with dementia, particularly in the area of earlier diagnosis via identification of high-risk individuals. Future GPs in one area of England are very positive about their key role in dementia care. In order to facilitate the delivery of high quality, community-based care, work is required to establish core post-diagnostic dementia support services. Further research is needed to identify effective systems to enable accurate assessment and to ensure earlier diagnosis in high-risk groups."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tang","ForeName":"Eugene Yee Hing","Initials":"EYH","Identifier":"0000-0003-1030-9311","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Birdi","ForeName":"Ratika","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"08","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"General Practitioners","QualifierName":["psychology","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia","community care","dementia","education","primary care"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27502828","S1041610216001204","10.1017\/S1041610216001204"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27341812","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"14"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"24"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 to enable person-centred care for people with dementia and their carers (DCM-EPIC) in care homes: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"300"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s13063-016-1416-z","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Up to 90 % of people living with dementia in care homes experience one or more behaviours that staff may describe as challenging to support (BSC). Of these agitation is the most common and difficult to manage. The presence of agitation is associated with fewer visits from relatives, poorer quality of life and social isolation. It is recommended that agitation is treated through psychosocial interventions. Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 (DCM\u2122) is an established, widely used observational tool and practice development cycle, for ensuring a systematic approach to providing person-centred care. There is a body of practice-based literature and experience to suggests that DCM\u2122 is potentially effective but limited robust evidence for its effectiveness, and no examination of its cost-effectiveness, as a UK health care intervention. Therefore, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of DCM\u2122 in the UK is urgently needed.","A pragmatic, multi-centre, cluster-randomised controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM\u2122) plus Usual Care (UC) versus UC alone, where UC is the normal care delivered within the care home following a minimum level of dementia awareness training. The trial will take place in residential, nursing and dementia-specialist care homes across West Yorkshire, Oxfordshire and London, with residents with dementia. A random sample of 50 care homes will be selected within which a minimum of 750 residents will be registered. Care homes will be randomised in an allocation ratio of 3:2 to receive either intervention or control. Outcome measures will be obtained at 6 and 16 months following randomisation. The primary outcome is agitation as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, at 16 months post randomisation. Key secondary outcomes are other BSC and quality of life. There will be an integral cost-effectiveness analysis and a process evaluation.","The protocol was refined following a pilot of trial procedures. Changes include replacement of a questionnaire, whose wording caused some residents distress, to an adapted version specifically designed for use in care homes, a change to the randomisation stratification factors, adaption in how the staff measures are collected to encourage greater compliance, and additional reminders to intervention homes of when mapping cycles are due, via text message.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82288852 .

carers and general practitioners (GPs) on their knowledge and experience of accessing information about, and use of, assistive technology (AT) in dementia care.","Qualitative methods with semistructured interviews and thematic analysis.","56 participants comprising 17 GPs, 13 people with dementia and 26 family carers.","Community care settings in the North East of England.","4 main themes emerged: awareness and experience of AT; accessing information on AT; roles and responsibilities in the current care system and the future commissioning of AT services. All participants had practical experience of witnessing AT being used in practice. For people with dementia and their families, knowledge was usually gained from personal experience rather than from health and social care professionals. For GPs, knowledge was largely gained through experiential, patient-led learning. All groups acknowledged the important role of the voluntary sector but agreed a need for clear information pathways for AT; such pathways were perceived to be essential to both service providers and service commissioners.","People with dementia and their family carers appear to be mainly responsible for driving a gradual increase in both awareness and the use of AT in dementia care. GPs should be equipped with the relevant knowledge to ensure families living with dementia receive appropriate information and support to enable them to live independently for as long as possible. There is an urgent need to simplify current complex community care pathways; as demonstrated in other chronic health conditions, a single point of access and a named lead professional may improve future care."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

dementia is seen to be a policy and practice imperative and a necessary step in order to live well with the condition. However, limited understanding exists regarding the personal and relational meanings attributed to the diagnostic experience. Drawn from the findings of a larger multi-site study conducted in four areas of England, this article presents a subset of the data where five participants and their carers and two people living alone initially presented themselves at a memory clinic for diagnostic testing, with this presentation eventually resulting in a confirmed, and shared, diagnosis of dementia. All 12 participants were interviewed at two time points in the study: at the time of first presentation to the memory clinic and shortly after the diagnosis had been shared with them. Informed by the grounded theory method, constant comparative analysis was applied to the data and this process resulted in a four-phase sequential model of diagnostic transition: (1) becoming self-aware\u2192seeking outside help; (2) being referred\u2192receiving a clinic appointment; (3) undergoing tests\u2192being told what's wrong; and (4) adjusting to the diagnosis\u2192negotiating everyday expectations. Running through each phase was the core category of 'living with uncertainty' which summarised the entire diagnostic journey for all study participants. Findings suggest a need for better awareness and information for people living with dementia at all phases and time points in the condition, which may be fostered by embedding these in early clinical encounters.

However, these projections have not taken into account the role of modifiable risk factors and whether any prevention strategies might influence the predicted trend. Attempts at pharmacological disease modification have largely been disappointing, and the difficulties in conducting dementia trials are reviewed here. In contrast, recent population studies in high-income countries suggest that the epidemiology may be changing with a possible decline in incident dementia, or even a reduction in age-specific prevalence. Therefore, efforts to develop public health interventions may prove to be the more successful approach to addressing dementia at a societal level.

People with advanced dementia experience similar symptoms to those dying with cancer yet professional carers find prognostication difficult and struggle to meet palliative care needs, with physical symptoms undetected and untreated. While elements of good practice in this area have been identified in theory, the factors which enable such good practice to be implemented in real world practice need to be better understood. The aim of this study was to determine expert views on the key factors influencing good practice in end of life care for people with dementia.","Semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews with topic guide, verbatim transcription and thematic analysis. Interviews were conducted with experts in dementia care and\/or palliative care in England (n = 30).","Four key factors influencing good practice in end of life care for people with dementia were identified from the expert interviews: leadership and management of care, integrating clinical expertise, continuity of care, and use of guidelines.","The relationships between the four key factors are important. Leadership and management of care have implications for the successful implementation of guidelines, while the appropriate and timely use of clinical expertise could prevent hospitalisation and ensure continuity of care. A lack of integration across health and social care can undermine continuity of care. Further work is needed to understand how existing guidelines and tools contribute to good practice.","This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research programme (Grant Reference Number RP-PG-0611-20005).

study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"89"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12877-015-0091-3","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Assistive Technology (AT) has been suggested as a means by which people with dementia can be helped to live independently, while also leading to greater efficiencies in care. However little is known about how AT is being used by people with dementia and their carers in their daily routines. This paper reports on a qualitative study exploring the everyday use of AT by people with dementia and their families.","The research employed a qualitative methodology. Semi structured interviews took place with 39 participants, 13 people with dementia and 26 carers. Key themes were identified using thematic analysis and the constant comparative method.","Three categories of AT use in everyday settings were identified; formal AT, accessed via social care services, 'off the shelf AT' purchased privately, and 'do it yourself' AT, everyday household products adapted by families to fulfil individual need in the absence of specific devices. Access to AT was driven by carers, with the majority of benefits being experienced by carers. Barriers to use included perceptions about AT cost; dilemmas about the best time to use AT; and a lack of information and support from formal health and social care services about how to access AT, where to source it and when and how it can be used.","It has been argued that the 'mixed economy' landscape, with private AT provision supplementing state provision of AT, is a key feature for the mainstreaming of AT services. Our data suggests that such a mixed economy is indeed taking place, with more participants using 'off the shelf' and 'DIY' AT purchased privately rather than via health and social care services. However this system has largely arisen due to an inability of formal care services to meet client needs. Such findings therefore raise questions about just who AT in its current provision is working for and whether a mixed market approach is the most appropriate provider model. Everyday technologies play an important role in supporting families with dementia to continue caring; further research is needed however to determine the most effective and person-centred models for future AT provision."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gibson","ForeName":"Grant","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of

with poor cognitive function and incident dementia. Whether cardiovascular disease prediction models, developed to predict an individual's risk of future cardiovascular disease or stroke, are also informative for predicting risk of cognitive decline and dementia is not known.","The objective of this systematic review was to compare cohort studies examining the association between cardiovascular disease risk models and longitudinal changes in cognitive function or risk of incident cognitive impairment or dementia.","Medline, PsychINFO, and Embase were searched from inception to March 28, 2014. From 3,413 records initially screened, 21 were included.","The association between numerous different cardiovascular disease risk models and cognitive outcomes has been tested, including Framingham and non-Framingham risk models. Five studies examined dementia as an outcome; fourteen studies examined cognitive decline or incident cognitive impairment as an outcome; and two studies examined both dementia and cognitive changes as outcomes. In all studies, higher cardiovascular disease risk scores were associated with cognitive changes or risk of dementia. Only four studies reported model prognostic performance indices, such as Area Under the Curve (AUC), for predicting incident dementia or cognitive impairment and these studies all examined non-Framingham Risk models (AUC range: 0.74 to 0.78).","Cardiovascular risk prediction models are associated with cognitive changes over time and risk of dementia.

qualitative study using Normalization Process Theory.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"549"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12913-014-0549-6","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Case management has been suggested as a way of improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of support for people with dementia. In this study we adapted and implemented a successful United States' model of case management in primary care in England. The results are reported elsewhere, but a key finding was that little case management took place. This paper reports the findings of the process evaluation which used Normalization Process Theory to understand the barriers to implementation.","Ethnographic methods were used to explore the views and experiences of case management. Interviews with 49 stakeholders (patients, carers, case managers, health and social care professionals) were supplemented with observation of case managers during meetings and initial assessments with patients. Transcripts and field notes were analysed initially using the constant comparative approach and emerging themes were then mapped onto the framework of Normalization Process Theory.","The primary focus during implementation was on the case managers as isolated individuals, with little attention being paid to the social or organizational context within which they worked. Barriers relating to each of the four main constructs of Normalization Process Theory were identified, with a lack of clarity over the scope and boundaries of the intervention (coherence); variable investment in the intervention (cognitive participation); a lack of resources, skills and training to deliver case management (collective action); and limited reflection and feedback on the case manager role (reflexive monitoring).","Despite the intuitive appeal of case management to all stakeholders, there were multiple barriers to implementation in primary care in England including: difficulties in embedding case managers within existing well-established community networks; the challenges of protecting time for case management; and case managers' inability to identify, and act on, emerging patient and carer needs (an essential, but previously unrecognised, training need). In the light of these barriers it is unclear whether primary care is the most appropriate setting for case management in England. The process evaluation highlights key aspects of implementation and training to be addressed in future studies of case management for dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bamford","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

comorbid medical conditions and related complaints. The presence of dementia may complicate clinical care for other conditions and undermine a patient's ability to manage a chronic condition. The aim of this study was to scope the extent, range and nature of research activity around dementia and comorbidity.","We undertook a scoping review including all types of research relating to the prevalence of comorbidities in people with dementia; current systems, structures and other issues relating to service organisation and delivery; patient and carer experiences; and the experiences and attitudes of service providers. We searched AMED, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, NHS Evidence, Scopus, Google Scholar (searched 2012, Pubmed updated 2013), checked reference lists and performed citation searches on PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to February 2014).","We included 54 primary studies, eight reviews and three guidelines. Much of the available literature relates to the prevalence of comorbidities in people with dementia or issues around quality of care. Less is known about service organisation and delivery or the views and experiences of people with dementia and their family carers. There is some evidence that people with dementia did not have the same access to treatment and monitoring for conditions such as visual impairment and diabetes as those with similar comorbidities but without dementia.","The prevalence of comorbid conditions in people with dementia is high. Whilst current evidence suggests that people with dementia may have poorer access to services the reasons for this are not clear. There is a need for more research looking at the ways in which having dementia impacts on clinical care for other conditions and how the process of care and different services are adapting to the needs of people with dementia and comorbidity. People with dementia should be included in the debate about the management of comorbidities in older populations and there needs to be greater consideration given to including them in studies that focus on age-related healthcare issues."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for

The National Dementia Strategy for England recommended Dementia Adviser (DA) and Peer Support Network (PSN) services and 40 demonstration sites were established. In this paper, we report on the national evaluation of these demonstration sites, with specific reference to aspects of organisational development. The research used a mixed-methods design with three main strands: (i) activity and outcome monitoring; (ii) organisational surveys and collaborative discussion; (iii) in-depth case studies in eight of the 40 sites. This paper focuses primarily on three rounds of organisational surveys distributed to all 40 demonstration sites over a period of 21 months and interviews in the case studies. Data identify the significance of infrastructure within immediate services as well as the position of services within the external infrastructure of the wider health and social care landscape. Partnership - both internally and externally - was key to establishing and sustaining services that flourished. When working well, DAs and PSNs acted as a link between services and people with dementia at the same time as filling gaps in existing support, providing information, advice and interpersonal support that was tailored to individual needs and circumstances. In conclusion, to achieve the full potential and sustainability of services requires them to be in an organisational space that allows them to work in partnership and collaboration with other services, and that values their distinct knowledge of their communities.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clarke","ForeName":"Charlotte Laura","Initials":"CL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health in Social Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keyes","ForeName":"Sarah Elizabeth","Initials":"SE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilkinson","ForeName":"Heather","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alexjuk","ForeName":"Joanna","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcockson","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corner","ForeName":"Lynne","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cattan","ForeName":"Mima","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"NIHR-RP-011-043","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"09","Day":"22"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cooperative Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Plan Implementation","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Organizational Innovation"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"State Medicine"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia Advisers","dementia","organisational development","peer support","strategy","sustainability"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2014","Month":"06","Day":"20"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"9","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"9","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"7","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25243927","10.1111\/hsc.12134"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25138151","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"05","Day":"08"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2046-4924","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"52","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"Health technology assessment (Winchester, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Technol Assess"},"ArticleTitle":"The effectiveness of collaborative care for people with memory problems in primary care: results of the CAREDEM case management modelling and feasibility study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1-148"},"ELocationID":"10.3310\/hta18520","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["People with dementia and their families need support in different forms, but currently services are often fragmented with variable quality of care. Case management offers a way of co-ordinating services along the care pathway and therefore could provide individualised support; however, evidence of the effectiveness of case management for dementia is inconclusive.","To adapt the intervention used in a promising case management project in the USA and test its feasibility and acceptability in English general practice.","In work package 1, a design group of varied professionals, with a carer and staff from the voluntary sector, met six times over a year to identify the skills and personal characteristics required for case management; protocols from the US study were adapted for use in the UK. The feasibility of recruiting general practices and patient-carer dyads and of delivering case management were tested in a pilot study (work package 2). An embedded qualitative study explored stakeholder views on study procedures and case management.","Four general practices, two in the north-east of England (Newcastle) one in London and one in Norfolk, took part in a feasibility pilot study of case management.","Community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers who were not already being case managed by other services.","A social worker shared by the two practices in the north-east and practice nurses in the other two practices were trained to deliver case management. We aimed to recruit 11 people with dementia from each practice who were not already being case managed.","Numbers of people with dementia and their carers recruited, numbers and content of contacts, needs identified and perceptions of case management among stakeholders.","Recruitment of practices and patients was slow and none of the practices achieved its recruitment target. It took more than 6 months to recruit a total of 28 people with dementia. Practice Quality and Outcome Framework registers for dementia contained only 60% of the expected number of people, most living in care homes. All stakeholders were positive about the potential of case management; however, only one of the four practices achieved a level of case management activity that might have influenced patient and carer outcomes. Case managers' activity levels were not related solely to time available for case management. Delivery of case management was hindered by limited clarity about the role, poor integration with existing services and a lack of embeddedness within primary care. There were discrepancies between case manager and researcher judgements about need, and evidence of a high threshold for acting on unmet need. The practice nurses experienced difficulties in ring-fencing case management time.","The model of case management developed and evaluated in this feasibility study is unlikely to be sustainable in general practice under current conditions and in our view it would not be appropriate to attempt a definitive trial of this model. This study could inform the development of a case management role with a greater likelihood of impact. Different approaches to recruiting and training case managers, and identifying people with dementia who might benefit from case management, are needed, as is exploration of the scale of need for this type of working.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN74015152.","This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 18, No. 52.

services currently available for people with dementia within the United Kingdom. A scoping review of assistive technology products and services currently available highlighted 171 products or product types and 331 services. In addition, we assimilated data on the amount and quality of information provided by assistive technology services alongside assistive technology costs. We identify a range of products available across three areas: assistive technology used 'by', 'with' and 'on' people with dementia. Assistive technology provision is dominated by 'telecare' provided by local authorities, with services being subject to major variations in pricing and information provision; few currently used available resources for assistive technology in dementia. We argue that greater attention should be paid to information provision about assistive technology services across an increasingly mixed economy of dementia care providers, including primary care, local authorities, private companies and local\/national assistive technology resources.

Rightly or wrongly, if a degree of confusion is apparent, it is often questioned whether the person is able to return to the previous place of residence. We wished to understand how, on medical wards, judgements about capacity and best interests with respect to going home are made for people with dementia and how decision-making around hospital discharge for people with dementia and their families might be improved. Our research reflects the jurisdiction in which we work, but the importance of residence capacity rests on its implications for basic human rights.","The research employed a ward-based ethnography. Observational data were captured through detailed fieldnotes, in-depth interviews, medical-record review and focus groups. Themes and key issues were identified using constant comparative analysis of 29 cases. Theoretical sampling of key stakeholders was undertaken, including patients with dementia (with and without residence capacity), their relatives and a range of practitioners. The research was carried out in three hospital wards (acute and rehabilitation) in two hospitals within two National Health Service (NHS) healthcare trusts in the North of England over a period of nine months between 2008 and 2009.","Our analysis highlights the complexity of judgements about capacity and best interests in relation to decisions about place of residence for people with dementia facing discharge from hospital. Five key themes emerged from data: the complexity of borderline decisions; the requirement for better understanding of assessment approaches in relation to residence capacity; the need for better documentation; the importance of narrative; and the crucial relevance of time and timing in making these decisions.","We need: more support and training for practitioners, as well as support for patients and families; clarity about the information to be imparted to the person with dementia; more advocacy for people with dementia; appropriate assessments embedded in routine clinical practice; the patient with dementia to be centre-stage; and properly resourced step-down or rehabilitation units to facilitate timely and good decision-making about place of residence."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Poole","ForeName":"Marie","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bond","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Emmett","ForeName":"Charlotte","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Greener","ForeName":"Helen","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Louw","ForeName":"Stephen

stakeholders increasingly recognize that the scientific and economic challenges associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are simply too great for individual stakeholder groups to address solely from within their own silos. In the necessary spirit of collaboration, we present in this perspective a set of multicountry multistakeholder recommendations to improve the organization of existing AD and dementia care and the development of new treatments. In brief, the five recommendations are (1) health-care systems must make choices regarding the patient populations to be diagnosed and treated, (2) health-care systems should use an evidence-based standard of care, (3) increased collaboration between public and private institutions is needed to enhance research, (4) reimbursement end points need to be agreed on and validated, and (5) innovative business models should be used to spur the introduction of new medicines.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Alzheimer's Association.

It was central to the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy (NDS) for England, when 40 demonstration sites were established. This mixed-methods study included in-depth qualitative interviews with people living with dementia (n\u2009=\u2009101) and staff\/stakeholders (n\u2009=\u200982) at 8 of the 40 sites. Data analysis was a five-stage process: coding framework developed (using 25 transcripts); further development of the framework (using a further 70 transcripts); development of emerging themes; modelling of themes and verification of models based on the entire data set. Peer support had positive emotional and social impact that was rooted in identification with others, a commonality of experience and reciprocity of support. There was also a contrast between the quality of peer support and support from professionals. This emphasises the significance of lived experience and promoting a strength-based approach to interpersonal support that is enabling and challenges a deficit approach to understanding dementia.

Contemporary estimates are needed to plan for future care provision, but much evidence is decades old. We aimed to investigate whether the prevalence of dementia had changed in the past two decades by repeating the same approach and diagnostic methods as used in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS) in three of the original study areas in England.","Between 1989 and 1994, MRC CFAS investigators did baseline interviews in populations aged 65 years and older in six geographically defined areas in England and Wales. A two stage process, with screening followed by diagnostic assessment, was used to obtain data for algorithmic diagnoses (geriatric mental state-automated geriatric examination for computer assisted taxonomy), which were then used to estimate dementia prevalence. Data from three of these areas--Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham--were selected for CFAS I. Between 2008 and 2011, new fieldwork was done in the same three areas for the CFAS II study. For both CFAS I and II, each area needed to include 2500 individuals aged 65 years and older to provide power for geographical and generational comparison. Sampling was stratified according to age group (65-74 years vs \u226575 years). CFAS II used identical sampling, approach, and diagnostic methods to CFAS I, except that screening and assessement were combined into one stage. Prevalence estimates were calculated using inverse probability weighting methods to adjust for sampling design and non-response. Full likelihood Bayesian models were used to investigate informative non-response.","7635 people aged 65 years or older were interviewed in CFAS I (9602 approached, 80% response) in Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed. In the same geographical areas, the CFAS II investigators interviewed 7796 individuals (14,242 approached, 242 with limited frailty information, 56% response). Using CFAS I age and sex specific estimates of prevalence in individuals aged 65 years or older, standardised to the 2011 population, 8\u00b73% (884,000) of this population would be expected to have dementia in 2011. However, CFAS II shows that the prevalence is lower (6\u00b75%; 670,000), a decrease of 1\u00b78% (odds ratio for CFAS II vs CFAS I 0\u00b77, 95% CI 0\u00b76-0\u00b79, p=0\u00b7003). Sensitivity analyses suggest that these estimates are robust to the change in response.","This study provides further evidence that a cohort effect exists in dementia prevalence. Later-born populations have a lower risk of prevalent dementia than those born earlier in the past century.","UK Medical Research Council."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 Matthews et al.

currently services are fragmented and the quality of care is variable. Case management is a popular approach to care co-ordination, but evidence to date on its effectiveness in dementia has been equivocal. Case management interventions need to be designed to overcome obstacles to care co-ordination and maximise benefit. A successful case management methodology was adapted from the United States (US) version for use in English primary care, with a view to a definitive trial. Medical Research Council guidance on the development of complex interventions was implemented in the adaptation process, to capture the skill sets, person characteristics and learning needs of primary care based case managers.","Co-design of the case manager role in a single NHS provider organisation, with external peer review by professionals and carers, in an iterative technology development process.","The generic skills and personal attributes were described for practice nurses taking up the case manager role in their workplaces, and for social workers seconded to general practice teams, together with a method of assessing their learning needs. A manual of information material for people with dementia and their family carers was also created using the US intervention as its source.","Co-design produces rich products that have face validity and map onto the complexities of dementia and of health and care services. The feasibility of the case manager role, as described and defined by this process, needs evaluation in 'real life'

care while they have capacity.","To explore professionals' experiences on the implementation of advance care planning in two areas of clinical care, dementia and palliative care.","Qualitative study, focus groups and individual interviews.","North East of England.","Ninety-five participants from one Primary Care Trust, two acute National Health Service Hospital Trusts, one Ambulance Trust, one Local Authority and voluntary organisations and the legal sector.","Fourteen focus groups and 18 interviews were held with 95 participants. While professionals agreed that advance care planning was a good idea in theory, implementation in practice presented them with significant challenges. The majority expressed uncertainty over the general value of advance care planning, whether current service provision could meet patient wishes, their individual roles and responsibilities and which aspects of advance care planning were legally binding; the array of different advance care planning forms and documentation available added to the confusion. In dementia care, the timing of when to initiate advance care planning discussions was an added challenge.","This study has identified the professional, organisational and legal factors that influence advance care planning implementation; professional training should target these specific areas. There is an urgent need for standardisation of advance care planning documentation. Greater clarity is also required on the roles and responsibilities of different professional groups. More complex aspects of advance care planning may be better carried out by those with specialist skills and experience than by generalists caring for a wide range of patient groups with different disease trajectories."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. a.l.robinson@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dickinson","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bamford","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clark","ForeName":"Alexa","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hughes","ForeName":"Julian","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Exley","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Palliat Med","NlmUniqueID":"8704926","ISSNLinking":"0269-2163"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Palliat Med. 2013 May;27(5):387-8","PMID":"23630187"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Advance Care Planning","QualifierName":"legislation & jurisprudence"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Palliative Care","QualifierName":["legislation & jurisprudence","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23175508","0269216312465651","10.1177\/0269216312465651"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23118618","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"02","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1549-1676","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"9","Issue":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"PLoS medicine","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS Med"},"ArticleTitle":"Psychosocial factors that shape patient and carer experiences of dementia diagnosis and treatment: a systematic review of qualitative studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e1001331"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pmed.1001331","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Early diagnosis and intervention for people with dementia is increasingly considered a priority, but practitioners are concerned with the effects of earlier diagnosis and interventions on patients and caregivers. This systematic review evaluates the qualitative evidence about how people accommodate and adapt to the diagnosis of dementia and its immediate consequences, to guide practice.","We systematically reviewed qualitative studies exploring experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia, and their carers, around diagnosis and the transition to becoming a person with dementia. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index (all searched in May 2010 with no date restrictions; PubMed search updated in February 2012), checked reference lists, and undertook citation searches in PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to September 2011). We used thematic synthesis to identify key themes, commonalities, barriers to earlier diagnosis, and support identified as helpful. We identified 126 papers reporting 102 studies including a total of 3,095 participants. Three overarching themes emerged from our analysis: (1) pathways through diagnosis, including its impact on identity, roles, and relationships; (2) resolving conflicts to accommodate a diagnosis, including the acceptability of support, focusing on the present or the future, and the use or avoidance of knowledge; and (3) strategies and support to minimise the impact of dementia. Consistent barriers to diagnosis include stigma, normalisation of symptoms, and lack of knowledge. Studies report a lack of specialist support particularly post-diagnosis.","There is an extensive body of qualitative literature on the experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia on receiving and adapting to a diagnosis of dementia. We present a thematic analysis that could be useful to professionals working with people with dementia. We suggest that research emphasis should shift towards the development and evaluation of interventions, particularly those providing support after diagnosis."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for

In dementia, guidance stipulates that ACP discussions should take place whilst the person still has capacity to make decisions. However there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of ACP in influencing patient choice and resource use.

The conduct of the systematic review will follow current best practice guidance. In phases 2 and 3, focus groups will be employed to seek the perspectives of the professionals; individual interviews will be carried out with people with dementia and their carers. Data from Phases 1, 2 and 3 will be synthesised in a series of team workshops to develop draft guidance and educational tools for implementing ACP in practice (Phase 4).","In the UK, there is little published research on the effectiveness of ACP, despite its introduction into policy. This study was designed to explore in greater depth how ACP can best be carried out in routine practice. It affords the opportunity to develop both a theoretical and practical understanding of an area which both patients and professionals may find emotionally challenging. Importantly the study will also develop practical tools, which are grounded in practice, for all relevant stakeholders to enable the facilitation of timely and sensitive ACP

lived experiences of older people with dementia, in relation to everyday technologies in public spaces outside the home, through re-analysis of qualitative data generated from research that focused on the use of technology in supporting people with dementia to carry on with their everyday outside activities. The data have been re-analysed to critically examine how people with memory loss manage being outside in both familiar and unfamiliar public environments. In doing so the authors explore how technologies mediate between the physical and social environment in which people with dementia live. This paper highlights the importance of a neglected space within dementia research, namely the outside public environment. Although the outside environment and activities that take place in that space, for some, are curtailed, for others the physical and social security of familiar environments enables them to carry on with everyday activities in this public realm. Outside space can be both therapeutic and frightening and this paper demonstrates that people with dementia can sometimes feel out of place in public space. It however also shows the variety of ways people with dementia use everyday technologies to manage 'feeling out of place'."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brittain","ForeName":"Katherine","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corner","ForeName":"Lynne","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bond","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2009","Month":"12","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Sociol Health Illn","NlmUniqueID":"8205036","ISSNLinking":"0141-9889"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Age Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Geography"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Environment"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Technology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20003041","SHIL1203","10.1111\/j.1467-9566.2009.01203.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19946862","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"01","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"25","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Primary care and dementia: 2.

The systematic follow-up of both people with dementia and their carers should be integrated into primary care. Reframing dementia, with an emphasis on abilities retained may allow people with dementia and their families to develop more effective coping strategies; an increase in skill mix within primary care is required to deliver this and may also improve the management of behavioural problems. The potential benefits of person-centred interventions, like advance care planning, and alternative models of service delivery, such as a structured, collaborative care approach which promotes integrated case management within primary care, require further evaluation."],"CopyrightInformation":"(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. a.l.robinson@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ashley","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moniz-Cook","ForeName":"Esme","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"DeNDRoN Primary Care Clinical Studies Group"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MC_U122797163","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Case Management","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Health Education"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Physician's Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"12","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"12","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19946862","10.1002\/gps.2405"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19615123","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"03","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Improving patient-centered care for people with dementia in medical encounters: an educational intervention for old age psychiatrists.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"129-38"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610209990482","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Health care professionals are recommended to deliver patient-centered care in dementia; however, guidance and training on how to do this in practice is currently lacking.

We also interviewed participants from (ii) including 7 old age psychiatrists, 25 people with dementia and 44 carers. From this we developed a workshop for old age psychiatrists and piloted and evaluated it. Pre- and post-workshop questionnaires were completed; the latter included an assessment of planned and subsequent behavior change by participants.","The educational workshop, attended by 41 old age psychiatrists, focused on how best to structure the consultation and the most effective communication skills to use in consultation with people with dementia. Three months after the workshop, 59% had made one or more changes to the structure of their consultations, 71% had used new communication skills and 56% had reflected further on their practice.","We developed an educational intervention with both a theoretical and empirical basis.

Dementia is probably under-diagnosed and under treated with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary care physicians. This problem of under-diagnosis is probably not due to lack of diagnostic skills, but rather to the interaction of case-complexity, pressure on time and the negative effects of reimbursement systems. Primary care physicians often over-estimate the prevalence of dementia syndromes, but in some countries may also overestimate the prevalence of vascular dementia compared with Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosis is a step-wise process which can be aided by use of a cognitive function test, of which there are a number suitable for primary care use. Evidence based practice protocols can enhance detection rates in primary care, and there is growing evidence that communication skills in talking to people with dementia about dementia can be improved. Nevertheless there are multiple obstacles to bringing recognition forward in time, both in public awareness and professional understanding of the early changes in dementia.","There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify population screening in primary care but earlier recognition of people with dementia syndrome is possible within primary care. The diagnosis of dementia is a shared responsibility between generalist and specialist disciplines. Primary care physicians should explore patients' ideas and concerns around their symptoms prior to referral and tentatively discuss possible diagnoses. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the primary care physician should provide both practical and emotional support to allow the patient and their family to come to terms with living with dementia, and refer them for additional psychosocial support if required."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care for Older People, University College London, London, NW3 2PF, UK. s.iliffe@pcps.ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ashley","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"DeNDRoN Primary Care Clinical Studies Group"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MC_U122797163","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Physician-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"66"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19226529","10.1002\/gps.2204"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19193255","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"06","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1041-6102","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Keeping In Touch Everyday (KITE) project: developing assistive technologies with people with dementia and their carers to promote independence.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"494-502"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610209008448","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The role of technology to facilitate independent living for people with dementia is not fully realized, with initial attempts (e.g. tracking devices) being considered unacceptable from a practical and ethical perspective.

to September 2003 (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science). Additional references were identified through hand searches of selected journals and bibliographies of relevant articles and books. The title and abstract of each identified paper were reviewed independently by two reviewers against pre-determined inclusion criteria: original data about disclosure were presented and the paper was in English. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a structured abstraction form. Data quality were not formally assessed although each study was critically reviewed in terms of methodology, sampling criteria, response rates and appropriateness of analysis.","Fifty-nine papers met the inclusion criteria for detailed review.
