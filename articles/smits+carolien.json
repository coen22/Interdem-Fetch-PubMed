Decision making was guided by the wishes of the PWD, but their actual involvement decreased over time.","Results show that while the IP-SDM model was helpful, the options change with cognitive decline and moving to a nursing home can become inevitable in spite of preferences.","Timely and honest communication helps to mitigate the distress of deciding against patient preferences, as could advance care planning about future housing transitions."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Shared decision making is the preferred way of involving people in decisions. Our study aimed to describe the challenges of shared decision making in dementia care networks.","A multi-perspective qualitative study using face-to-face interviews with 113 respondents in 23 care networks in the Netherlands consisting of 23 people with dementia, 44 of their informal caregivers, and 46 of their professional caregivers. The interview guide addressed the decision topics, who were involved in the decision making and their contributions to the decision making. We used content analysis to delineate categories and themes.","The themes and categories that emerged are: (1) adapting to a situation of diminishing independence, which includes the continuous changes in the care network, resulting in shifting decision-making roles and the need for anticipating future decisions; and (2) tensions in network interactions which result from different perspectives and interests and which require reaching agreement about what constitutes a problem by exchanging information in the care network.","The challenges in dementia care networks relate to all dimensions of social health. They have implications for a model of shared decision making in dementia care networks. Such a model requires flexibility regarding changing capabilities to preserve the autonomy of the person with dementia. It needs working towards a shared view about what constitutes a problem in the situation. It asks for professionals to advocate for the involvement of people with dementia by helping them participate in ways that strengthen their remaining capacities."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Groen-van de Ven","ForeName":"Leontine","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Group Innovating with Older Adults,Centre of Expertise in Health Care and Social Work,Windesheim University of Applied Sciences,8000 GB,Zwolle,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smits","ForeName":"Carolien","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Group Innovating with Older Adults,Centre of Expertise in Health Care and Social Work,Windesheim University of Applied Sciences,8000 GB,Zwolle,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Span","ForeName":"Marijke","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Group Innovating with Older Adults,Centre of Expertise in Health Care and Social Work,Windesheim University of Applied Sciences,8000 GB,Zwolle,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jukema","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Group Innovating with Older Adults,Centre of Expertise in Health Care and Social Work,Windesheim University of Applied Sciences,8000 GB,Zwolle,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coppoolse","ForeName":"Krista","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Centre Innovations in Care,Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences,3001 HA,Rotterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Lange","ForeName":"Jacomine","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Centre Innovations in Care,Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences,3001 HA,Rotterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing Home Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,Free University Medical Centre,Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ healthcare),Radboud Alzheimer Centre,Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre,6500 HB,Nijmegen,the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"09","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Networking"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia care networks","involvement in decision making","qualitative study"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"9","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"9","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27609338","S1041610216001381","10.1017\/S1041610216001381"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27401681","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"17"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1552-7573","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"39","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"10"}},"Title":"Research on aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Res Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"Decision Trajectories in Dementia Care Networks: Decisions and Related Key Events.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1039-1071"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/0164027516656741","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This prospective multiperspective study provides insight into the decision trajectories of people with dementia by studying the decisions made and related key events.

Our multilayered qualitative analysis consists of content analysis, timeline methods, and constant comparison. Four decision themes emerged-managing daily life, arranging support, community living, and preparing for the future. Eight key events delineate the decision trajectories of people with dementia. Decisions and key events differ between people with dementia living alone and living with a caregiver.
