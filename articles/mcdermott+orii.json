Although there is a rapidly growing amount of research in this relatively new area, it has evolved largely independently within different fields, such as psychology, music therapy and nursing. Using principles from the meta-narrative review method, this paper systematically surveys the qualitative and quantitative measures which have been used in studies relating to music and dementia from 1980 to the present day. Data extracted include the outcome measures used, the type of musical interventions, the setting of the studies, and methodology and study design. The quantitative studies greatly outnumber the qualitative studies, and most research has been done in long-term care settings. Instruments which measure neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, especially agitation, were the most frequently used. Other domains that were targeted in the studies included quality of life, physiological change, music-related outcomes and cognitive skills; the inter-relations between these domains are represented as a diagram. Researchers' rationales for choosing to target these outcomes are discussed. Although reduction of neuropsychiatric symptoms is a valuable outcome, it is important that researchers are open to the possibility of other outcomes. We suggest that measuring an increase in positive responses might be an alternative to measuring a reduction of negative symptoms, and we highlight the importance of listening to people with dementia and carers when designing studies.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.

recent years. In addition to clinical work with clients, music therapists are often required to support and train staff, families, and volunteers and skill-share some music therapeutic skills. Six music therapy researchers from six countries agreed it was timely to organize a roundtable and share their indirect music therapy practice and examples of skill-sharing in dementia care. This article was developed following the roundtable at the World Congress of Music Therapy in 2017 and further discussion among the authors. This process highlighted the diversity and complexity of indirect music therapy practice and skill-sharing, but some common components emerged, including: 1) the importance of making clinical decisions about when direct music therapy is necessary and when indirect music therapy is appropriate, 2) supporting the transition from direct music therapy to indirect music therapy, 3) the value of music therapy skill-sharing in training care home staff, 4) the need for considering potential risks and burdens of indirect music therapy practice, and 5) expanding the role of music therapist and cultivating cross-professional dialogues to support organizational changes. In indirect music therapy practice, a therapist typically works with carers and supporters to strengthen their relationships with people with dementia and help them further develop their self-awareness and sense of competence. However, the ultimate goal of indirect music therapy practice in dementia care remains the wellbeing of people living with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McDermott","ForeName":"Orii","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Nottingham and Aalborg University."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ridder","ForeName":"Hanne Mette","Initials":"HM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Aalborg University."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baker","ForeName":"Felicity Anne","Initials":"FA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Melbourne."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wosch","ForeName":"Thomas","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ray","ForeName":"Kendra","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"MJHS."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stige","ForeName":"Brynjulf","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bergen."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Music Ther","NlmUniqueID":"0014162","ISSNLinking":"0022-2917"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Music"},{"DescriptorName":"Music Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Family Relations"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30053091","5056495","10.1093\/jmt\/thy012"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29338323","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"23","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"04"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Psychosocial interventions for people with dementia: a synthesis of systematic reviews.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"393-403"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2017.1423031","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Over the last 10\u00a0years there has been a multitude of studies of psychosocial interventions for people with dementia. However, clinical services face a dilemma about which intervention should be introduced into clinical practice because of the inconsistency in some of the findings between different studies and the differences in the study qualities and trustworthiness of evidence. There was a need to provide a comprehensive summary of the best evidence to illustrate what works.","A review of the systematic reviews of psychosocial interventions in dementia published between January 2010 and February 2016 was conducted.","Twenty-two reviews (8 physical, 7 cognitive, 1 physical\/cognitive and 6 other psychosocial interventions) with a total of 197 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. Both medium to longer-term multi-component exercise of moderate to high intensity, and, group cognitive stimulation consistently show benefits. There is not sufficient evidence to determine whether psychological or social interventions might improve either mood or behaviour due to the heterogeneity of the studies and interventions included in the reviews.","There is good evidence that multi-component exercise with sufficient intensity improves global physical and cognitive functions and activities of daily living skills. There is also good evidence that group-based cognitive stimulation improves cognitive functions, social interaction and quality of life. This synthesis also highlights the potential importance of group activities to improve social integration for people with dementia.

music therapy with people with moderate to severe dementia, was developed from qualitative data of focus groups and interviews. Expert and peer consultations were conducted at each stage of the scale development to maximize its content validity. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of MiDAS.","Care home residents with dementia attended weekly group music therapy for up to ten sessions. Music therapists and care home staff were requested to complete weekly MiDAS ratings. The Quality of Life Scale (QoL-AD) was completed at three time-points.","A total of 629 (staff = 306, therapist = 323) MiDAS forms were completed. The statistical analysis revealed that MiDAS has high therapist inter-rater reliability, low staff inter-rater reliability, adequate staff test-retest reliability, adequate concurrent validity, and good construct validity. High factor loadings between the five MiDAS Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) items, levels of Interest, Response, Initiation, Involvement, and Enjoyment, were found.","This study indicates that MiDAS has good psychometric properties despite the small sample size. Future research with a larger sample size could provide a more in-depth psychometric evaluation, including further exploration of the underlying factors. MiDAS provides a measure of engagement with musical experience and offers insight into who is likely to benefit on other outcomes such as quality of life or reduction in psychiatric symptoms."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McDermott","ForeName":"Orii","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orgeta","ForeName":"Vasiliki","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ridder","ForeName":"Hanne Mette","Initials":"HM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Doctoral Programme in Music Therapy, Institute for Communication and Psychology, Aalborg University, Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"02","Day":"13"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Music Therapy","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Observer Variation"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24524811","S1041610214000180","10.1017\/S1041610214000180"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24410398","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"09","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"08"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2014"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"The importance of music for people with dementia: the perspectives of people with dementia, family carers, staff and music therapists.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"706-16"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2013.875124","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Despite the popularity of music-based interventions in dementia care, there is a limited knowledge of how and why people with dementia find music beneficial for their well-being. A qualitative study was conducted to develop further insights into the musical experiences of people with dementia and explore the meaning of music in their lives.","Separate focus groups and interviews with (1) care home residents with dementia and their families, (2) day hospital clients with dementia, (3) care home staff, and (4) music therapists, were conducted. The findings of the thematic analysis were investigated further in the light of psychosocial factors with the aim of developing a theoretical model on music in dementia.","Six key themes were identified. The accessibility of music for people at all stages of dementia, close links between music, personal identity and life events, the importance of relationship-building through music making were particularly highlighted as valuable. The psychosocial model of music in dementia was developed. The model revealed the importance of music to support the personal psychology of people with dementia and the social psychology of the care home environment.","The effects of music go beyond the reduction of behavioural and psychological symptoms.
