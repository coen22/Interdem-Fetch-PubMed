Despite universal recognition of the importance of ACP for people with dementia, who gradually lose their ability to make informed decisions themselves, ACP still only happens infrequently, and evidence-based recommendations on when and how to perform this complex process are lacking. We aimed to develop evidence-based clinical recommendations to guide professionals across settings in the practical application of ACP in dementia care.","Following the Belgian Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's procedures, we 1) performed an extensive literature search to identify international guidelines, articles reporting heterogeneous study designs and grey literature, 2) developed recommendations based on the available evidence and expert opinion of the author group, and 3) performed a validation process using written feedback from experts, a survey for end users (healthcare professionals across settings), and two peer-review groups (with geriatricians and general practitioners).","Based on 67 publications and validation from ten experts, 51 end users and two peer-review groups (24 participants) we developed 32 recommendations covering eight domains: initiation of ACP, evaluation of mental capacity, holding ACP conversations, the role and importance of those close to the person with dementia, ACP with people who find it difficult or impossible to communicate verbally, documentation of wishes and preferences, including information transfer, end-of-life decision-making, and preconditions for optimal implementation of ACP. Almost all recommendations received a grading representing low to very low-quality evidence.","No high-quality guidelines are available for ACP in dementia care. By combining evidence with expert and user opinions, we have defined a unique set of recommendations for ACP in people living with dementia. These recommendations form a valuable tool for educating healthcare professionals on how to perform ACP across settings."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piers","ForeName":"Ruth","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium."},{"Affiliation":"End-of-life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Ghent University, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090, Brussels, Belgium."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Albers","ForeName":"Gwenda","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Flanders Federation for Palliative Care, Vilvoorde, Belgium."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gilissen","ForeName":"Joni","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"End-of-life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Ghent University, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090, Brussels, Belgium.

Having accurate knowledge of what one experiences when living with dementia is important for developing proactive care for individuals with dementia and their families. The aim of our Grounded Theory study was to explore what it means for elderly people to live with early-stage dementia. We interviewed 20 elderly people with probable mild dementia and their family members. Living with dementia was often presented as a positive narrative, one that told of only minor problems and which stressed abilities and contentment with life. Being valued, rather than losing one's cognition or identity was central in their experience. More in-depth analyses of participants' narratives revealed, however, that they were constantly balancing their feelings of value and worthlessness, struggling to remain someone of value. This struggle was prompted by threats posed by dementia and by the persons' interactions with others. Superficially, a positive narrative may be understood as a lack of awareness or as denial due to cognitive loss. Our findings suggest, however, that we should look beyond this superficial view and seek to understand the narrative as an expression of one's attempt to counterbalance devaluation."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Steeman","ForeName":"Els","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine, Centre for Health Services and Nursing Research, Catholic University Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium. els.steeman@ugent.be"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Godderis","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grypdonck","ForeName":"Mieke","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"De Bal","ForeName":"Nele","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dierckx de Casterl\u00e9","ForeName":"Bernadette","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Narration"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"4","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"6","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"4","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17453545","773452396","10.1080\/13607860600963364"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16796664","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"01","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"06","Day":"26"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0309-2402","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"54","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Journal of advanced nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"J Adv Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Living with early-stage dementia: a review of qualitative studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"722-38"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This paper presents a literature review whose aim was to provide better understanding of living with early-stage dementia.","Even in the early stages, dementia may challenge quality of life. Research on early-stage dementia is mainly in the domain of biomedical aetiology and pathology, providing little understanding of what it means to live with dementia. Knowledge of the lived experience of having dementia is important in order to focus pro-active care towards enhancing quality of life. Qualitative research is fundamentally well suited to obtaining an insider's view of living with early-stage dementia.","We performed a meta-synthesis of qualitative research findings. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO and reviewed the papers cited in the references of pertinent articles, the references cited in a recently published book on the subjective experience of dementia, one thesis, and the journal Dementia. Thirty-three pertinent articles were identified, representing 28 separate studies and 21 different research samples. Findings were coded, grouped, compared and integrated.","Living with dementia is described from the stage a person discovers the memory impairment, through the stage of being diagnosed with dementia, to that of the person's attempts to integrate the impairment into everyday life. Memory loss often threatens perceptions of security, autonomy and being a meaningful member of society. At early stages of memory loss, individuals use self-protecting and self-adjusting strategies to deal with perceived changes and threats. However, the memory impairment itself may make it difficult for an individual to deal with these changes, thereby causing frustration, uncertainty and fear.","Our analysis supports the integration of proactive care into the diagnostic process, because even early-stage dementia may challenge quality of life. Moreover, this care should actively involve both the individual with dementia and their family so that both parties can adjust positively to living with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Steeman","ForeName":"Els","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Center for Health Services and Nursing Research, Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. els.steeman@ugent.be"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Casterl\u00e9","ForeName":"Bernadette Dierckx","Initials":"BD"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Godderis","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grypdonck","ForeName":"Mieke","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Adv Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"7609811","ISSNLinking":"0309-2402"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Emotions"},{"DescriptorName":"Fear"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["etiology","psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Personal Autonomy"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"69"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"6","Day":"27","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"1","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"6","Day":"27","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16796664","JAN3874","10.1111\/j.1365-2648.2006.03874.x"]}}}]}
