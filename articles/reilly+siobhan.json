The first phase of a COS study is to form a 'long-list' of outcomes. Key stakeholders then decide on their importance. COS reporting is described as suboptimal and this first phase is often under-reported. Our objective was to develop a 'long-list' of outcome items for non-pharmacological interventions for people with dementia living at home.","Three iterative phases were conducted. First, people living with dementia, care partners, health and social care professionals, policymakers and researchers (n\u00a0=\u200955) took part in interviews or focus groups and were asked which outcomes were important. Second, existing dementia trials were identified from the ALOIS database. 248 of 1009 pharmacological studies met the inclusion criteria. Primary and secondary outcomes were extracted from a 50% random sample (n\u00a0=\u2009124) along with eight key reviews\/qualitative papers and 38 policy documents. Third, extracted outcome items were translated onto an existing qualitative framework and mapped into domains. The research team removed areas of duplication and refined the 'long-list' in eight workshops.","One hundred seventy outcome items were extracted from the qualitative data and literature. The 170 outcome items were consolidated to 54 in four domains (Self-Managing Dementia Symptoms, Quality of Life, Friendly Neighbourhood & Home, Independence).","This paper presents a transparent blueprint for 'long-list' development. Though a useful resource in their own right, the 54 outcome items will be distilled further in a modified Delphi survey and consensus meeting to identify core outcomes."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harding","ForeName":"Andrew J

beyond the role of 'participant' to involvement in all areas of the research process. This reflects shifts in dementia studies from 'research on' to 'research with' people living with the condition. In this paper, we describe the design process and features of a modified Delphi survey devised through consultation with people living with dementia.","This article focusses on consultation with people living with dementia and care partners to design an accessible Delphi survey to facilitate participation in core outcome set development. We used the COINED model of co-research developed through the ESRC\/NIHR Neighbourhoods and Dementia Study to structure consultation on three features of modified Delphi design. Consultation was achieved through 1:1 and group sessions with a total of 28 individuals (18 people living with dementia and seven care partners).","A flexible, responsive and adaptive approach to ongoing consultation with people living with dementia and care partners through 1:1 face-to-face sessions facilitated: (1) the development of a 3-point non-categorical importance scale; (2) the translation of 54 outcome areas into 'accessible statements' for a two-round Delphi survey administered to five stakeholder groups (people living with dementia, care partners, health and social care professionals, policy-makers and researchers); and (3) the delivery of a Delphi survey. These features of core outcome set development facilitated the involvement of people living with dementia in study design and as research participants in the data collection phase.","Involvement of people living with dementia as a key stakeholder group is not reflected in studies using Delphi survey methods for core outcome set development. Time, resources, researcher expertise and support, underpinned through targeted funding facilitate meaningful and productive inclusive approaches, now an expectation of dementia research.","The study

relevant health and social care professionals, researchers and policymakers) and a review of the literature will be undertaken to build a long list of outcomes. 2 Two rounds of Delphi surveys will be used with key stakeholder groups. Statements for the Delphi surveys and participation processes will be developed and informed through substantial member involvement with people living with dementia and care partners. A consensus meeting will be convened with key participant groups to discuss the key findings and finalise the COS. 3 A systematic literature review will be undertaken to assess the properties of tools and instruments to assess components of the COS. Measurement properties, validity and reliability will be assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement (COSMIN) and COMET guidance. 4 A stated preference survey will elicit the preferences of key stakeholders for the outcomes identified as important to measure in the COS.","To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a modified Delphi process to involve people living with dementia as a participant group.

dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"CD008345"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/14651858.CD008345.pub2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Over 35 million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the world and the societal costs are very high. Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co-ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long-term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital.","To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including 'treatment as usual', standard community treatment and other non-case management interventions.","We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration\/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated.","We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co-ordination of care.","We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the I\u00b2 statistic.","We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias.The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 - 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.93 to -3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD -7.70, 95% CI -9.38 to -6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 - 6, 12, 18 - 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs).The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well-being in a single study at six months (MD -2.20 CI CI -4.14 to -0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD= -705.00, 95% CI -1170.31 to -239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services.","There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good-quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow-up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta-analysis."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Reilly","ForeName":"Siobhan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division

dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"460-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Current policy in England emphasises the importance of caring for highly dependent older people for as long as possible at home. It is therefore crucial that day care services are effective and widely available.","To compare the type and standard of care provided for older people with dementia in day centre and day hospital settings.","A cross-sectional postal survey design was employed. Representatives from three-quarters of identified specialist day care services for older people with dementia in the North West of England provided information on a range of indicators including: basic structural features; delivery of care; service content; and quality measures.","Day hospitals tended to have more day care places and a greater number of attendees, but lower occupancy rates than day centres. Day hospitals reported higher standards of care in relation to systematic assessment and care planning, promotion of rehabilitation, carer involvement and individualised provision of care. They were also more likely to employ building design features to encourage independence and choice for people with dementia. A higher proportion of day centres provided services exclusively to older people with dementia and a greater proportion of staff in day centres had undergone specific training in caring for people with dementia. Day centres were also more likely to have effective transport arrangements in place.","The standards developed for the study were sufficiently reliable to allow for an acceptable estimate of quality. Day centres and day hospitals appeared to perform two distinct, but complementary functions. These results provide key material for shaping the provision of day care for older people with dementia, especially given the absence of national standards in this area."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Reilly","ForeName":"Siobhan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal Social Services Research Unit, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. siobhan.reilly@man.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Venables","ForeName":"Dan","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hughes","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Abendstern","ForeName":"Michele","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Day Care, Medical","QualifierName":["organization & administration","standards","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"rehabilitation"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Facility Design and Construction"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Assessment","QualifierName":["methods","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services for the Aged","QualifierName":["organization & administration","standards","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitals","QualifierName":["standards","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"State Medicine","QualifierName":"standards"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"5","Day":"6","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"1","Day":"5","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"5","Day":"6","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16676291","10.1002\/gps.1495"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16323254","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"08","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Levels of integration and specialisation within professional community teams for people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"77-85"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Delivering integrated and specialist mental health services for the growing population of older people with dementia in Britain is a key concern of the present government.","To consider the nature of current practice among multi-disciplinary and single discipline health and social care teams providing a service to people with dementia and compare the quality of service offered.","A postal survey of professional community teams in North West England, providing services to people with dementia.
