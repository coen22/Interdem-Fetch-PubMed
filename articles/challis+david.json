Commissioners of services for older adults were invited to complete a questionnaire. An exploratory cluster analysis of nominal data was conducted using a TwoStep procedure to identify distinct groups.","A total of 122 authorities (83%) responded to the request. Four approaches to commissioning were identified, reflecting commissioning practices at the organisational, strategic, and individual service user levels. Commissioning at the service user level was most apparent. Bivariate analysis found that these configurations were not associated with the types of dementia specific services provided but were related to the number available. Authorities delivered a greater range of specialist services when joint commissioning between social care and health partners was undertaken. However, the joint commissioning of services was less observed in services specifically for people with dementia than in generic services for all older people. There was limited evidence that local circumstances (population configuration and deprivation levels) were associated with this approach to commissioning.","The significant role of health partners in the delivery of social care services to support older people living with dementia in their own homes is evident. As the population with dementia ages and physical health needs increase, how dementia specific services differ from and complement those services available to all older people warrants further investigation."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Sue","Initials":"S","Identifier":"0000-0002-7818-3228","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The University of Manchester, Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU), Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hughes","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0001-5568-9659","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Nottingham Innovation Park, Institute of Mental Health, Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ahmed","ForeName":"Saima","Initials":"S","Identifier":"0000-0002-6206-3184","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The University of Manchester, Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU), Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clarkson","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P","Identifier":"0000-0002-0778-312X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The University of Manchester, Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU), Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D","Identifier":"0000-0002-6464-2286","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Nottingham Innovation Park, Institute of Mental Health, Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"Members of the HoSt-D (Home Support in Dementia) Programme Management Group"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"DTC-RP-PG-0311-12003","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"10"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Care Surveys"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Independent Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Work","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["adult social care","commissioning","dementia","home care","survey"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"12"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"15"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"11","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31631399","10.1002\/gps.5214"]},"ReferenceList":{"Title":"REFERENCES","Reference":[{"Citation":"Prince M, Wimo A, Guerchet M, Ali GC, Wu YT, Prina M.

This paper explores the potential of using a novel approach to embedded qualitative design as part of an observational study examining the effectiveness of home support for people in later stage dementia in England. The method involved collecting and analysing unsolicited conversational comments made by participants as they completed standardised measures. An evaluation of the method is presented using the voices of participants to illustrate its potential.","The conversations of 17 carers recruited to an observational study were audio recorded to gather commentary made while completing a structured interview. Data were interrogated using thematic analysis to investigate the feasibility of conducting an embedded qualitative study, the potential richness of the material and participants' reactions to formal questioning and participating in research.","The findings revealed that qualitative data were available from this approach. Analysis generated three themes from carers: conflicting carer emotions; the importance of maintaining normality and agency within day-to-day life; and tensions between these desires and making use of formal services. Important issues for carers were revealed establishing the benefit of using the method. The advantages of exploiting unsolicited conversation included enhancing understanding of people's lived experience, reducing participant burden in research and easing the process of data collection. In addition, it provided an opportunity to evaluate individuals' experience of the research process.","The findings demonstrate how unsolicited comments during structured interviews may appear incidental but can reveal important aspects of living with dementia. The method also emphasised methodological challenges for research in dementia, including the influence and impact of the research context. Further research is required to evaluate the method with other groups including people with dementia themselves."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Abendstern","ForeName":"Michele","Initials":"M","Identifier":"0000-0002-8672-7387","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal

outcome sets (COS) prioritise outcomes based on their importance to key stakeholders, reduce reporting bias and increase comparability across studies. The first phase of a COS study is to form a 'long-list' of outcomes. Key stakeholders then decide on their importance. COS reporting is described as suboptimal and this first phase is often under-reported. Our objective was to develop a 'long-list' of outcome items for non-pharmacological interventions for people with dementia living at home.","Three iterative phases were conducted. First, people living with dementia, care partners, health and social care professionals, policymakers and researchers (n\u00a0=\u200955) took part in interviews or focus groups and were asked which outcomes were important. Second, existing dementia trials were identified from the ALOIS database. 248 of 1009 pharmacological studies met the inclusion criteria. Primary and secondary outcomes were extracted from a 50% random sample (n\u00a0=\u2009124) along with eight key reviews\/qualitative papers and 38 policy documents. Third, extracted outcome items were translated onto an existing qualitative framework and mapped into domains. The research team removed areas of duplication and refined the 'long-list' in eight workshops.","One hundred seventy outcome items were extracted from the qualitative data and literature. The 170 outcome items were consolidated to 54 in four domains (Self-Managing Dementia Symptoms, Quality of Life, Friendly Neighbourhood & Home, Independence).","This paper presents a transparent blueprint for 'long-list' development. Though a useful resource in their own right, the 54 outcome items will be distilled further in a modified Delphi survey and consensus meeting to identify core outcomes."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harding","ForeName":"Andrew J

dementia and their carers following diagnosis but research on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different approaches is sparse. The Dementia Early Stage Cognitive Aids New Trial (DESCANT) will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of memory aids, training and support to people with mild to moderate dementia and their carers at home and compares that intervention with treatment as usual.","This is a multi-site, pragmatic randomised trial preceded by a feasibility study and internal pilot. We aim to allocate at random 360 pairs comprising a person with mild to moderate dementia and an identified carer between the DESCANT intervention and treatment as usual. We assess participants at baseline, 13 and 26\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome measure is the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale; other participant outcomes include cognition, quality of life, activities of daily living and social networking; carer outcomes include quality of life, sense of competence and mental health. To enhance this quantitative evaluation we are conducting a qualitative component and a process evaluation to assess the implementation process and identify contextual factors associated with variation.","The DESCANT intervention reflects current policy to enhance the capabilities of people with dementia after diagnosis and their carers. If it is clinically and cost-effective, its modest nature and cost will enhance the likelihood of it being incorporated into mainstream practice.","Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN12591717 .

person-centredness in older people's long-term community care are hindered by the lack of appropriate measures. Studies have tended to rely on proxy indicators or generic instruments, risking invalid results. This new research aimed to develop and psychometrically test a person-centredness scale for use in older people's community services.","Questionnaire items were sourced from groups of older people and mapped to a conceptual framework of person-centredness. A postal questionnaire in 2015-2016 tested these items with older people supported by mental health and social care services in five areas of England. Dimensionality was assessed through exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory bifactor model, with classical item analysis removing weak items. Test-retest analysis was undertaken through a repeated postal questionnaire 3\u00a0weeks after the first.","Three factors were identified, representing (i) interpersonal and (ii) organisational aspects of person-centred care; and (iii) negatively phrased items. Removing weaker items resulted in an 18-item scale. The bifactor analysis concluded the summary scale was 'essentially unidimensional'. The Person-centred community care inventory (PERCCI) had excellent reliability, with Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient of 0.886 [95% CI 0.818-0.929]. A priori hypotheses about associations with satisfaction metrics and support variables were broadly confirmed.","The PERCCI has promising measurement properties and can be recommended for use in research with older adults using community mental health and social care services.

outcome set (COS) for use when evaluating non-pharmacological health and social care interventions for people living at home with dementia.","Drawing on the guidance and approaches of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET), this study uses a four-phase mixed-methods design: 1 Focus groups and interviews with key stakeholder groups (people living with dementia, care partners, relevant health and social care professionals, researchers and policymakers) and a review of the literature will be undertaken to build a long list of outcomes. 2 Two rounds of Delphi surveys will be used with key stakeholder groups. Statements for the Delphi surveys and participation processes will be developed and informed through substantial member involvement with people living with dementia and care partners. A consensus meeting will be convened with key participant groups to discuss the key findings and finalise the COS. 3 A systematic literature review will be undertaken to assess the properties of tools and instruments to assess components of the COS. Measurement properties, validity and reliability will be assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement (COSMIN) and COMET guidance. 4 A stated preference survey will elicit the preferences of key stakeholders for the outcomes identified as important to measure in the COS.","To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a modified Delphi process to involve people living with dementia as a participant group. Though the study is confined to collecting data in the United Kingdom, use of the COS by researchers will enhance the comparability of studies evaluating non-pharmacological and community-based interventions.","The study is registered on the COMET initiative, registered in 2014 at comet-initiative.org

RightTimePlaceCare cohort.","HC and ILTC settings from 8 European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and England).","A total of 1997 PwD (1217 in HC group and 780 lived in an ILTC) and their caregivers.","Medical care, community care, and informal care were recorded using the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) questionnaire. Agitation was assessed based on the agitation symptoms cluster defined by the presence of agitation and\/or irritability and\/or disinhibition and\/or aberrant motor behavior items of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q).","Total monthly mean cost differences due to agitation were 445\u20ac in the HC setting and 561\u20ac in the ILTC setting (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01 and .02, respectively). Informal care costs were the main driver in the HC group (73% of total costs) and institutional care costs were the main driver in the ILTC group (53% of total costs). After adjustments, the log link generalized linear mixed model showed an association between agitation symptoms and an increase of informal care costs by 17% per month in HC setting (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05).","This study found that agitation symptoms have a substantial impact on informal care costs in the community care setting. Future research is needed to evaluate which strategies may be efficient by improving the cost-effectiveness ratio and reducing the burden associated with informal care in the management of agitation in PwD."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

mental health services or those for people with dementia. This study aimed to explore in detail the perceptions of dementia (symptoms, causes, consequences, treatments) held by South Asians and to discern how these understandings vary by age and by the self-recognition of memory problems, as these influence help-seeking behaviour.","Participants were allocated to three groups: younger adults; older adults; and older adults with subjective memory problems. They completed the semi-structured Barts Explanatory Model Inventory for Dementia schedule, whilst older adults also completed measures of cognition (MMSE), and depression (GDS). Interviews were conducted in English, Gujarati or Urdu.","Groups were similar in identifying unusual forgetting and confusion as the most frequent symptoms; stress and age as the most frequent causes; and talking to your GP\/nurse, taking medication, and talking to family and friends as the most frequent treatments. Younger adults more often knew about risk factors and reported practical consequences more than older adults. Older adults with subjective memory problems were more likely to describe sleep related problems or symptoms commonly associated with depression. They more often cited as causes of dementia lack of sleep, side effects of medication and medical reasons, and mentioned religion as a means to cope.","Findings highlight variability in perceptions of dementia across the South Asian Community and identify specific areas where dementia awareness could be raised in South Asian sub-groups to improve timely diagnosis, treatment outcomes and service

Findings were similar regardless of the method of administration, with respite care considered to be the most important attribute for all carers. Carers reported that completing the DCE had been a positive experience; however, feedback was mixed overall.","These carer preferences concur with emerging evidence on home support interventions for dementia.

signals the need for effective forms of home support to people with dementia and their carers. The cost-effectiveness evidence of different approaches to support is scant.","To appraise economic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of home support interventions for dementia to inform future evaluation.","A systematic literature review of full and partial economic evaluations was performed using the British National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database supplemented by additional references. Study characteristics and findings, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, when available, were summarized narratively. Study quality was appraised using the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database critical appraisal criteria and independent ratings, agreed by two reviewers. Studies were located on a permutation matrix describing their mix of incremental costs\/effects to aid decision making.","Of the 151 articles retrieved, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria: 8 concerning support to people with dementia and 6 to carers. Five studies were incremental cost-utility analyses, seven were cost-effectiveness analyses, and two were cost consequences analyses. Five studies expressed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (\u00a36,696-\u00a3207,942 per quality-adjusted life-year). In four studies, interventions were dominant over usual care. Two interventions were more costly but more beneficial and were favorable against current acceptability thresholds.","Occupational therapy, home-based exercise, and a carers' coping intervention emerged as cost-effective approaches for which there was better evidence. These interventions used environmental modifications, behavior management, physical activity, and emotional support as active components. More robust evidence is needed to judge the value of these and other interventions across the dementia care pathway."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

Variables relating to the person with dementia included cognitive functioning (S-MMSE), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q), depressive symptoms (Cornell depression scale), comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and physical functioning (Katz Activity of Daily Living [ADL] Index). The care support network was measured using hours of caregiving (ADLs, instrumental ADLs [IADLs], supervision), additional informal care support, and service receipt (home care, day care). Experience of carer burden was recorded using the Zarit Burden Interview. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with high carer burden.","Carer burden was highest in Estonia (mean 39.7\/88) and lowest in the Netherlands (mean 26.5\/88). High burden was significantly associated with characteristics of the informal carer (family relationship, specifically wives or daughters), of the person with dementia (physical dependency in ADLs; neuropsychiatric symptoms, in particular nighttime behaviors and irritability), the care support network (hours of caregiving supervision; receipt of other informal care support) and country of residence.","A range of factors are associated with burden in informal carers of people with dementia judged to be on the margins of LTC. Support for informal carers needs to take account of gender differences. The dual challenges of distressed behaviors and difficulties in ADLs by the person with dementia may be addressed by specific nonpharmacological interventions focusing on both elements. The potential protective effect of additional informal support to carers highlights the importance of peer support or better targeted home support services. The implementation of appropriate and tailored interventions to reduce burden by supporting informal carers may enable people with dementia to remain at home for longer."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

dementia. There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)].

between September 2013 - April 2014.","Systematic reviews were appraised against Cochrane Collaboration levels of effectiveness. Components of psychosocial interventions were identified with their theoretical rationale. Findings were explored with a Patient, Public and Carer Involvement group.","Thirty-six systematic reviews were included. From interventions, 14 components were identified, nine for people with dementia and five for carers, mostly undertaken in nursing\/care homes. For people with dementia, there was evidence of effectiveness for cognitive stimulation and cognitive training, but less evidence for sensory stimulation, reminiscence, staff education, behavioural therapy and ADL training. For carers, there was evidence of effectiveness for education and training, psychotherapy and counselling.","There was a lack of definitive evidence of effectiveness for most psychosocial interventions. Further studies with stronger methodology or replication of existing studies would strengthen the evidence base.

However, home support is frequently not tailored to the individual needs of people with dementia. Staff allocating home support services may not identify important care needs, which only be recognised by informal carers. The purpose of this study was to explore the balance of informal and formal home support and their associated costs from the perspectives of both informal carers and paid staff. Five case vignettes of people with dementia were designed based on an existing English data set from a European study into transition into long-term care (the RightTimePlaceCare programme), representing 42 per cent of the English sample. In total, 14 informal carers and 14 paid staff were consulted in separate groups, as expert panels, regarding their recommendations for home care services for each vignette. Care recommendations of carers and staff were costed based on nationally available unit costs and compared. Informal carers allocated fewer hours of care than staff. Personal and domestic home care and day care centres were the most frequently recommended formal services by both groups, and some vignettes of people with dementia were recommended for care home admission. The ratio of costs of informal versus formal support was relatively equal for paid staff, yet unbalanced from the perspectives of informal carers with a greater proportion of formal care costs.

However, in the mild stages, people with dementia (PwD) are still able to initiate and perform many of those tasks. With a lack of research exploring variations between different dementia diagnoses, this study sought to investigate those daily activities with modest impairments in the mild stages and how these compare between Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed dementia.","Staff from memory assessment services from nine National Health Service trusts across England identified and approached informal carers of people with mild dementia. Carers completed the newly revised Interview for Deteriorations in Daily Living Activities in Dementia 2 assessing the PwD's initiative and performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Data were analysed using analysis of variance and Chi-square tests to compare the maintenance of IADL functioning across AD, VaD, and mixed dementia.","A total of 160 carers returned the Interview for Deteriorations in Daily Living Activities in Dementia 2, of which 109, 21, and 30 cared for someone with AD, VaD, and mixed dementia, respectively. There were significant variations across subtypes, with AD showing better preserved initiative and performance than VaD for several IADLs. Overall, PwD showed greater preservation of performance than initiative, with tasks such as preparing a hot drink and dressing being best maintained.","Findings can help classify dementia better into subtypes in order to receive bespoke support. It suggests that interventions should primarily address initiative to improve overall functioning.

The current trial aims to evaluate the United Kingdom-adapted occupational therapy intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia and their family carers living in the community (COTiD-UK) compared with treatment as usual.","This study is a multi-centre, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised trial with internal pilot. We aim to allocate 480 pairs, with each pair comprising a person with mild to moderate dementia and a family carer, who provides at least 4 hours of practical support per week, at random between COTiD-UK and treatment as usual. We shall assess participants at baseline, 12 and 26 weeks, and by telephone at 52 and 78 weeks (first 40% of recruits only) after randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) at 26 weeks. Secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, mood, and resource use. To assess intervention delivery, and client experience, we shall collect qualitative data via audio recordings of COTiD-UK sessions and conduct semi-structured interviews with pairs and occupational therapists.","COTiD-UK is an evidence-based person-centred intervention that reflects the current priority to enable people with dementia to remain in their own homes by improving their capabilities whilst reducing carer burden.

from home care to long-term care (LTC) facility in people with dementia (PwD) at the margins of LTC. The aim of this study was to explore the factors associated with depressive symptomatology in PwD in different settings.","A total of 1,538 PwD, of which 957 received home care and 581 lived in a LTC facility, and their carers were interviewed. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) measured depressive symptomatology. PwD completed measures of cognition and quality of life (QoL), and informal or formal carers completed measures on the PwD' QoL, neuropsychiatric behavior, activities of daily living, comorbidities, pain, and falls. Logistic regression was used to assess which factors contributed to depressive symptomatology in the two settings.","Those receiving home care, living in Germany, and with severe dementia, showed the highest prevalence of depressive symptomatology. In the home care group, high levels of pain, neuropsychiatric behavior, and comorbidity, as well as low self- and proxy-rated QoL were factors associated with depressive symptomatology. In the LTC group, low proxy-rated QoL, more severe neuropsychiatric behavior, being a male informal carer and living in Germany were associated with depressive symptomatology.","Evidence highlights the need for targeting different aspects in the management of depression in dementia, including offering improved pain management for those living in the community. Further research needs to explore cultural variations and carer gender factors associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Giebel","ForeName":"Clarissa","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal Social Services Research Unit,The University of Manchester,Manchester,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sutcliffe","ForeName":"Caroline","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal Social Services Research Unit,The University of Manchester,Manchester,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verbeek","ForeName":"Hilde","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research,Maastricht University,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zabalegui","ForeName":"Adelaida","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Hospital Clinic of Barcelona,Nursing,Barcelona,Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soto","ForeName":"Maria","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatric Medicine,Gerontopole,INSERM 1027,University Hospital de Toulouse,Toulouse,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hallberg","ForeName":"Ingalill Rahm","Initials":"IR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Sciences,Lund University,Lund,Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Saks","ForeName":"Kai","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Internal Medicine,University of Tartu,Tartu,Estonia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Renom-Guiteras","ForeName":"Anna","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing Science,Faculty of Health,University of Witten\/Herdecke,Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Suhonen","ForeName":"Riitta","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing Science,University of Turku,Turku,Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal Social Services Research Unit,The University of Manchester,Manchester,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Comorbidity"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":["epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Europe","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Care Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Prevalence"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","depression","home care","long-term care","neuropsychiatric behavior","pain"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26652662","S1041610215002100","10.1017\/S1041610215002100"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26489696","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"01","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"31","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Identifying the causes, prevention and management of crises in dementia.

Findings are evaluated with respect to the relationship between cognitive and functional impairments.","From the literature searches, 17 studies on everyday functioning and 40 studies on memory were obtained. Studies were only included if patients had an official diagnosis and were in the early stages of dementia.","Complex instrumental activities of daily living were subject to greater impairment than basic activities of daily living. In particular, early dementia patients struggle with finance tasks; a deficit linked to impaired working memory. Regarding cognition, long-term memory is the earliest form of memory to decline as is well recognised. Evidence also indicates deficits in working and prospective memory, with inconsistent evidence about impairments of the former. A major limitation of the literature is a lack of studies assessing individual everyday activities and the associated error patterns that might occur.","This review critically assesses the status of translational research for everyday activities in early dementia, an area with critical implications for cognitive-based rehabilitation.

Case management is a widely used and strongly promoted complex intervention for organising and co-ordinating care at the level of the individual, with the aim of providing long-term care for people with dementia in the community as an alternative to early admission to a care home or hospital.","To evaluate the effectiveness of case management approaches to home support for people with dementia, from the perspective of the different people involved (patients, carers, and staff) compared with other forms of treatment, including 'treatment as usual', standard community treatment and other non-case management interventions.","We searched the following databases up to 31 December 2013: ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group,The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science (including Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Science Citation Index), Campbell Collaboration\/SORO database and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. We updated this search in March 2014 but results have not yet been incorporated.","We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of case management interventions for people with dementia living in the community and their carers. We screened interventions to ensure that they focused on planning and co-ordination of care.","We used standard methodological procedures as required by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently extracted data and made 'Risk of bias' assessments using Cochrane criteria. For continuous outcomes, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups along with its confidence interval (95% CI). We applied a fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. For binary or dichotomous data, we generated the corresponding odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. We assessed heterogeneity by the I\u00b2 statistic.","We include 13 RCTs involving 9615 participants with dementia in the review. Case management interventions in studies varied. We found low to moderate overall risk of bias; 69% of studies were at high risk for performance bias.The case management group were significantly less likely to be institutionalised (admissions to residential or nursing homes) at six months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98, n = 5741, 6 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.02) and at 18 months (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.61, n = 363, 4 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.003). However, the effects at 10 - 12 months (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08, n = 5990, 9 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 48%, P = 0.39) and 24 months (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.03, n = 201, 2 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.94) were uncertain. There was evidence from one trial of a reduction in the number of days per month in a residential home or hospital unit in the case management group at six months (MD -5.80, 95% CI -7.93 to -3.67, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001) and at 12 months (MD -7.70, 95% CI -9.38 to -6.02, n = 88, 1 RCT, P < 0.0001). One trial reported the length of time until participants were institutionalised at 12 months and the effects were uncertain (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.14, P = 0.14). There was no difference in the number of people admitted to hospital at six (4 RCTs, 439 participants), 12 (5 RCTs, 585 participants) and 18 months (5 RCTs, 613 participants). For mortality at 4 - 6, 12, 18 - 24 and 36 months, and for participants' or carers' quality of life at 4, 6, 12 and 18 months, there were no significant effects. There was some evidence of benefits in carer burden at six months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01, n = 4601, 4 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 26%, P = 0.03) but the effects at 12 or 18 months were uncertain. Additionally, some evidence indicated case management was more effective at reducing behaviour disturbance at 18 months (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.07, n = 206, 2 RCTs I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.01) but effects were uncertain at four (2 RCTs), six (4 RCTs) or 12 months (5 RCTs).The case management group showed a small significant improvement in carer depression at 18 months (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.01, n = 2888, 3 RCTs, I\u00b2 = 0%, P = 0.03). Conversely, the case management group showed greater improvement in carer well-being in a single study at six months (MD -2.20 CI CI -4.14 to -0.26, n = 65, 1 RCT, P = 0.03) but the effects were uncertain at 12 or 18 months. There was some evidence that case management reduced the total cost of services at 12 months (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.02, n = 5276, 2 RCTs, P = 0.01) and incurred lower dollar expenditure for the total three years (MD= -705.00, 95% CI -1170.31 to -239.69, n = 5170, 1 RCT, P = 0.003). Data on a number of outcomes consistently indicated that the intervention group received significantly more community services.","There is some evidence that case management is beneficial at improving some outcomes at certain time points, both in the person with dementia and in their carer. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the interventions, outcomes measured and time points across the 13 included RCTs. There was some evidence from good-quality studies to suggest that admissions to care homes and overall healthcare costs are reduced in the medium term; however, the results at longer points of follow-up were uncertain. There was not enough evidence to clearly assess whether case management could delay institutionalisation in care homes. There were uncertain results in patient depression, functional abilities and cognition. Further work should be undertaken to investigate what components of case management are associated with improvement in outcomes. Increased consistency in measures of outcome would support future meta-analysis."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Reilly","ForeName":"Siobhan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division

is a public health priority. South Asian older adults experience difficulties in accessing services for memory impairment, dementia and mental illness. This review examines barriers and facilitators in the pathway to culturally appropriate mental health care.","Web of Knowledge, Pubmed and Ovid databases were searched for literature on South Asian older adults or their family carers, their understandings of mental illness and dementia and their pattern of service use. Dates were from 1984 to 2012. Abstracts were assessed for relevance, followed by detailed reading of salient papers. Three researchers rated the quality of each included study. A narrative synthesis was undertaken of extracted and charted data.","Eighteen studies met the eligibility criteria for the review.

deteriorates early in dementia and affects people with dementia and their carers.

This study therefore investigated instrumental activities of daily living deficits in mild dementia by exploring the relationship between instrumental activities of daily living initiative and performance and general cognition, people with dementia quality of life and carer stress. Moreover, this study explored the contribution of social instrumental activities of daily livings, which to date have received little or no attention.","Twenty carers were administered a revised Interview for Deterioration for Daily Living Activities in Dementia and measures of carer stress (General Health Questionnaire-12) and quality of life in dementia (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease). The people with dementia completed measures of general cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Data were analysed using frequency and bivariate correlation analyses and basic thematic analysis was employed to the qualitative data on carer stress.","Carer interviews showed that instrumental activities of daily living impairments were associated more with performance than with initiative deficits. Increased social isolation and reluctance to engage in hobbies were particularly stressful to carers and impacted negatively on the people with dementia quality of life, yet were not reported as critical in the qualitative assessment.","This study shows that people with mild dementia are impaired to different degrees on their initiative and performance of instrumental activities of daily livings and that impairments relating to social activities particularly relate to well-being.

Respondents identified problems with information sharing and incompatible electronic systems; inflexibility in home care services; and poor recognition of dementia in hospital settings. General practitioners had developed a greater awareness of the disease and some community services worked well. They felt that budgetary constraints and a focus on quality indicators impeded good dementia care. Key areas suggested by staff for improvements in dementia care included the implementation of more flexible services, dementia training for health and social care staff, and better quality care in acute hospital settings.

With increasing functional and cognitive decline, it is likely that many people suffering from dementia will receive institutional care in their lifetime. To delay entry to institutional care, many European countries invest in home and community based care services.","This study aimed to compare costs for people with dementia (PwD) at risk for institutionalization receiving professional home care (HC) with cost for PwD recently admitted to institutional long-term nursing care (ILTC) in eight European countries. Special emphasis was placed on differences in cost patterns across settings and countries, on the main predictors of costs and on a comprehensive assessment of costs from a societal perspective.","Interviews using structured questionnaires were conducted with 2,014 people with dementia and their primary informal caregivers living at home or in an ILTC facility. Costs of care were assessed with the resource utilization in dementia instrument. Dementia severity was measured with the standardized mini mental state examination. ADL dependence was assessed using the Katz index, neuropsychiatric symptoms using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and comorbidities using the Charlson. Descriptive analysis and multivariate regression models were used to estimate mean costs in both settings. A log link generalized linear model assuming gamma distributed costs was applied to identify the most important cost drivers of dementia care.","In all countries costs for PwD in the HC setting were significantly lower in comparison to ILTC costs. On average ILTC costs amounted to 4,491 Euro per month and were 1.8 fold higher than HC costs (2,491 Euro). The relation of costs between settings ranged from 2.4 (Sweden) to 1.4 (UK). Costs in the ILTC setting were dominated by nursing home costs (on average 94%). In the HC setting, informal care giving was the most important cost contributor (on average 52%). In all countries costs in the HC setting increased strongly with disease severity. The most important predictor of cost was ADL independence in all countries, except Spain and France where NPI severity was the most important cost driver. A standard deviation increase in ADL independence translated on average into a cost decrease of about 22%.","Transition into ILTC seems to increase total costs of dementia care from a societal perspective. The prevention of long-term care placement might be cost reducing for European health systems. However, this conclusion depends on the country, on the valuation method for informal caregiving and on the degree of impairment."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"W\u00fcbker","ForeName":"Ansgar","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University

Information is highly warranted on whether informal caregivers are capable of prior identification of causes of admission and, can thus be considered a reliable prospective source on causes of admission.","A cohort study among informal caregivers of people with dementia who made a transition to institutional long-term care.","Qualitative data on the expected and actual reasons for admission were collected via open-ended questions at baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, at baseline, data were collected using measurement instruments to measure pre-admission characteristics. Interviews took place between November 2010-April 2012. After categorizing the answers, the agreement between the expected and actual reasons was calculated. Furthermore, bivariate associations were calculated between the actual reasons for admission and scores on corresponding measurement instruments.","For most informal caregivers, there was agreement between their statements on the expected reason and the actual reason for admission. A third of the caregivers showed no conformity. Bivariate associations showed that there is also agreement between the actual reasons for admission and scores on corresponding measurement instruments.","Informal caregivers can be considered reliable sources of information regarding what causes the admission of a person with dementia.

However, few studies have translated findings from both areas of functioning into effective cognitive rehabilitation. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate the existing literature on the type and success of interventions and on their extent of use of cognitive theory. Given the limited evidence base in this population, further insights were obtained from studies on mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which involves fewer cognitive and everyday functioning problems than dementia.","From the literature searches, 11 studies on mild dementia and three studies on MCI were obtained. Studies were only included if the interventions either targeted instrumental activities of daily living or activities of daily living directly or as an outcome measure or if the interventions focused on real-life aspects not captured in the standardised daily activities. For inclusion, patients needed a diagnosis of dementia or MCI, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores had to be above 17 for mild dementia.","The majority of interventions indicated improved everyday activity performance in early dementia and MCI. Focusing on individual, as opposed to global, daily activities appeared to be an important determinant of intervention success in mild dementia but not in MCI. However, few attempts had been made to develop interventions grounded in evidence-based models.","This review highlights the need for further translation of the understanding of cognitive and everyday activity deficits into successful interventions for daily activities in MCI and early dementia.

Three focus groups comprising carers and people with dementia (n\u2009=\u200927) were undertaken covering topics related to experiences, service receipt, information sharing and service development. Some participants experienced difficulties or delays in receiving a dementia diagnosis and in accessing appropriate care. The provision of training, timeliness of information, access to appropriate advice, and consistent and flexible services were deemed important. The findings suggest that some issues raised by participants were highlighted in earlier policy objectives and recommendations but remain of central concern.

Future studies need to pay more attention to process measures such as implementation and fidelity strategies, and outcome measures that better capture the focus of the intervention such as level of engagement and activity."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wenborn","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"UCL Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London, London, UK; Dementia Research Centre, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Head","ForeName":"Jenny","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Miranda-Castillo","ForeName":"Claudia","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Popham","ForeName":"Carolyn","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thakur","ForeName":"Ruchi","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Illes","ForeName":"Jacqueline","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN67952488"}}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2013","Month":"05","Day":"02"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Cluster Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Occupational Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["activity","care homes","dementia","occupational therapy","older people"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2012","Month":"05","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2013","Month":"02","Day":"06"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23637069","10.1002\/gps.3960"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22269343","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"06","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"08"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2458","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Jan","Day":"23"}},"Title":"BMC public health","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Public Health"},"ArticleTitle":"A European study investigating patterns of transition from home care towards institutional dementia care: the protocol of a RightTimePlaceCare study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"68"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-68","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Health care policies in many countries aim to enable people with dementia to live in their own homes as long as possible. However, at some point during the disease the needs of a significant number of people with dementia cannot be appropriately met at home and institutional care is required. Evidence as to best practice strategies enabling people with dementia to live at home as long as possible and also identifying the right time to trigger admission to a long-term nursing care facility is therefore urgently required. The current paper presents the rationale and methods of a study generating primary data for best-practice development in the transition from home towards institutional nursing care for people with dementia and their informal caregivers. The study has two main objectives: 1) investigate country-specific factors influencing institutionalization and 2) investigate the circumstances of people with dementia and their informal caregivers in eight European countries. Additionally, data for economic evaluation purposes are being collected.","This paper describes a prospective study, conducted in eight European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, United Kingdom). A baseline assessment and follow-up measurement after 3 months will be performed. Two groups of people with dementia and their informal caregivers will be included: 1) newly admitted to institutional long-term nursing care facilities; and 2) receiving professional long-term home care, and being at risk for institutionalization. Data will be collected on outcomes for people with dementia (e.g. quality of life, quality of care), informal caregivers (e.g. caregiver burden, quality of life) and costs (e.g. resource utilization). Statistical analyses consist of descriptive and multivariate regression techniques and cross-country comparisons.","The current study, which is part of a large European project 'RightTimePlaceCare', generates primary data on outcomes and costs of long-term nursing care for people with dementia and their informal caregivers, specifically focusing on the transition from home towards institutional care. Together with data collected in three other work packages, knowledge gathered in this study will be used to inform and empower patients, professionals, policy and related decision makers to manage and improve health and social dementia care services."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verbeek","ForeName":"Hilde","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

dementia. There is a need to understand if measures are sensitive to change and what factors are associated with change in QoL in dementia to develop interventions to improve QoL and identify who may be most likely to benefit. This study aimed to assess change in QoL in people living in 24-hour care homes using the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale and investigated which clinical factors predicted changes in QoL in dementia. We used the QOL-AD scale to rate individual and staff perceptions of residents' QoL, for 238 people with dementia, recruited from 24 care homes in the United Kingdom. A follow-up interview was undertaken at 20 weeks. One hundred ninety-two (80.7%) of the 238 residents interviewed at baseline were followed up. A reduction in residents' QoL was predicted by lower baseline depression and anxiety symptoms, higher baseline QoL ratings, and an increase in depressive symptoms and cognitive deterioration at follow-up. Although QoL does not necessarily diminish as dementia progresses, it is strongly influenced by the person with dementia's mood. Improvement in cognition and mood may lead to increased QoL."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hoe","ForeName":"Juanita","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

The views of the person with dementia were commonly in agreement with the staff and family carers' views.

However, as dementia affects the ability to engage in activity, care-givers can find it difficult to provide appropriate activities. The Pool Activity Level (PAL) Checklist guides the selection of appropriate, personally meaningful activities. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the PAL Checklist when used with older people with dementia. A postal questionnaire sent to activity providers assessed content validity. Validity and reliability were measured in a sample of 60 older people with dementia. The questionnaire response rate was 83% (102\/122). Most respondents felt no important items were missing. Seven of the nine activities were ranked as 'very important' or 'essential' by at least 77% of the sample, indicating very good content validity. Correlation with measures of cognition, severity of dementia and activity performance demonstrated strong concurrent validity. Inter-item correlation indicated strong construct validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient measured internal consistency as excellent (0.95). All items achieved acceptable test-retest reliability, and the majority demonstrated acceptable inter-rater reliability. We conclude that the PAL Checklist demonstrates adequate validity and reliability when used with older people with dementia and appears a useful tool for a variety of care settings."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wenborn","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Mental Health Sciences, University College London, UK. j.wenborn@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pool","ForeName":"Jackie","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burgess","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elliott","ForeName":"Nicola","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Validation Study"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","epidemiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Motor Activity"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Swimming Pools","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"4","Day":"5","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"6","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"4","Day":"5","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18389400","791904715","10.1080\/13607860801984375"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17504909","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"10","Day":"15"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1064-7481","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Depressed mood, cognitive impairment, and survival in older people admitted to care homes in England.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"708-15"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To investigate psychiatric morbidity, cognitive impairment, dependency, and survival in residents newly admitted to care homes.","A total of 308 older people were assessed using measures of cognitive impairment and depressive symptomatology, and interviewable residents completed a quality-of-life interview.
