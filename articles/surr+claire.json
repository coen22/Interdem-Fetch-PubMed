Construct validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness were assessed using correlation, Bland-Altman plots, and panel data regression models.","Self-completed EQ-5D-5L failed to reflect clinically important differences and changes in FAST, CDR, and CMAI but did capture the resident's own view of HRQOL (QOL-AD-NH). As dementia severity increased, collection of EQ-5D-5L-proxy and DEMQOL-Proxy-U data was more feasible than collection of self-completed EQ-5D-5L. These formal-carer and informal-carer proxy measures also better reflected changes in FAST, CDR, and CMAI but did not capture the resident's own view of HRQOL (QOL-AD-NH), despite adequately capturing the proxy's own view of the resident's HRQOL (QUALID). This indicates discrepancies between a proxy's view and resident's view of the impact that tangible declines in health, cognition, or functional abilities have on HRQOL. The EQ-5D-5L-proxy and DEMQOL-Proxy-U were generally poor substitutes. Regardless of which proxy completed it, the EQ-5D-5L-proxy was typically more responsive than the DEMQOL-Proxy-U to changes in CDR, FAST, and CMAI, indicating that use of the DEMQOL-Proxy-U is not always justified.","Disparities in the measurement properties of different utility measures mean that choices about how to measure utility in trials could affect economic evaluation outcomes and hence how resources are allocated for dementia care."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 ISPOR\u2013The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

This paper addresses this gap.","Multi-methods study within a process evaluation of a cluster randomised controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 (DCM).

Expert support was vital for successful DCM implementation, although the five-days provided was felt to be insufficient. Some homes felt the support was inflexible and did not consider their individual needs. Practical challenges of experts being located at a geographical distance from the care homes, limited when and how support was available. Experts gained knowledge they were able to then apply in delivering DCM training. Experts were not able to accurately predict which homes would be able to implement DCM independently in future cycles.","An external expert may form a key component of successful implementation of psychosocial interventions in care home settings.

This means the primary care workforce needs appropriate education to ensure they have the right knowledge, skills and attitudes to meet these care needs. However, little is understood about the most successful approaches to dementia education in this setting.","An in-depth case study was undertaken in a single primary care organisation with the aim of exploring the impact of a person-centred dementia educational programme, and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. Data was gathered from a wide range of sources and analysed using Kirkpatrick's evaluative framework.","Initially, staff learners struggled to incorporate the 'whole-person' approach to dementia care, but gained knowledge and confidence through self-directed learning. They reacted positively to the training and appreciated opportunities to learn from peers in other services. They identified improvements in communication and prescribing practices, despite difficulties implementing changes during busy periods. Resultant impact for service users included more timely routine appointments, and positive satisfaction ratings from patients and families.","The findings indicate the perceived value of person-centred dementia education for primary care. Further recommendations for provision in this service setting include tailored programmes designed collaboratively with clinical service providers, and bringing together an interdisciplinary mix of

support those with age-related health conditions in the system. Existing work practices and organizational structures often fail to meet the needs of prisoners with dementia, and prison staff experience high levels of burden because of the increased needs of these prisoners. Little is known about the best method of responding to the needs of this growing subpopulation of prisoners.","A scoping review was conducted to answer the question: what are the perceived best care options for prisoners with dementia? To be included, publications had to be publicly available, reported on research findings, or viewed opinions and commentaries on care practices relevant to older prisoners with dementia. Searches were conducted in 11 databases to identify relevant publications. Data from the included publications were extracted and summarized into themes.","Eight themes were identified that could support better care practices for prisoners with dementia: (1) early and ongoing screening for older prisoners; (2) specialized services; (3) specialized units; (4) programs or activities; (5) adaptations to current contexts; (6) early release or parole for older prisoners with dementia deemed at low risk of reoffending; and (7) training younger prisoners (8) as well as staff to assist older prisoners with dementia. Besides practical strategies improving care practice, costs, prison-specific resources, and staff skills were highlighted as care barriers across all themes. A lack of empirical evidence supported these findings.","One of the implications of the international ageing prison population is the higher number of people living with dementia being incarcerated. Suggestions for best care approaches for prisoners with dementia now need to move from opinion to empirical approaches to guide practice."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"du Toit","ForeName":"Sanetta Henrietta Johanna","Initials":"SHJ","Identifier":"0000-0003-1348-6313","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Ageing, Work and Health Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Withall","ForeName":"Adrienne","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Loughlin","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Ageing, Work and Health Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ninaus","ForeName":"Nikola","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Ageing, Work and Health Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lovarini","ForeName":"Meryl","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Ageing, Work and Health Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Snoyman","ForeName":"Phillip","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Justice, Corrective Services, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Butler","ForeName":"Tony","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Justice Health Research Program, Kirby Institute, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Forsyth","ForeName":"Katrina","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Offender Health Research Network, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire A","Initials":"CA","Identifier":"0000-0002-4312-6661","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Research, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2019 Aug;31(8):1071-1074","PMID":"31469066"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Prisoners","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Prisons","QualifierName":"organization & administration"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ageing","care models","cognitive impairment","populations","prisons","vulnerable"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"4","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31412973","S1041610219000681","10.1017\/S1041610219000681"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"31342248","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"07","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2210-7711","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"41","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"International journal of clinical pharmacy","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Clin Pharm"},"ArticleTitle":"Pro re nata prescribing and administration for neuropsychiatric symptoms and pain in long-term care residents with dementia and memory problems: a cross-sectional study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1314-1322"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s11096-019-00883-7","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Background Prescribing, dispensing and administering pro re nata (PRN; as needed or necessary, as determined by an individual) medicines to people with intermittent or short-term conditions is a potential area for medication errors and inappropriate prescribing and administration. In people with dementia, regular PRN medicines use can demonstrate good practice when appropriate or poor in situations where their use is not recommended. However, the frequency of PRN prescription and administration within long-term care settings (care homes) for people with dementia is largely unknown. A limited number of studies worldwide suggest variation between countries. Objective To describe the prescription and administration rates of PRN medicines for people with dementia in UK care homes. Setting Fifty UK care homes. Method Medication details were collected from review of residents' medicines records within the care home for the previous month. Main outcome measure Prescription and administration of PRN medicines for the treatment of behaviours associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms and pain. Results The most commonly prescribed PRN medicines were analgesics (35.3%), although lower levels of PRN prescription were observed compared to recent studies. The percentage of residents receiving PRN administrations varied, with 20% for antipsychotics, 50% for benzodiazepines, 59% for analgesics, and 85.7% for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics being administered. Conclusion Further research is needed to understand the decision making in PRN prescription and administration within long-term care. The prescribing of potentially inappropriate medicines remains a problem in long-term care settings and pharmacists have a key role in reducing inappropriate polypharmacy by undertaking medication reviews that consider both regular and PRN medicines."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffiths","ForeName":"Alys

Ensuring this workforce is appropriately trained is of international concern. Research indicates variable impact of training on a range of resident and staff outcomes. Little is still known about the most effective approaches to the design, delivery and implementation of dementia training. This study aimed to investigate the features and contextual factors associated with an effective approach to care home staff training on dementia.","An embedded, collective case study was undertaken in three care home provider organisations who had responded to a national training audit. Data collected included individual or small group interviews with training leads, facilitators, staff attending training, managers, residents and their relatives. Observations of care practice were undertaken using Dementia Care Mapping. Training delivery was observed and training materials audited. A within case analysis of each site, followed by cross case analysis using convergence coding was undertaken.","All sites provided bespoke, tailored training, delivered largely using face-to-face, interactive methods, which staff and managers indicated were valuable and effective. Self-study booklets and on-line learning where were used, were poorly completed and disliked by staff. Training was said to improve empathy, knowledge about the lived experience of dementia and the importance of considering and meeting individual needs. Opportunities to continually reflect on learning and support to implement training in practice were valued and felt to be an essential component of good training. Practice developments as a result of training included improved communication, increased activity, less task-focussed care and increased resident well-being. However, observations indicated positive well-being and engagement was not a consistent experience across all residents in all sites. Barriers to training attendance and implementation were staff time, lack of dedicated training space and challenges in gaining feedback on training and its impact. Facilitators included a supportive organisational ethos and skilled training facilitation.","Effective training is tailored to learners', delivered face-to-face by an experienced facilitator, is interactive and is embedded within a supportive organisational culture\/ethos. Further research is needed on the practical aspects of sustainable and impactful dementia training delivery and implementation in care home

implementation within a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 (DCM) in UK care homes. DCM is a practice development tool comprised of a 5 component cycle (staff briefing, mapping observations, data analysis and reporting, staff feedback, and action planning) that supports delivery of person-centered care. Two staff from the 31 intervention care homes were trained in DCM and asked to deliver 3 cycles over a 15-month period, supported by a DCM expert during cycle 1. Implementation data were collected after each mapping cycle. There was considerable variability in DCM implementation fidelity, dose, and reach. Not all homes trained 2 mappers on schedule, and some found it difficult to retain mappers. Only 26% of homes completed more than 1 cycle. Future DCM trials in care home settings should consider additional methods to support intervention completion including intervention delivery being conducted with ongoing external support."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire

addressing complex behaviours and care needs such as agitation and anxiety, and for improving the quality of life of people with dementia in care homes. Dementia Care Mapping (DCM\u2122) is an established practice development tool and process aimed to help care home staff deliver more person-centred care. To date, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of DCM\u2122 and have found mixed results. These results are suggested to be the outcome of intervention implementation, which may be impacted by a range of factors. This study reports the barriers and facilitators to DCM\u2122 implementation in care homes found during the process evaluation conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial.","Eighteen of the 31 DCM\u2122 intervention care homes were recruited to participate in the embedded process evaluation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 83 participants, comprising care home managers, trained DCM\u2122 users (mappers), expert external mappers, staff members, relatives, and residents.","Barriers and facilitators to DCM\u2122 implementation were found at the mapper level (e.g. motivation and confidence), the DCM\u2122 intervention level (e.g. understanding of DCM\u2122) and the care home level (e.g. staffing issues, manager support). Further barriers caused by the burden of trial participation were also identified (e.g. additional paperwork).","Implementing DCM\u2122 is complex and a greater consideration of potential barriers and facilitators in planning future studies and in practice could help improve implementation.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82288852 , registered

process. Following training in the method, DCM is implemented via a cyclic process of briefing staff, conducting mapping observations, data analysis and report preparation, feedback to staff and action planning. Recent controlled studies of DCM's efficacy have found heterogeneous results, and variability in DCM implementation has been indicated as a potential contributing factor. This review aimed to examine the primary research evidence on the processes and the barriers and facilitators to implementing DCM as a practice development method within formal dementia care settings. PUBMED, PsycINFO, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library-Cochrane reviews, HMIC (Ovid), Web of Science and Social Care Online were searched using the term \"Dementia Care Mapping\". Inclusion criterion was primary research studies in any formal dementia care settings where DCM was used as a practice development tool and which included discussion\/critique of the implementation processes. Assessment of study quality was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Twelve papers were included in the review, representing nine research studies. The papers included discussion of various components of the DCM process, including mapper selection and preparation; mapping observations; data analysis, report writing and feedback; and action planning. However, robust evidence on requirements for successful implementation of these components was limited. Barriers and facilitators to mapping were also discussed. The review found some consensus that DCM is more likely to be successfully implemented if the right people are selected to be trained as mappers, with appropriate mapper preparation and ongoing support and with effective leadership for DCM within the implementing organization\/unit and in organizations that already have a person-centered culture or ethos. Future development of the DCM tool should consider ways to save on time taken to conduct DCM cycles. More research to understand the ingredients for effective DCM implementation is needed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire A","Initials":"CA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Research, School of Health and Community Studies, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffiths","ForeName":"Alys W","Initials":"AW","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Research, School of Health and Community Studies, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelley","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Research, School of Health and Community Studies, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"26"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Clin Interv Aging","NlmUniqueID":"101273480","ISSNLinking":"1176-9092"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Behavior Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","person-centered care","practice development","staff training"]},"CoiStatement":"Disclosure CAS has conducted research on DCM and its use, including the development of the current eighth edition of the tool, and has previously been an approved DCM trainer.

People with dementia occupy up to one quarter of acute hospital beds, however, staff working in hospitals report lack of knowledge and skills in caring for this group. There is limited evidence about the most effective approaches to training hospital staff on dementia.","The purpose of this literature review was to examine published evidence on the most effective approaches to dementia training and education for hospital staff.","The review was conducted using critical synthesis and included qualitative, quantitative and mixed\/multi- methods studies. Kirkpatrick's four level model for the evaluation of training interventions was adopted to structure the review.","The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, British Education Index, Education Abstracts, ERIC (EbscoHost), The Cochrane Library-Cochrane reviews, Economic evaluations, CENTRAL (Wiley), HMIC (Ovid), ASSIA, IBSS (Proquest), Conference Proceedings Citation Indexes (Web of Science), using a combination of keyword for the following themes: Dementia\/Alzheimer's, training\/education, staff knowledge and patient outcomes.","A total of 20 papers were included in the review, the majority of which were low or medium quality, impacting on generalisability. The 16 different training programmes evaluated in the studies varied in terms of duration and mode of delivery, although most employed face-to-face didactic techniques. Studies predominantly reported on reactions to training and knowledge, only one study evaluated outcomes across all of the levels of the Kirkpatrick model. Key features of training that appeared to be more acceptable and effective were identified related to training content, delivery methods, practicalities, duration and support for implementation.","The review methodology enabled inclusion of a broad range of studies and permitted common features of successful programmes to be identified. Such features may be used in the design of future dementia training programmes, to increase their potential for effectiveness. Further research on the features of effective dementia training for hospital staff is required."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia.

currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)].

quality has been widely encouraged. There has been limited application within dementia care. Dementia Care Mapping is an observational tool in widespread use, predominantly to assess and improve quality of care in single organisations. Dementia Care Mapping data have the potential to be used for secondary purposes to improve quality of care. However, its suitability for such use requires careful evaluation. This study conducted in-depth interviews with 29 Dementia Care Mapping users to identify issues, concerns and challenges regarding the secondary use of Dementia Care Mapping data. Data were analysed using modified Grounded Theory. Major themes identified included the need to collect complimentary contextual data in addition to Dementia Care Mapping data, to reassure users regarding ethical issues associated with storage and reuse of care related data and the need to assess and specify data quality for any data that might be available for secondary analysis."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Khalid","ForeName":"Shehla","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health and Community Studies, Leeds Beckett University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Neagu","ForeName":"Daniel","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Engineering and Informatics, University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Small","ForeName":"Neil","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health Studies, University of Bradford, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"03","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Computer Security"},{"DescriptorName":"Datasets as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Grounded Theory"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality Improvement"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia Care Mapping","data quality","grounded theory","quality of care","secondary use of data"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"3","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"3","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28358268","10.1177\/1471301217701275"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27341812","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"14"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"24"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 to enable person-centred care for people with dementia and their carers (DCM-EPIC) in care homes: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"300"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s13063-016-1416-z","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Up to 90 % of people living with dementia in care homes experience one or more behaviours that staff may describe as challenging to support (BSC). Of these agitation is the most common and difficult to manage. The presence of agitation is associated with fewer visits from relatives, poorer quality of life and social isolation. It is recommended that agitation is treated through psychosocial interventions. Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 (DCM\u2122) is an established, widely used observational tool and practice development cycle, for ensuring a systematic approach to providing person-centred care. There is a body of practice-based literature and experience to suggests that DCM\u2122 is potentially effective but limited robust evidence for its effectiveness, and no examination of its cost-effectiveness, as a UK health care intervention. Therefore, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of DCM\u2122 in the UK is urgently needed.","A pragmatic, multi-centre, cluster-randomised controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM\u2122) plus Usual Care (UC) versus UC alone, where UC is the normal care delivered within the care home following a minimum level of dementia awareness training. The trial will take place in residential, nursing and dementia-specialist care homes across West Yorkshire, Oxfordshire and London, with residents with dementia. A random sample of 50 care homes will be selected within which a minimum of 750 residents will be registered. Care homes will be randomised in an allocation ratio of 3:2 to receive either intervention or control. Outcome measures will be obtained at 6 and 16 months following randomisation. The primary outcome is agitation as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, at 16 months post randomisation. Key secondary outcomes are other BSC and quality of life. There will be an integral cost-effectiveness analysis and a process evaluation.","The protocol was refined following a pilot of trial procedures. Changes include replacement of a questionnaire, whose wording caused some residents distress, to an adapted version specifically designed for use in care homes, a change to the randomisation stratification factors, adaption in how the staff measures are collected to encourage greater compliance, and additional reminders to intervention homes of when mapping cycles are due, via text message.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82288852 .

(~10 minutes per visit) for 12 weeks. They used improvisation, humor, empathy, and expressive modalities such as song, musical instruments, and dance to individualize resident engagement.","Primary outcomes were BPSD measured using the the NPI-NH, quality of life measured using Dementia Care Mapping (DCM), and nursing burden of care measured using the Modified Nursing Care Assessment Scale (M-NCAS). Secondary outcomes were occupational disruptiveness measured using the NPI-NH, agitation measured using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and psychiatric medication use.","Over 12 weeks, NPI-NH scores declined significantly (t22 = -2.68, P = .01), and DCM quality-of-life scores improved significantly (F1,50 = 23.09, P < .001). CMAI agitation scores decreased nominally, but the difference was not statistically significant (t22 = -1.86, P = .07). Occupational disruptiveness score significantly improved (t22 = -2.58, P = .02), but there was no appreciable change in M-NCAS scores of staff burden of care.","Results suggest that elder-clowning reduced moderate to severe BPSD of nursing home residents with dementia, primarily of the Alzheimer's type.

DCM was previously piloted on a neurorehabilitation ward, where it was found to be feasible and acceptable in this setting. Following this, a new modified tool and accompanying manual were developed: Care Mapping - Neurorehabilitation (DCM-NR). The current study aimed to assess the feasibility and validity of DCM-NR by piloting its use in a range of clinical neuroscience settings. A mixed-methods design was used employing both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The new DCM-NR was found to be feasible for use both in terms of the suitability of its coding system and the implementation process. DCM-NR was shown to have a moderate level of concurrent validity with participants' self-report of PCC. Participants' subjective reports on their experiences of care provided validation for the areas of psychological need observed in DCM-NR. The results of this study indicate that DCM-NR is feasible and valid for use in a range of clinical neuroscience settings. Further longitudinal research is required to evaluate the impact of DCM-NR on PCC practices over time.

Q-methodology, a technique for extracting subjective opinions, was used with 23 staff and 10 patients on the ward to evaluate the acceptability of DCM.","Factor analysis was performed separately for staff and patient Q-sorts. Each found a \"consensus\" factor where all participants indicated positive acceptability for the use of DCM. Further exploratory factors indicated that some staff\/patients had additional views\/concerns that were not captured by the first consensus factor.","The results from this preliminary study are promising and indicate that DCM is potentially an acceptable tool to use in acute neuro-rehabilitation.

The present study aimed to explore how differing degrees of awareness are manifested in the conversations and interactions of people with dementia living in residential care settings, and to identify theoretical and practical implications. Transcripts of 304 conversations with 80 individuals with dementia living in residential care homes in England and Wales were analysed using a grounded theory approach. All 80 participants demonstrated a degree of retained awareness, and there was considerable evidence of retained awareness throughout the conversations, expressed in relation to the three domains of self, relationship, and the environmental context. Two-thirds of participants also demonstrated at least one instance of unawareness, although demonstrations of retained awareness outweighed indications of unawareness. Unawareness was evident in relation to appraisal of functioning and the meaning ascribed to the situation. A grounded theory model of awareness in people with moderate to severe dementia who still communicate verbally proposes that demonstration of awareness involves a set of analytic and behavioural processes, a scope or timescale, and a focus. Awareness is demonstrated in relation to a given focus and scope through the involvement of cognitive processes of varying degrees of complexity, ranging from registering through appraising and interpreting to reflection. Unawareness may be demonstrated in relation to some elements of process, focus or scope, while other aspects remain unaffected. Understanding more about the capacity for retained awareness and the specific ways in which awareness can be compromised may assist care staff in responding effectively to residents' needs."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rowlands","ForeName":"Julia","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bruce","ForeName":"Errollyn","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Soc Sci Med","NlmUniqueID":"8303205","ISSNLinking":"0277-9536"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Ego"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"23"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"8","Day":"30","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18325650","S0277-9536(08)00045-2","10.1016\/j.socscimed.2008.01.045"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16955431","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"09","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia Care Mapping (DCM): initial validation of DCM 8 in UK field trials.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1018-25"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This paper describes DCM 8 and reports on the initial validation study of DCM 8.","Between 2001-2003, a series of international expert working groups were established to examine various aspects of DCM with the intention of revising and refining it.

The theoretical literature suggests that interpersonal relationships, the social context, and the generation of stories are important in maintenance of self. Empirical research on self in dementia supports this but has been predominantly conducted with participants living in the community. Living in residential care brings additional threats to self. This paper presents a study examining the relevance of a socio-biographical theory of self to people with dementia living in residential care. Between 3 and 8 tape-recorded and transcribed unstructured interviews were conducted with 14 people with dementia who were living in 4 residential homes throughout England and Wales, over a 6-24-month period. They were analysed using an interpretive biographical methodology. The results provide evidence to support the relevance of a socio-biographical theory of self to this group. Relationships with family, other residents and care home staff were important for maintenance of self. Social roles related to work, being part of a family, caring for others and being cared for, were particularly significant for self in this group. The creation of a life story, stories of selected life events, and the telling of stories with possible metaphorical interpretations were also important for the maintenance of self. The results also suggest that psychological and embodied factors may be relevant to the self in dementia. The study suggests that staff working in residential homes should consider these elements if they are to provide care that supports maintenance of self for people with dementia.
