Namaste Care provides a structured daily programme of physical, sensory and emotional care delivered by regular care workers. A three-year, mixed method process study of implementation and impact created a manualised Namaste Care Intervention for UK care homes (NCI-UK). This article reports on the impact of NCI-UK delivered consistently in five care homes for 12-24 weeks. Impact for residents was assessed using, pre-post data, showing significant positive effects for QUALID ( = 2.92,  = 0.01,  = 31) and CMAI ( = 3.31,  = 0.002,  = 32), alongside many qualitative examples of positive impacts on wellbeing, responsiveness and communication. Pre-post staff questionnaire data ( = 20) were not significant. Qualitative data indicated that NCI-UK is a positive staff experience, providing sense of purpose, improved wellbeing and relationships. The care homes reported benefiting from implementing NCI-UK in terms of reputation and quality improvement. Family interviews were also positive, relating to seeing the difference, improving relationships and being involved. NCI-UK can therefore be recommended as an impactful intervention for residents, staff and families."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Latham","ForeName":"Isabelle","Initials":"I","Identifier":"0000-0002-1096-778X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester WR2 6AJ, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester WR2 6AJ, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bray","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0002-1315-7643","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester WR2 6AJ, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jacobson-Wright","ForeName":"Nicola","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester WR2 6AJ, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Frost","ForeName":"Faith","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester WR2 6AJ, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"18"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Switzerland","MedlineTA":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","NlmUniqueID":"101238455","ISSNLinking":"1660-4601"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Care Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality Improvement"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["advanced dementia","care homes","change","implementation","long term care","namaste care","psychosocial intervention"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2020","Month":"06","Day":"12"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2020","Month":"8","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2020","Month":"8","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"12","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["32824847","ijerph17166004","10.3390\/ijerph17166004","PMC7459821"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Dementia (London). 2017 Jan;16(1):67-78","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25883036"}},{"Citation":"Nurs Older People. 2019 Jan 24;31(1):22-28","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"31468919"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2015 Oct;27(10):1623-34","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25573531"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2005 Mar;17(1):31-40","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15945590"}},{"Citation":"BMC Geriatr. 2018 Dec 6;18(1):303","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"30522450"}},{"Citation":"Palliat Med. 2014 Mar;28(3):197-209","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23828874"}},{"Citation":"Health Technol Assess. 2020 Jan;24(6):1-140","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"31971506"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 1982 Sep;139(9):1136-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7114305"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 1996;8 Suppl 3:309-15;

Community-based interventions can play a key role in supporting people with early to moderate stage dementia postdiagnosis, helping delay decline and hospitalisation. However, provision of such interventions is fragmented, with significant gaps and no reliable funding model, hence innovative groups and schemes catering for a genuine need can struggle long term and frequently fold.","This realist review aims to expand our understanding of how best to implement and facilitate community-based interventions to run sustainably, focusing on contextually relevant explanations. We will gather and synthesise literature using a realist approach designed to accommodate and account for the complexity of 'real life' programmes, as implemented under different conditions in different settings, aiming to draw transferable conclusions about their sustainability that explain how and why context can influence outcomes. Our review will iteratively progress through five steps: (1) locate existing theories; (2) search for evidence (using Academic Search, AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Social Care Online, between May and September 2019); (3) article selection; (4) extracting and organising data; (5) synthesising the evidence and drawing conclusions. Data analysis will use a realist logic to explain what works, for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects, how and why. A stakeholder group will provide guidance and feedback throughout.","Ethical approval was not required. Recommendations drawn from results are likely to be of interest to a range of stakeholders including those commissioning, planning, running, supporting or attending such interventions, as well as policymakers, healthcare professionals and researchers. We will draw on the expertise of our stakeholder group regarding tailoring dissemination to each audience using a variety of materials, formats and channels."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Dementia training in hospitals is often inadequate and staff do not always have sufficient knowledge of dementia to provide appropriate care. It can also be difficult for them to identify when patients with dementia are in pain, especially when their communication skills deteriorate. The case studies presented illustrate how two NHS trusts have worked to ensure that their staff are fully equipped to care for people with dementia in hospital. Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in Essex made dementia training a priority by including dementia awareness in staff induction across a range of roles and providing additional training activities tailored to meet staff needs. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust focused on pain assessment, aiming to standardise its approach for patients with dementia. The pain assessment in advanced dementia tool was chosen and piloted, and is being implemented across the trust after a positive response.

The hospital environment is often disorientating for people with dementia and can be particularly distressing when a patient is admitted in an emergency. Subsequent ward moves can also be disruptive and confusing, especially if they take place out of hours. Two NHS trusts aimed to improve the experience for patients with dementia by addressing the physical environment along with practical aspects of care provision at different stages in the hospital journey. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King's Lynn NHS Foundation Trust in Norfolk enhanced its emergency department environment by redesigning four bays and an observation area to be dementia-friendly. The hospital has supported these changes by providing dementia awareness training for all staff in these areas. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust focused on minimising ward moves by implementing procedures to identify patients who should not be moved. Since introducing the new process, adherence has been good and there have been fewer ward moves.

Combined with a lack of activities and stimulation for patients with dementia in hospital, this can result in poor engagement and a disconnect between staff and patients. To improve these relationships and give staff more time with patients, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has introduced bay nursing for patients with dementia, where one nurse is responsible for monitoring a bay alongside a healthcare assistant for an entire shift. Part of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Glan Clwyd Hospital in north Wales has focused on improving stimulation by creating an activity room with a specially trained activity worker, providing a relaxed and friendly setting where patients with dementia can take part in a range of activities and have lunch together.

When a person with dementia is in hospital, poor understanding of individual needs and preferences can contribute to a lack of person-centred care. Similarly, the needs of family carers can often be overlooked and staff do not always appreciate these needs at such a stressful time. This article illustrates how three NHS trusts have addressed these issues. To help staff get to know patients with dementia, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust has implemented a patient passport. Similarly, The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has implemented a carer passport that overcomes the restrictions imposed by hospital visiting hours. Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust also focused on carers, holding a workshop to elicit feedback on what was important to them. This was a useful means of engaging with carers and helped staff to realise that even simple changes can have a significant effect.

This intervention was scaled up from an earlier cluster randomised-controlled trial that had proven successful in significantly decreasing antipsychotic prescribing in care homes.","An in depth 10-day education course in person-centred care was delivered over a three-month period, followed by six supervision sessions. Participants were care-home staff designated as Dementia Care Coaches (DCCs) responsible for implementing interventions in 1 or 2 care homes. The course and supervision was provided by educators called Dementia Practice Development Coaches (DPDCs). Effectiveness data included monitoring antipsychotic prescriptions, goal attainment, knowledge, attitudes and implementation questionnaires. Qualitative data included case studies and reflective journals to elucidate issues of implementation.","Of the 100 DCCs recruited, 66 DCCs completed the programme. Pre-post questionnaires demonstrated increased knowledge and confidence and improved attitudes to dementia. Twenty per cent of residents were prescribed antipsychotics at baseline which reduced to 14% (31% reduction) with additional dose reductions being reported alongside improved personalised goal attainment. Crucial for FITS into Practice to succeed was the allocation and protection of time for the DCC to attend training and supervision and to carry out implementation tasks in addition to their existing job role. Evaluation data showed that this was a substantial barrier to implementation in a small number of homes.","The FITS into practice programme was well evaluated and resulted in reduction in inappropriate anti-psychotic prescribing.

This paper reports on timely diagnosis.","Evidence was reviewed from scientific, policy and qualitative research. An online questionnaire was completed by experts from 24 European Union countries detailing current practice. An iterative process with people with dementia, family carers and professionals was utilised to develop recommendations.","Advances in the technical aspects of diagnosis have changed what is understood by early diagnosis. Although research into preclinical stages is crucial, diagnosing at these very earliest stages is not recommended as regular practice. On balance, it is suggested that citizens should have access to accurate diagnosis at a time in the disease process when it can be of most benefit to them. The term timely diagnosis is used to reflect this. The diagnosis can help citizens and their families make sense of what is happening and make lifestyle changes and plans for the future. The central principles identified to maximise benefit and to reduce harm associated with diagnosis at an earlier stage included reducing stigma about dementia; respecting the rights of the individual; recognising that how the diagnosis is given will impact on subsequent adjustment and that post diagnostic support are required for the person and their family. Detailed recommendations are provided for timely detection, the diagnostic process, complex diagnoses, response to early cognitive changes and workforce.","The recommendations can be utilised at a local, national and European level to benchmark progress."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"La Fontaine","ForeName":"Jenny","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Evans","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bray","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Saad","ForeName":"Karim","Initials":"K"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"01","Day":"24"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Accessibility","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health Services","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Public Health","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ALCOVE","dementia","timely diagnosis"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2013","Month":"06","Day":"15"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"26"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"2","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24458456","10.1002\/gps.4066"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23268978","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0300-9173","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"49","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2012"}},"Title":"Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi.

The purpose of this study was to clarify that well-being and ill-being (WIB) levels affects the behavior category code (BCC) in long-term care insurance facilities.","In this study, we evaluated people with dementia who used care facilities between April 2005 and July 2007. The evaluation indices used were the 6-hour DCM, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Gottfries-Brane-Steen Scale (GBS).","The total number of subjects whose families submitted written informed consent to participate was 256 (50 men and 206 women). The mean MMSE score of the total subjects was 10.83 (\u00b18.58), and that of individuals receiving home care was the highest 17.14 (\u00b16.38). The next highest mean MMSE score was that of the group home residents: 16.56 (\u00b16.83). The lowest mean MMSE score was of individuals in health services facilities for the elderly (serious dementia ward), at 2.16 (\u00b13.88). Multiple regression analysis was performed after controlling for age, sex, type of dementia and GBS, and we used the WIB value as dependent variables. The BCC variables of L (Labor) in group homes, and E (Expression) and H (handicrafts) variables in welfare institutions and long-term care facilities for the elderly significantly promoted WIB value.","Among BCC indices such as L in group homes, and E and H in welfare institutions and long-term care facilities for the elderly, which reflect WIB values (and therefore, quality of life), it was found that those activities associated with work reflected quality of care. However, the BCC indices of B (Borderline) C (Cool), and U (Unresponsiveness) significantly inhibited WIB level; these behaviors are categorized as passive behaviors in the DCM. It is probable that these behaviors in elderly people with dementia reflect problems in long-term care insurance facilities. It is necessary to further examine these passive behaviors, because they can accurately reflect the quality of care for elderly people with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Suzuki","ForeName":"Mizue","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Hamamatsu University."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mizuno","ForeName":"Yutaka","Initials":"Y"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ooshiro","ForeName":"Hajime","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kanamori","ForeName":"Masao","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"jpn","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Japan","MedlineTA":"Nihon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi","NlmUniqueID":"7507332","ISSNLinking":"0300-9173"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Day Care, Medical"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"12","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"12","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23268978","DN\/JST.JSTAGE\/geriatrics\/49.355","10.3143\/geriatrics.49.355"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23127509","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"02","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2013","Month":"06","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1477-1128","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"14","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Primary health care research & development","ISOAbbreviation":"Prim Health Care Res Dev"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia skills and competencies for primary care liaison: a model for improving identification and timely diagnosis.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"240-9"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1463423612000266","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The need to improve the response of primary care in terms of identification of people with undiagnosed dementia has long been recognised.

However, the reliability and validity of the Dementia Care Mapping-Japanese version (DCM-J) has not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to clarify the reliability and validity of the Well-being and Ill-being (WIB) value of the DCM-J as a method for evaluating quality of life.","The study was conducted from April 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006. The participants included 130 elderly patients (men 31, women 99, average age 82.65+\/-7.69 years) who were given a diagnosis of dementia. We established inter-rater reliability during a parallel observation method and also used test-retest for reliability. The correlation between the WIB value of the DCM-J and the Japanese Quality of Life Inventory for Elderly with Dementia (QOL-D) was used to establish criterion-related validity.","Forty-nine (37.7%) subjects were given a diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type, 80 (61.5%) had vascular dementia and 1 (0.8%) had dementia with Lewy bodies. The results showed correlation between the WIB value and social withdrawal measured by the behavioral category code (BCC) on the DCM-J and the three subscales of QOL-D: \"interacting with surroundings\", \"expressing self\", and \"experiencing minimum negative behaviors\". There was good internal consistency among these items. The interclass correlation coefficient was 82.32 (+\/-5.85) for the WIB value of the DCM-J. The correlation coefficient of the retest, administered one week later, was 0.836 (p=0.001). The WIB value was significantly correlated with three sub-scales of QOL-D, and the correlation coefficient was greater than 0.53.","We demonstrated that the WIB value of the DCM-J has good inter-rater reliability and test re-test reliability and criterion-related validity. In this study, the WIB value was shown to have similar reliability to the WIB value of the original DCM. Furthermore, our results suggest that the DCM-J could be useful for evaluating quality of life among elderly Japanese patients with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Suzuki","ForeName":"Mizue","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing, Mie Prefectural College of Nursing."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mizuno","ForeName":"Yutaka","Initials":"Y"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sumigaki","ForeName":"Chieko","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sakamoto","ForeName":"Ryoko","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Uchida","ForeName":"Astuko","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Greiner","ForeName":"Chieko","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ooshiro","ForeName":"Hajime","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kanamori","ForeName":"Masao","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"jpn","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Japan","MedlineTA":"Nihon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi","NlmUniqueID":"7507332","ISSNLinking":"0300-9173"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Japan"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychological Tests","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"4","Day":"23","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18332575","JST.JSTAGE\/geriatrics\/45.68","10.3143\/geriatrics.45.68"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17612801","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"09","Day":"06"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1360-7863","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"11","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Enriching opportunities for people living with dementia: the development of a blueprint for a sustainable activity-based model.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"371-83"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The aim of this paper is to describe the process of building a multi-level intervention called the Enriched Opportunities Programme, the objective of which is to provide a sustainable activity-based model for people with dementia living in long-term care.
