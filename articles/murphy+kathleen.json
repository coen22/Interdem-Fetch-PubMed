The presence of hallucinations, along with fluctuations in the level of arousal and sleep disturbance, point to potential pathological mechanisms at the level of the thalamus. However, the potential role of thalamic dysfunction in DLB, particularly as it relates to the presence of formed visual hallucinations is not known. Here, we review the literature on the pathophysiology of DLB with respect to modern theories of thalamocortical function and attempt to derive an understanding of how such hallucinations arise. Based on the available literature, we propose that combined thalamic-thalamic reticular nucleus and thalamocortical pathology may explain the phenomenology of visual hallucinations in DLB. In particular, diminished \u03b17 cholinergic activity in the thalamic reticular nucleus may critically disinhibit thalamocortical activity. Further, concentrated pathological changes within the posterior regions of the thalamus may explain the predilection for the hallucinations to be visual in nature.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two care areas that pose specific challenges for SPC nurses when caring for people with advanced dementia are pain and nutrition\/hydration. Assessment and management of pain for a patient who has advanced dementia differs greatly from that for a typical palliative care patient. Similarly, nutrition and hydration pose extraordinary ethical and practical dilemmas not encountered when caring for a patient without dementia. This paper reports a literature review which revealed that although evidence-based information related to each of these areas is available, it tends to be written from the perspective of health professionals with an interest in dementia rather than from the perspective of the SPC nurse. SPC nurses require evidence-based palliative care research to guide their practice, but such research appears to be limited for patients with advanced dementia. Knowledge from specialists in both dementia care and palliative care needs to be combined if we are to provide these patients with the best possible end-of-life care. Further research is required and evidenced-based guidelines need to be formulated."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Barber","ForeName":"Jean","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"St. Michael's Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin, Ireland. j.barber@stmichaels.ie"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murphy","ForeName":"Kathleen","Initials":"K"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Palliat Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9506762","ISSNLinking":"1357-6321"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dehydration","QualifierName":["complications","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurses"},{"DescriptorName":"Nutritional Status"},{"DescriptorName":"Pain Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Palliative Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Specialties, Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Workforce"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22240740","10.12968\/ijpn.2011.17.12.587"]}}}]}
