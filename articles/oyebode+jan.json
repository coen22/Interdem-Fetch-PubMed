Many people with dementia receive informal\/family\/unpaid care, for example, from a spouse or child, which may affect carer quality of life. Measuring the effectiveness of health\/social care interventions for carers requires a value measure of the quality-of-life impact of caring. This motivated development of the Scales Measuring the Impact of Dementia on Carers-D (SIDECAR-D) instrument. This study aimed to obtain general population values for SIDECAR-D to aid incorporating the impact of caring in economic evaluation.","Members of the UK general public completed a best-worst scaling object case survey, which included the 18 SIDECAR-D items and EQ-5D-3L descriptions. Responses were analyzed using scale-adjusted finite mixture models. Relative importance scores (RISs) for the 18 SIDECAR-D items formed the SIDECAR-D relative scale measuring the relative impact of caring. The SIDECAR-D tariff, on the full health\u00a0= 1, dead\u00a0= 0 scale, was derived by rescaling EQ-5D-3L and SIDECAR-D RISs so the EQ-5D-3L RISs equaled anchored valuations of the EQ-5D-3L pits state from a visual analog scale task.","Five hundred ten respondents completed the survey. The model had 2 parameter and 3 scale classes. Additive utility decrements of SIDECAR-D items ranged from -0.05 to -0.162. Utility scores range from 0.95 for someone affirming 1 item to -0.297 for someone affirming all\u00a018.","SIDECAR-D is a needs-based scale of the impact on quality of life of caring for someone with dementia, with a valuation tariff to support its use in economic evaluation."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2020 ISPOR\u2013The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research.

good quality person-centred care that meets the often complex needs of this population is required. Given the majority of people with dementia live in the community, significant care and support will be provided by primary care services. This means the primary care workforce needs appropriate education to ensure they have the right knowledge, skills and attitudes to meet these care needs. However, little is understood about the most successful approaches to dementia education in this setting.","An in-depth case study was undertaken in a single primary care organisation with the aim of exploring the impact of a person-centred dementia educational programme, and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. Data was gathered from a wide range of sources and analysed using Kirkpatrick's evaluative framework.","Initially, staff learners struggled to incorporate the 'whole-person' approach to dementia care, but gained knowledge and confidence through self-directed learning. They reacted positively to the training and appreciated opportunities to learn from peers in other services. They identified improvements in communication and prescribing practices, despite difficulties implementing changes during busy periods. Resultant impact for service users included more timely routine appointments, and positive satisfaction ratings from patients and families.","The findings indicate the perceived value of person-centred dementia education for primary care. Further recommendations for provision in this service setting include tailored programmes designed collaboratively with clinical service providers, and bringing together an interdisciplinary mix of learners to enhance knowledge exchange."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sass","ForeName":"Cara","Initials":"C","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5155-903X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

Ensuring this workforce is appropriately trained is of international concern. Research indicates variable impact of training on a range of resident and staff outcomes. Little is still known about the most effective approaches to the design, delivery and implementation of dementia training. This study aimed to investigate the features and contextual factors associated with an effective approach to care home staff training on dementia.","An embedded, collective case study was undertaken in three care home provider organisations who had responded to a national training audit. Data collected included individual or small group interviews with training leads, facilitators, staff attending training, managers, residents and their relatives. Observations of care practice were undertaken using Dementia Care Mapping. Training delivery was observed and training materials audited. A within case analysis of each site, followed by cross case analysis using convergence coding was undertaken.","All sites provided bespoke, tailored training, delivered largely using face-to-face, interactive methods, which staff and managers indicated were valuable and effective. Self-study booklets and on-line learning where were used, were poorly completed and disliked by staff. Training was said to improve empathy, knowledge about the lived experience of dementia and the importance of considering and meeting individual needs. Opportunities to continually reflect on learning and support to implement training in practice were valued and felt to be an essential component of good training. Practice developments as a result of training included improved communication, increased activity, less task-focussed care and increased resident well-being. However, observations indicated positive well-being and engagement was not a consistent experience across all residents in all sites. Barriers to training attendance and implementation were staff time, lack of dedicated training space and challenges in gaining feedback on training and its impact. Facilitators included a supportive organisational ethos and skilled training facilitation.","Effective training is tailored to learners', delivered face-to-face by an experienced facilitator, is interactive and is embedded within a supportive organisational culture\/ethos. Further research is needed on the practical aspects of sustainable and impactful dementia training delivery and implementation in care home settings."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire

Measures of caregiver well-being (self-efficacy, stress, burden, frequency of patient symptoms, and caregiver reactions) were explored for use in a subsequent trial.","Participants logged in online on average once a week over a 6-week period, consulting approximately 31% of programme content. Seventy percent of participants described the programme as useful and easy to use. Eighty-five percent expressed intent to use the resource in the future. Reductions in reported levels of stress and caregivers' negative reactions to memory symptoms were observed following use of the programme.","Results indicated that the RHAPSODY programme was acceptable and useful to caregivers.

Following a baseline assessment and goal-setting to identify areas of everyday functioning that could be improved or better managed, participants were randomised (1\u2009:\u20091) via secure web access to an independent randomisation centre to receive either TAU or CR and followed up at 3 and 9 months post randomisation.","Community.","Participants had an , Tenth Edition, diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or vascular or mixed dementia, had mild to moderate cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination score of \u2265\u200918 points), were stable on medication if prescribed, and had a family carer who was willing to contribute. The exclusion criteria were people with a history of brain injury or other neurological disorder and an inability to speak English. To achieve adequate power, we needed 350 people to complete the trial, with 175 people in each trial arm.","Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of 10 therapy sessions over 3 months, followed by four maintenance sessions over 6 months, delivered in participants' homes. The therapists were nine occupational therapists and one nurse.","The primary outcome was self-reported goal attainment at 3 months. Goal attainment was also assessed at 9 months. Carers provided independent ratings of goal attainment at both time points. The secondary outcomes were participant quality of life, mood, self-efficacy and cognition, and carer stress, health status and quality of life. The assessments at 3 and 9 months were conducted by researchers who were blind to the participants' group allocation.","A total of 475 participants were randomised (CR arm, \u2009=\u2009239; TAU arm, \u2009=\u2009236), 427 participants (90%) completed the trial and 426 participants were analysed (CR arm, \u2009=\u2009208, TAU arm, \u2009=\u2009218). At 3 months, there were statistically significant large positive effects for participant-rated goal attainment [mean change in the CR arm: 2.57; mean change in the TAU arm: 0.86; Cohen's\u2009=\u20090.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.19], corroborated by carer ratings (Cohen's\u2009=\u20091.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34). These effects were maintained at 9 months for both the participant ratings (Cohen's \u2009=\u20090.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17) and the carer ratings (Cohen's \u2009=\u20090.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.20). There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes. In the cost-utility analyses, there was no evidence of cost-effectiveness in terms of gains in the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the person with dementia (measured using the DEMentia Quality Of Life questionnaire utility score) or the QALYs of the carer (measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version) from either cost perspective. In the cost-effectiveness analyses, by reference to the primary outcome of participant-rated goal attainment, CR was cost-effective from both the health and social care perspective and the societal perspective at willingness-to-pay values of \u00a32500 and above for improvement in the goal attainment measure. There was no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the self-efficacy measure (the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale) from either cost perspective.","Possible limitations arose from the non-feasibility of using observational outcome measures, the lack of a general measure of functional ability and the exclusion of people without a carer or with rarer forms of dementia.","Cognitive rehabilitation is clinically effective in enabling people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy sessions.","Next steps will focus on the implementation of CR into NHS and social care services and on extending the approach to people with rarer forms of dementia.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN21027481.","This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 23, No. 10.

intervention to help people with early-stage dementia to manage everyday activities. This individualised therapy is conducted in people\u2019s own homes over several sessions. A therapist works with the person and the carer to identify realistic and relevant goals, plan how to tackle these and support people in achieving them. Previous small studies suggested that CR could be beneficial.","The Goal-oriented cognitive Rehabilitation in Early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias: multicentre single-blind randomised controlled Trial (GREAT) was run in eight centres to find out whether or not CR improves everyday functioning. Participants were in the early stages of having Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia or mixed dementia, with a family carer involved. At the first assessment, participants identified areas in which they would like to see improvements, and set goals. Participants and carers rated how well participants were currently doing in relation to these goals and completed questionnaires, for example about mood and quality of life. Participants were then randomly selected to either receive CR or continue with treatment as usual (TAU). CR consisted of 10 weekly sessions with the therapist over 3 months, followed by four sessions over the next 6 months. Participants were reassessed after 3 and 9 months.","We included 475 participants, and 427 participants (90%) completed the trial (209 participants in the CR arm and 218 participants in the TAU arm). After 3 months, the ratings by both participants and carers in the CR group showed that participants were doing significantly better in relation to their goals, and this was maintained 6 months later. Ratings for the TAU-arm participants did not improve significantly. There were no other differences between the groups. There was a strong economic case for CR.","Cognitive rehabilitation is effective in enabling people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy sessions. Next steps will focus on the implementation of CR into NHS and social care services."]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING","ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE","FUNCTIONAL ABILITY","MIXED DEMENTIA","REABLEMENT","RESTORATIVE CARE","TERTIARY PREVENTION","VASCULAR DEMENTIA"]},"CoiStatement":"Martin Knapp received funding from Lundbeck Limited (St Albans, UK) in relation to work on depression in younger adults and workplace mental health and from Takeda UK Limited (High Wycombe, UK) for advice on measures of the impact on carers of caring for people with dementia.

There is a growing literature on the theoretical underpinning on patient and public involvement including level and processes of involvement. The aim of this paper is to describe a person-centred and culturally sensitive approach to working with minority ethnic communities, involving carers, people living with dementia, members of the public and carer support workers, as used in the Caregiving HOPE study; and the influence of the approach on the study's research processes and outcomes. Patient and public involvement members were considered experts by experience and involved with study conception, design, conduct and dissemination. The perspective of the experts by experience is also presented in this article. The level and nature of involvement was influenced by each individual's needs and desires which changed over the course of the study. The approach had a significant impact on study outcomes as evidenced by successful recruitment and engagement at a national level, but was not without challenges with greater flexibility required and fuller consideration of financial and time costs required. Benefits of the approach included strong engagement, improved outcomes (successful recruitment of seldom heard groups) and meaningful relationships between researchers and experts by experience. A person-centred and culturally sensitive approach is required with patient and public involvement to ensure involvement is not detrimental to those involved, is meaningful and enjoyable and has a positive impact on the research."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parveen","ForeName":"Sahdia","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Barker","ForeName":"Sandra","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Society, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kaur","ForeName":"Ripaljeet","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Touchstone, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kerry","ForeName":"Fionnuala","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mitchell","ForeName":"Wendy","Initials":"W","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Society, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Happs","ForeName":"Alex","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fry","ForeName":"Gary","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morrison","ForeName":"Val","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fortinsky","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Connecticut, USA."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan R","Initials":"JR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Asia"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Participation"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Ethnic Groups","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Minority Groups","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["BAME","caregivers","dementia","minority ethnic","patient and public involvement","south Asian"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30373461","10.1177\/1471301218789558"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30315554","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"02","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1178-1661","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"02"}},"Title":"The patient","ISOAbbreviation":"Patient"},"ArticleTitle":"Development of an Item Pool for a Needs-Based Measure of Quality of Life of Carers of a Family Member with Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"125-136"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s40271-018-0334-4","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This paper describes the development of an item pool for a needs-based self-report outcome measure of the impact of caring for a relative, friend or neighbour with dementia on carer quality of life.

leading to the development and delivery of various dementia awareness initiatives. These initiatives have generally been aimed at adults; however, to sustain dementia friendly communities, the involvement of young people is imperative. Very few dementia awareness initiatives exist for young people, and none have been independently evaluated to establish their impact. This research aimed to design and develop a scale to measure adolescents' attitudes towards dementia to allow such initiatives to be evaluated.","The Adolescent Attitudes toward Dementia Scale was developed in 2 stages. Firstly, cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 young people, and secondly, a new scale (based on items from 2 existing scales) was piloted with 262 young people, recruited through schools.","A scale consisting of 23 items was developed. Exploratory factor analysis demonstrated that this captured 3 factors: perceptions of dementia, personal sacrifice, and empathy with people living with dementia. The 3 sub-scales showed adequate internal consistency (>.60), correlated with the original scales (r\u00a0=\u00a0.79-.91, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and correlated with an existing measure of attitudes towards older people at a similar level to the original scales (r\u00a0=\u00a0.47, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).","The scale will allow the evaluation of educational initiatives for young people and provide a validated and standardised measure to establish adolescents' attitudes towards dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffiths","ForeName":"Alys Wyn","Initials":"AW","Identifier":"0000-0001-9388-9168","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Research, Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parveen","ForeName":"Sahdia","Initials":"S","Identifier":"0000-0002-5041-5306","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Shafiq","ForeName":"Saba","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan R","Initials":"JR","Identifier":"0000-0002-0263-8740","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Applied Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude"},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Factor Analysis, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Public Opinion"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["adolescent attitudes","dementia","illness perceptions","measurement"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"20"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2018","Month":"04","Day":"03"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"4","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29851166","10.1002\/gps.4907"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29562360","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1758-5341","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"58","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"03","Day":"19"}},"Title":"The Gerontologist","ISOAbbreviation":"Gerontologist"},"ArticleTitle":"A Needs-led Framework for Understanding the Impact of Caring for a Family Member With Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e68-e77"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/geront\/gnx148","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Approximately half the care for people with dementia is provided by families. It is therefore imperative that research informs ways of maintaining such care. In this study, we propose that a needs-led approach can provide a useful, novel means of conceptualizing the impact of caring on the lives of family carers. Our aim was to develop and present a needs-led framework for understanding how providing care impacts on carers' fulfilment of needs.","In this qualitative study, we conducted 42 semistructured interviews with a purposively diverse sample of family carers to generate nuanced contextualized accounts of how caring impacted on carers' lives. Our inductive thematic analysis focused upon asking: \"What need is being impacted here?\" in order to generate a needs-led framework for understanding.","Nine themes were widely endorsed. Each completed the sentence: \"Being a carer impacts on fulfilling my need to\/for\u2026.\": Freedom; feel close to my relative; feel in control of my life; be my own person; protect my relative; share\/express my thoughts and feelings; take care of myself; feel connected to the people around me; get things done.","These needs echo those from other research areas, with relational needs emerging as particularly central. The needs-led approach offers a perspective that is able to capture both stresses and positive aspects of caregiving. We recommend that clinical interviewing using Socratic questioning to discover human needs that are being impacted by caring would provide a valuable starting point for care

Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 participants, and 37 participated in a pre-post knowledge quiz. Seven family interviews were conducted with 17 participants, and 3 families were followed up after 6\u00a0months.

Participants became more aware of available services and accessed services to make use of practical support. IPSAF was reported to have an impact for people living with dementia, with carers' newfound understanding resulting in some changes in care practice that promoted empowerment and independence for people living with dementia. There was also some evidence to suggest that IPSAF had an impact on the wider family, with participants sharing information about dementia with family members who had not attended the programme.

Data was collected from 90 caregivers of people with frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) recruited from the Frontotemporal Dementia Research Group (Frontier) at Neuroscience Research, Australia. Of this caregiver group, 43 were spousal caregivers and 47 were child caregivers. Caregiver burden and emotional state were evaluated using the short Zarit Burden Interview and the short version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. The Social Network Index was applied to ascertain the social network of the caregiver, while the Intimate Bond Measure was used to evaluate the current quality of the relationship between the caregiver and the person with dementia. The Frontotemporal Dementia Rating Scale was used to assess severity of dementia. Spousal and child caregivers experienced similar levels of burden, depression, anxiety, and stress, regardless of disease severity. Co-resident child caregivers had smaller social networks and greater burden than live-out caregivers. Dementia severity was key in spousal caregiver burden, whereas caregiver depression was most important in child caregiver burden. Child and spousal caregivers of individuals with FTD share similar levels of burden, influenced by different factors. Future interventions need to account for these differences."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kaizik","ForeName":"Cassandra","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neuroscience

the UK) has a pivotal role in the quality of care provided to the residents. Much care in this setting is inadequate, lacks a person-centred focus and neglects the dignity of residents. A combination of factors leads to burnout in nurses working in nursing homes, contributing to poor quality care. Recent reports have indicated that cultures of care need to be addressed through training, improved workforce support and supervision and that improving the quality of care for people with dementia can be achieved by the development of leadership in nursing and clarifying professional values. Addressing burnout through an educational intervention should improve quality of care and nurses' experiences.","The study aimed to explore the training needs of nurses working with people with dementia in nursing homes with a view to developing an educational intervention to reduce nurses' burnout and improve person-centred care.","Four focus groups were conducted with 11 qualified nurses working in nursing homes; data was analysed using thematic analysis.","Four themes emerged through the analysis of the transcripts. Participants reported that their work responsibilities revolved mainly around directing others, day to day care, paper work and supporting family carers. Nurses identified the importance of person-centred ways of being, communication and clinical skills when working in nursing home setting. They expressed their frustrations associated with managing staff levels, responding to behaviour that challenges and lack of time.","The barriers to learning, experience of previous training and gaps in knowledge identified could inform the design of future training and support programmes."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

'Bewilderment' reflected the feelings of the participants from the start of their dementia, and was divided into two main themes (1) 'Awareness of change: What's the problem? and (2) Threats to self: This is not me. The superordinate theme, 'Relationships with others', reflected difficulties with social relationships and comprised two main themes (1) 'Family and friends: Things haven't changed\u2026 but do I say anything wrong?' and (2) Coping with threats to self: Blame others or just avoid them.

Existing health and social care structures rarely meet the needs of YOD patients. Internet-based interventions are a novel format of delivering health-related education, counseling, and support to this vulnerable yet underserved group.","The RHAPSODY (Research to Assess Policies and Strategies for Dementia in the Young) project is a European initiative to improve care for people with YOD by providing an internet-based information and skill-building program for family carers. The e-learning program focuses on managing problem behaviors, dealing with role change, obtaining support, and looking after oneself. It will be evaluated in a pilot study in three countries using a randomized unblinded design with a wait-list control group. Participants will be informal carers of people with dementia in Alzheimer's disease or behavioral-variant Frontotemporal degeneration with an onset before the age of 65 years. The primary outcome will be caregiving self-efficacy after 6 weeks of program use. As secondary outcomes, caregivers' stress and burden, carer health-related quality of life, caring-related knowledge, patient problem behaviors, and user satisfaction will be assessed. Program utilization will be monitored and a health-economic evaluation will also be performed.","The RHAPSODY project will add to the evidence on the potential and limitations of a conveniently accessible, user-friendly, and comprehensive internet-based intervention as an alternative for traditional forms of counseling and support in healthcare, aiming to optimize care and support for people with YOD and their informal

interventions have positive effects on cognitive functioning, activities of daily living, behaviour and mood of people with dementia. Our aim here is to provide an up-to-date overview of research into psychosocial interventions and their impact on psychosocial outcomes. We focused on randomised controlled trials, controlled studies and reviews published between October 2008 and August 2015, since the earlier review. The search of PsychInfo, Medline and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews yielded 61 relevant articles, organised into four themes echoing key phases of the care pathway: Living at home with dementia (five reviews, eight studies), carer interventions (three reviews, four studies), interventions in residential care (16 reviews, 12 studies) and end-of-life care (three reviews, two studies), along with an additional group spanning community and institutional settings (six reviews, two studies). Community findings suggested that appointment of dementia specialists and attention to case management can produce positive outcomes; physical therapies, cognitive training and modified cognitive behaviour therapy also had a range of benefits. There was more limited evidence of positive benefits for people with dementia through interventions with family carers. Thirty-two articles focused on the management of 'behavioural symptoms' through a range of interventions all of which had some evidence of benefit. Also a range of multi-component and specific interventions had benefits for cognitive, emotional and behavioural well-being of people with dementia in residential settings, as well as for quality of life. Overall, interventions tended to be short term with impact only measured in the short term. We recommend further research on interventions to promote living well in the community post-diagnosis and to address end-of-life care. Development of psychosocial interventions would benefit from moving beyond the focus on control of behaviours to focus on wider aspects of life for people with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan R","Initials":"JR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parveen","ForeName":"Sahdia","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"07","Day":"04"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Home Care Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Rehabilitation","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychosocial Support Systems"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities"},{"DescriptorName":"Terminal Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","non-pharmacological","psycho-social","randomised controlled trials","review"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"7","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"7","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27380931","1471301216656096","10.1177\/1471301216656096"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27288459","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"23"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Ethical implications of the perception and portrayal of dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"596-608"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301216654036","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The way we perceive and portray dementia has implications for how we act towards people with dementia and how we address the issue of dementia within society.

Leventhal's Model of Self-Regulation suggests perceptions of illness facilitate help-seeking behaviours such as the use of services. This scoping exercise makes use of the model to explore perceptions of dementia in British Indian, African and Caribbean, and East and Central European communities in the United Kingdom. Between August 2013 and April 2014, culturally specific dementia awareness roadshows were attended by people living with dementia, carers and members of the public. During the roadshows, 62 British Indian, 50 African and Caribbean, and 63 East and Central European attenders participated in discussion groups and a dementia knowledge quiz. Thematic and framework analysis were conducted on the discussion group data. Three main themes are presented: Perceptions of dementia, awareness of dementia in the wider family and community, and awareness and use of services. The findings suggest that although groups attributed a biological basis for memory loss, a number of misconceptions prevailed regarding the cause of dementia. Groups also made use of religion, as opposed to medical healthcare services, as a form of personal and treatment control. Seeking help from healthcare services was hindered by lack of awareness of services, and culturally specific barriers such as language. The findings have a number of implications for policy and practice including the development of public health interventions and the need to focus further on reducing barriers to accessing services.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parveen","ForeName":"Sahdia","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Peltier","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bradford and District Older People's Alliance (BOPA), Age UK, Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan R","Initials":"JR","Identifier":"0000-0002-0263-8740","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Ethnic Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Minority Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Work"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["\nBME\n","Alzheimer's disease","carer","ethnic","illness perceptions","support"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2016","Month":"04","Day":"29"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27278859","10.1111\/hsc.12363"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25684278","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"28"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1365-2524","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Health & social care in the community","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Soc Care Community"},"ArticleTitle":"Consensus views on advance care planning for dementia: a Delphi study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"165-74"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/hsc.12191","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The uptake of advance care planning (ACP) is particularly low among people with dementia. This may reflect barriers to communication between professionals, patients and families in the face of lack of consensus about the process. This study aimed to methodically investigate consensus views of how ACP should be explained and carried out with people with dementia. A three-round Delphi study explored views of how and when ACP should be addressed, what should be covered, who should be involved and why rates of ACP are low. Seventeen participants took part comprising family members, old age psychiatrists and policy makers. Thirty-two items reached consensus. The panel agreed on 11 different areas for discussion. They concurred that ACP was best addressed after the person has come to terms with the diagnosis when the individual feels ready to do so. There was a consensus view that the process should be couched in terms of 'certain possibilities'. Consensus items emphasised personal choice and autonomy, while also prioritising the need to discuss financial aspects and to include spouses. There was no consensus that professionals should be involved, although the panel viewed them as carrying some responsibility for low uptake. It is suggested that ACP should include general discussion of values as well as coverage of specific points. Professionals need to offer discussion and information on ACP, but also make clear that the patient has the right to choose whether to pursue ACP or not.

Second, 11 couples, where one partner had a dementia, were recruited and videotaped cooperating on an everyday task. The system was applied to the care-giving spouse's behaviors, labeling examples of behavior as person-centered or non-person-centered.

The project had two phases. Phase one involved adapting an existing competency framework and developing the BPTI using focus groups. For the pilot and evaluation, in phase two, a mixed methods approach was adopted using self-administered standardised questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Qualitative analysis suggested that delivering skills-based training can develop communication, problem-solving and self-directed learning skills; benefit staff in terms of increased knowledge, skills and confidence; and be problematic in the clinical area in terms of time, organisation and the physical environment. These factors must be taken into consideration when delivering training. These changes were not reflected in the quantitative results and measures were not always sensitive to changes in this setting. Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn about the efficacy of the intervention, due to the contradictory outcomes between the quantitative and qualitative data. Further developments and research are required to explore how staff and organisations can be supported to deliver the best possible care.

Dementia costs the UK 17 billion a year and in the next 30 years this will treble to over \u00a350 billion a year. There is a need to raise competence of staff delivering care to people living with dementia across health, social and voluntary sector provision. Effective education and training will build capacity and improve staff knowledge. However, at present not enough is known about the experiences of staff involved in gaining the skills, knowledge and attitudes required to support provision of high quality care for people with dementia. This study was conducted within a large National Health Service Trust in the UK serving an urban, ethnically mixed population, in collaboration with a local university. The trust responded to government policy by seeking to identify staff training needs. The aim was to explore the experiences of staff working within a specialist mental health service in relation to development of skills for the provision of person-centred care for people with dementia. To achieve this, staff roles, experiences of dementia training and the ways in which staff feel they learn were explored through focus group interviews. Relatives' views of staff competencies necessary for effective care provision were also explored to supplement the data from staff. A total of 70 staff and 16 family carers participated and data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis. Five themes emerged: competency-based skills, beliefs, enablers and barriers and ways of learning. Findings suggested participants felt that skills for person-centred care were innate and could not be taught, while effective ways of learning were identified as learning by doing, learning from each other and learning from experience.

Increasingly, there has been interest in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as they are both common and associated with a range of negative outcomes. BPSD are associated with the admission of people with dementia to care homes. Limited resources and lack of knowledge in permanent care settings often lead to BPSD being managed with antipsychotic medications, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is evidence for the benefits of exercise within care home settings, although only a few studies include those with cognitive impairment. Tai Chi is a mind-body exercise combining relaxed physical movement and meditation, and has been suggested to have many health benefits. This article discusses the rationale and available options for treating BPSD and the current practice and reviews the literature regarding the benefits of exercise and, in particular, Tai Chi in the management of BPSD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tadros","ForeName":"George","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Birmingham & Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ormerod","ForeName":"Sara","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dobson-Smyth","ForeName":"Penny","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gallon","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Doherty","ForeName":"Donna","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carryer","ForeName":"Angela","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kingston","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"20"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"rehabilitation"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Qigong"},{"DescriptorName":"Tai Ji"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["BPSD","Tai Chi","behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia","dementia","exercise"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"6","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24336773","1471301211422769","10.1177\/1471301211422769"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23710796","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"10","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"14","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"May","Day":"27"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"Goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation in early-stage dementia: study protocol for a multi-centre single-blind randomised controlled trial (GREAT).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"152"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1745-6215-14-152","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Preliminary evidence suggests that goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation (CR) may be a clinically effective intervention for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, vascular or mixed dementia and their carers.

of someone with dementia differ in terms of whether they perceive their relationship with that person as continuous with the premorbid relationship or as radically different, and that a perception of

The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a quantitative measure of the extent to which spousal carers perceive the relationship to be continuous.","An initial pool of 42 questionnaire items was generated on the basis of the qualitative research about relationship continuity. These were completed by 51 spousal carers and item analysis was used to reduce the pool to 23 items. The retained items, comprising five subscales, were then administered to a second sample of 84 spousal carers, and the questionnaire's reliability, discriminative power, and validity were evaluated.","The questionnaire showed good reliability: Cronbach's \u03b1 for the full scale was 0.947, and test-retest reliability was 0.932. Ferguson's \u03b4 was 0.987, indicating good discriminative power.

We interviewed 6 participants and carried out interpretative phenomenological analysis. We report on 11 themes that reflect distinctive challenges. Five themes relate to witnessing bizarre and strange changes: changed appetites and drives, loss of planning ability, loss of inhibition leading to social embarrassment, risky behavior, and communication problems. Four relate to managing these changes and two to the impact on the person and his or her relationships. Relatives must live with unusual changes in the person with fvFTD and the stigma this carries in social settings. They learn to act assertively for their relatives and put effort into promoting quality of life, using strategies adapted for fvFTD.

Tests to detect suboptimal effort are becoming widely used in clinical practice and are based on their reported insensitivity to cognitive dysfunction. A diagnosis of dementia has life-changing implications for an individual of working age. It is therefore crucial that clinicians can be confident they have obtained a valid estimate of current cognitive functioning. This study aimed to establish whether mood or cognitive functioning adversely influenced performance on symptom validity tests (SVTs) in individuals with working age dementia, who were judged to be using full effort.","Forty-two participants with dementia diagnosed before the age of 65 completed measures of emotional and cognitive functioning and six SVTs.","There were no significant correlations between emotional functioning and measures of effort. However, cognitive functioning, in particular new learning, was significantly related to SVT performance. Participants with mild dementia performed significantly better on all six SVTs than those with moderate\/severe dementia. The results also suggest that the SVTs are not equally sensitive to cognitive dysfunction. Rey's Dot Counting Test (DCT) (times criterion) achieved 100% specificity, and was the only test passed by every participant.","Rey's DCT is the only SVT that can be recommended for use in those under 65 years with possible dementia at this time until further validation studies are undertaken."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rudman","ForeName":"Natalie","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"South Birmingham Primary Care Trust, Moseley Hall Hospital, Birmingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan R","Initials":"JR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Chris A","Initials":"CA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bentham","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Validation Study"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Regression Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"10","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"10","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"4","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20924821","927606053","10.1080\/13607863.2010.508770"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"20695347","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"08","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2010","Month":"08","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0954-7762","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"106","Issue":"25","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2010 Jun 29-Jul 5"}},"Title":"Nursing times","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Times"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia care. 2: Exploring how nursing staff manage challenging behaviour.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"20-2"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This second in a three part series on dementia care explores different approaches to care; part 1 examined communication issues.
