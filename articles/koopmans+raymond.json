The intervention consisted of an educational program and a multidisciplinary care program and was implemented in 13 nursing homes from September 2015 to March 2017. Costs' outcomes included the time investment of the elderly care physician and health care psychologists regarding the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, residents' psychotropic drug use, nursing staff absenteeism, and costs of the educational program. Composite cost measure contained the sum of costs of staff absenteeism, costs on psychotropic drugs, and costs of the educational program. Costs of time investment were investigated by comparing means. Costs of psychotropic drug use were analyzed with mixed models at resident level and as part of the composite cost measure on unit level. Staff absenteeism was also analyzed at unit level.","Compared with care as usual, the mean costs of time invested decreased with \u20ac36.79 for the elderly care physician but increased with \u20ac46.05 for the health care psychologist in the intervention condition. Mixed model analysis showed no effect of the intervention compared with care as usual on the costs of psychotropic drug use, staff absenteeism, and the composite cost measure. The costs of the educational program were on average \u20ac174.13 per resident.","The intervention did not result in increased costs compared with care as usual. Other aspects, such as the lack of a structured working method, should be taken into account when considering implementation of the intervention."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Despite the suggestion that younger people with dementia and their family might have distinct needs and preferences in this area, studies on advance care planning in young-onset dementia are absent.","We aim to explore (1) whether family caregivers had already engaged in advance care planning with patients and\/ or professionals and the accompanying reasons and (2) family caregivers' preferences for how to ideally engage in the process with patients, family and professionals.","A qualitative study was conducted: we analysed semi-structured interviews (\u2009=\u200915) through the method of constant comparative analysis.","We included Flemish family caregivers of persons with young-onset dementia.","Plans for the future typically concerned non-medical affairs. Participants' limited engagement in advance care planning was clarified through several reasons: not considering it useful, hindering patient behaviour, adopting a day-to-day attitude, caregivers emotionally protecting themselves and uncertainty about patients' cognitive competence. However, endorsement for advance care planning showed from respondents' preferences that it should be initiated timely, by a third party, and emphasize patients' remaining capacities. Finally, the need for information and high-quality care emerged.","A gap of knowledge, of information and in care intertwiningly hinder advance care planning. In young-onset dementia, engaging in advance care planning is not an option equally accessible as not doing so.

Thus far, studies on psychotropic drug use (PDU) mainly focused on elderly patients with dementia. It is important to know the prevalence and correlates of PDU in patients with young-onset dementia (YOD) to optimize NPS treatment and reduce excess PDU in this group.","The Behavior and Evolution in Young-Onset Dementia (BEYOnD) study is a cross-sectional study in 230 residents with YOD in eight nursing homes providing specialized YOD care. PDU was registered from medical charts. The influence of age, gender, severity, and type of dementia, NPS, and agitation on PDU was analyzed.","Eighty-seven percent of the residents used psychotropic drugs, and 47% used two or more psychotropic drugs. No significant associations with age, gender, dementia subtype, and dementia severity were found. Depressive symptoms showed an association with the use of antidepressants, nighttime behavior with use of hypnotics, and verbal agitation with antipsychotics. Apathy was strongly associated with lower PDU.","Nursing home patients with YOD have a high prevalence of PDU. The association with NPS raises questions of efficacy of these drugs in managing NPS. Patients with apathy had a lower chance of using psychotropics. More research on indications and effects of psychotropic drugs is needed, as well as on (nonpharmacological) alternatives for managing challenging behavior in YOD."]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["long-term care","nursing home","psychotropic drug use","young-onset

life-expectancy in people with young-onset dementia (YOD) and to examine the relationship with age, sex, dementia subtype and comorbidity.","Survival was examined in 198 participants in the Needs in Young-onset Dementia study, including participants with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).","The primary outcomes were survival time after symptom onset and after date of diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between survival and age, sex, dementia subtype and comorbidity. Additionally, the impact on remaining life expectancy was explored.","During the six-year follow-up, 77 of the participants died (38.9%), 78 participants survived (39.4%) and 43 were lost to follow-up (21.7%). The mean survival time after symptom onset and diagnosis was 209 months (95% CI 185-233) and 120 months (95% CI 110-130) respectively. Participants with AD had a statistically significant shorter survival compared with VaD participants, both regarding survival after symptom onset (p = 0.047) as well as regarding survival after diagnosis (p = 0.049). Younger age at symptom onset or at diagnosis was associated with longer survival times. The remaining life expectancy, after diagnosis, was reduced with 51% for males and 59% for females compared to the life expectancy of the general population in the same age groups.","It is important to consider the dementia subtype when persons with YOD and their families are informed about the prognosis of survival. Our study suggests longer survival times compared to other studies on YOD, and survival is prolonged compared to studies on LOD. Younger age at symptom onset or at diagnosis was positively related to survival but diagnosis at younger ages, nevertheless, still diminishes life expectancy dramatically."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gerritsen","ForeName":"Adrie A

The SIB-S was administered at 6-month intervals during a 2-year period. Dementia severity at baseline was classified according to Global Deterioration Scale criteria.

Between persons with moderate and moderately severe dementia, there was only a difference in the rate of decline of semantic items, but not episodic and non-semantic items.","Although modest floor and slight ceiling effects were noted in severe and milder cases, respectively, the SIB-S proved to be one of few available adequate measures of cognitive change in institutionalized persons with moderate to severe dementia.

This feasibility study had 2 aims: (1) to investigate possible effects regarding VFH, caregiver self-efficacy and the burden experienced, and the frequency of challenging behavior in persons with dementia, and (2) to perform a process evaluation of barriers and facilitators regarding the use of VFH. The respondents were caregivers of home-dwelling persons with dementia participating in VHF (N = 10), a group of caregivers who declined participating in VFH (N = 18), stakeholders (N = 6), and field experts (N = 55). The assessments performed were Positive and Negative Affect Scales, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Sense of Competence Scale, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires. Results demonstrated that caregivers were satisfied with VFH and that various (sub)scores on questionnaires improved. Caregivers mentioned a reluctance toward being filmed and both caregivers and referrers were unfamiliar with VFH. Recommendations have been made for health-care professionals and researchers to overcome these barriers."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gerritsen","ForeName":"Debby

future medical treatment and care with family and healthcare providers, and to record these goals and preferences if appropriate. Because general practitioners (GPs) often have long-lasting relationships with people with dementia, GPs seem most suited to initiate ACP. However, ACP with people with dementia in primary care is uncommon. Although several barriers and facilitators to ACP with people with dementia have already been identified in earlier research, evidence gaps still exist. We therefore aimed to further explore barriers and facilitators for ACP with community-dwelling people with dementia.","A qualitative design, involving all stakeholders in the care for community-dwelling people with dementia, was used. We conducted semi-structured interviews with community dwelling people with dementia and their family caregivers, semi structured interviews by telephone with GPs and a focus group meeting with practice nurses and case managers. Content analysis was used to define codes, categories and themes.","Ten face to face interviews, 10 interviews by telephone and one focus group interview were conducted. From this data, three themes were derived: development of a trust-based relationship, characteristics of an ACP conversation and the primary care setting. ACP is facilitated by a therapeutic relationship between the person with dementia\/family caregiver and the GP built on trust, preferably in the context of home visits. Addressing not only medical but also non-medical issues soon after the dementia diagnosis is given is an important facilitator during conversation. Key barriers were: the wish of some participants to postpone ACP until problems arise, GPs' time restraints, concerns about the documentation of ACP outcomes and concerns about the availability of these outcomes to other healthcare providers.","ACP is facilitated by an open relationship based on trust between the GP, the person with dementia and his\/her family caregiver, in which both medical and non-medical issues are addressed. GPs' availability and time restraints are barriers to ACP. Transferring ACP tasks to case managers or practice nurses may contribute to overcoming these barriers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tilburgs","ForeName":"Bram","Initials":"B","Identifier":"0000-0003-1588-004X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of IQ healthcare, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Important barriers were: uncertainty about the timing of ACP, how to plan for an uncertain future, lack of knowledge about dementia, difficulties assessing people with dementia's decisional capacities, and changing preferences. Facilitators for ACP were: an early start when cognitive decline is still mild, inclusion of all stakeholders, and discussing social and medical issues aimed at maintaining normal life.","Discussing future care is difficult due to uncertainties about the future and the decisional capacities of people with dementia.

Data were used from the Behavior and Evolution of Young-ONset Dementia studies (BEYOND) Parts I and II and the WAAL Behavior in Dementia-II (Waalbed-II) study.","A total of 382 nursing home residents with YOD and 261 nursing home residents with LOD were included.","The Neuropsychiatric Inventory, nursing home version, was used to assess nursing staff distress and the frequency (F) and severity (S) of NPS. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationships between nursing staff distress related to NPS and YOD and LOD care units, the F\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0S score per symptom, gender, dementia subtype, and dementia severity.","Nurses working in YOD care units rated sleep and nighttime behavior disorders, delusions, and agitation\/aggression most often as highly distressing and euphoria most often as not distressing. Multivariate analyses indicated that the frequency and severity of NPS were significantly associated with staff distress in all symptoms, except for apathy. Comparison of the 2 groups of nurses demonstrated that the odds for distress related to sleep and nighttime behavior disorders were higher for nurses in YOD care units than for nurses in LOD units. For both the YOD and LOD nurses, irritability in male residents had higher impact than similar behavior in female residents.","This study provides important insight into distress related to individual NPS and the interaction with residents' characteristics. All NPS result in distress. The frequency and severity of the behavior is an important predictor. Sleep and nighttime behavior disorders are more likely to result in distress in YOD nurses than in LOD nurses. The amount of distress related to NPS emphasizes the urgent need for adequate management of NPS and the support of professional caregivers."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

This index assesses information from medical records on indication, evaluation, dosage, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, duplications, and therapy duration. Various measurements were carried out to identify the possible patient and non-patient factors. Linear multilevel regression analysis was used to identify factors that are associated with APID index sum scores. Analyses were performed for groups of PDs separately, i.e. antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.","The sample consisted of 338 patients with a PD prescription that used 147 antipsychotics, 167 antidepressants, 85 anxiolytics, and 76 hypnotics. It was found that older patients and more severe aggression, agitation, apathy, and depression were associated with more appropriate prescriptions. Additionally, less appropriate prescriptions were found to be associated with more severe anxiety, dementia diagnoses other than Alzheimer dementia, more physician time available per patient, more patients per physician, more years of experience of the physician, and higher nurse's workload.","The association of more pronounced NPS with more appropriate PD prescriptions implies that physicians should pay more attention to the appropriateness of PD prescriptions when NPS are less manifest.

Several factors seemed more apparent in the caregivers who experienced few unmet needs opposed to the caregivers who experienced more unmet needs.","The current study provides an in-depth perspective on the caregiver's experiences and emphasizes specific themes that could be addressed in future interventions. This might contribute to a caring situation in which the caregiver experiences less unmet needs.

dementia, frontotemporal dementia, other) regarding these determinants, and (3) compare QoL profiles of YOD nursing home residents across dementia subtypes.","This cross-sectional study included 207 nursing home residents. Multilevel modeling was used to determine the relationships between QoL and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), dementia severity, psychotropic drug use (PDU), dementia subtype, age, and gender. Additional multilevel models were used to compare aspects of QoL between dementia subtypes.","Residents' QoL was negatively associated with advanced dementia, PDU, and NPS. In general, the relationships between the determinants and QoL were similar across the dementia subtypes. Aspects of QoL differed by dementia subtype. Residents with frontotemporal dementia showed less negative emotions, accepted more help and experienced better quality of relationships with professional caregivers, had a more positive self-image, felt more comfortable in the nursing home environment, and experienced lower quality of social relationships.","Considering the high rates of NPS and PDU in YOD residents and their negative associations with QoL, we recommend emphasizing services to manage and reduce NPS and PDU in nursing home residents with YOD. Furthermore, our findings suggest accounting for differences in aspects of QoL by dementia subtype to address specific needs and thereby improve QoL."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

We sought to assess the effectiveness of a practice guideline for optimal symptom relief for nursing home residents with dementia and pneumonia.","A single-blind, multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32 Dutch nursing homes. Outcomes were assessed on the patient level. The main outcome measures were discomfort and symptoms: discomfort (DS-DAT: Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type), (lack of) comfort (EOLD-CAD: End Of Life in Dementia-Comfort Assessment in Dying), pain (PAINAD: Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia), and respiratory distress (RDOS: Respiratory Distress Observation Scale). Outcomes were scheduled daily from diagnosis until 10\u00a0days later and a final time between 13-15 days from diagnosis by trained observers who were blinded to the intervention and the residents' condition and treatment. In a pre-intervention phase, usual care was provided to all homes. In the intervention phase, matched clusters of homes were randomized to either the control (n\u2009=\u200916) or intervention condition (n\u2009=\u200916).","Between 1 January 2012 and 1 May 2015, 464 episodes of pneumonia were included. Outcomes were obtained for 399 episodes in 367 residents. Longitudinal multilevel linear regression analyses were performed on log-transformed outcomes, so coefficients should be interpreted as a ratio, and a coefficient of 1 means no difference. The practice guideline in the intervention phase did not reduce the level of discomfort and symptoms: DS-DAT: 1.11 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93-1.31), EOLD-CAD: 1.01 (95\u00a0% CI 0.98-1.05), PAINAD: 1.04 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93-1.15), RDOS: 1.11 (95\u00a0% CI 0.90-1.24). However, in both the intervention and control groups, lack of comfort and respiratory distress gradually decreased during the entire 3.5\u00a0years of data collection, and were lower in the intervention phase compared to the pre-intervention phase: DS-DAT: 0.93 (95\u00a0% CI 0.85-1.01), EOLD-CAD: 0.98 (95\u00a0% CI 0.97-1.00), PAINAD: 0.96 (95\u00a0% CI 0.91-1.01), RDOS: 0.92 (95\u00a0% CI 0.87-0.98).","When compared to usual care, the practice guideline for optimal symptom relief did not relieve discomfort and symptoms in nursing home residents with dementia and pneumonia. However, discomfort and symptoms decreased gradually throughout the data collection in both the intervention homes and the control homes. An intervention that focuses on creating awareness may be more effective than a physician practice guideline.","The Netherlands National Trial Register (ID number NTR5071 .

delivered using researcher's observations, and dose received was addressed in a question \"use of the practice guideline,\" which the physicians completed for each patient included in the study. Perceived barriers were assessed with a structured questionnaire (response 69%) and semi-structured interviews (n\u2009=\u200914), which were subject to qualitative content analysis.","Of the 55 physicians involved in the intervention phase, 87% attended an implementation meeting; 20 physicians joined the study later (reach). The intervention was implemented as planned, and all intervention components were delivered by the researchers (fidelity and dose delivered). Thirty-six physicians included 109 patients. For 81% of the patients, the treating physician stated to have used the guideline (dose received). The guideline was perceived as providing a good overview of current practice, but some physicians had expected a more directive protocol or algorithm. Further, recommended regular observations of symptoms were rarely performed. Physician's often felt that \"this is not different from what we usually do,\" and with the acute illness, there was not always enough time to (re)familiarize with the contents.","The physicians used the practice guideline frequently despite important barriers. Future implementation may involve strategies such as multiple interactive meetings. Further, the greatest potential to alter usual practice should be emphasized, such as using observational instruments.

The influence of gender, dementia severity, type of dementia, and disease awareness on clusters of relevant NPS was investigated using multivariate logistic regression analysis and subsequently corrected for the possible confounders of age, duration of institutionalization, and psychoactive medication use.","Ninety percent of the nursing home residents with YOD showed 1 or more neuropsychiatric symptoms, 88% showed significant agitation, and 56% showed relevant apathy. No gender differences were found. Although physically aggressive behavior, non-physically aggressive behavior, and apathy were more common in patients with (very) severe cognitive decline (Global Deterioration Scale [GDS] stage 6-7), verbally agitated behavior was common in patients in all except the most severe stages of dementia (GDS 2-6). Apathy was more prevalent in alcohol-related dementia. Low levels of awareness were associated with more physically aggressive behavior and aberrant motor behavior.","The prevalence of NPS was high and was associated with the severity and type of dementia and disease awareness. Agitation and apathy are the most important symptoms to focus on in YOD. The high prevalence of NPS supports the idea of care delivery in special care units.

Although comorbidity in patients with late-onset AD (LO-AD) is common, for people with young-onset AD (YO-AD), it is unclear how often comorbidity occurs. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether comorbidity in patients with YO-AD differs from that in patients with LO-AD. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, types of morbidity, and morbidity profiles in patients with YO-AD compared with those of patients with LO-AD.","Explorative cohort study from 2 separate Dutch cohorts (Needs in Young-onset Dementia [NeedYD] and the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity-Dementia Study [4C-Dementia study]).","Participants were recruited in 2007 and 2008 from (1) the memory clinics of 3 Dutch Alzheimer centers, (2) the memory clinics of general hospitals, (3) mental health services in the southern part of the Netherlands, and (4) young-onset dementia specialized day care facilities. A comparison group of community-dwelling, elderly patients with AD was selected from the 4C-Dementia study. Patients in this study were recruited in 2010 and 2011 from the aforementioned Alzheimer centers.","The prevalence rates of comorbidity were compared between 177 patients with YO-AD and 155 patients with LO-AD. Comorbidity was classified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The total amount of comorbidity was established by counting the number of existing diseases (ICD categories or chapters) and comorbidity was also dichotomized as present or absent. Furthermore, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to study clusters of comorbidity.","Compared with LO-AD, patients with YO-AD showed less (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) overall comorbidity (58.2% vs 86.5%) and had lower prevalence rates of diabetes, obesity, and circulatory diseases; however, the prevalence rates of diseases of the nervous system in YO-AD (6.2%) were higher compared with those of patients with LO-AD (4.5%). The cluster analysis revealed a distinctive group of patients with YO-AD with either no comorbidity or with a disease of the nervous system. Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and diseases of the circulatory system were present in 34% of the patients with YO-AD.","Comorbidity is less common in YO-AD than in LO-AD. However, general practitioners should be aware that approximately one-third of the patients with YO-AD suffer from or have endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and\/or diseases of the circulatory system. Treatment should therefore not only focus on dementia but also on comorbidity. This attention may slow the functional decline in AD. These exploratory analyses suggested a higher prevalence of nervous system diseases in YO-AD compared with LO-AD. However, the finding did not reach statistical significance and in combination with the exploratory nature of the analyses justifies further investigation. If verified, this finding may help to decrease the time to diagnosis of AD and, subsequently, support in young patients with a neurological disease. Further investigation is needed to gain more insight into the association between comorbidity and AD in younger people."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Recommendations, such as those of the EAPC have been proposed to strengthen the provision of palliative care for this group of patients. Yet, it remains challenging for professionals to identify when a person with dementia is in need of palliative care. The objective of this study therefore was to explore when professionals in long-term care settings consider a person with dementia in need of palliative care.","Teams with in total 84 professionals working in 13 long-term care settings from 6 countries (France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland and the Netherlands) received a case-vignette concerning a person with dementia recently admitted to a nursing home. Teams were asked to discuss when they considered people with dementia eligible for palliative care. The constant comparative method was used to analyse their answers.","Three different time points in the disease trajectory when people with dementia were considered to be eligible for palliative care were extracted: (1) early in the disease trajectory; (2) when signs and symptoms of advanced dementia are present; and (3) from the time point that curative treatment of co-morbidities is futile. Yet, none of these time points was uniformly considered by the professional teams across Europe. In some cases, professionals working in the same nursing home didn't even reach consensus when considering persons with dementia eligible for palliative care.","The results of the study identified that professionals across Europe have different opinions regarding the time point when to consider a person with dementia in need of palliative care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Riet Paap","ForeName":"Jasper","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ healthcare), Radboud university medical center, P.O.

On behalf of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC), we recently performed a Delphi study to define domains for palliative care in dementia and to provide recommendations for optimal care. An international panel of experts in palliative care, dementia care or both, achieved consensus on almost all domains and recommendations, but the domain concerning the applicability of palliative care to dementia required revision.","To examine in detail, the opinions of the international panel of 64 experts around the applicability of palliative care, we explored feedback they provided in the Delphi process. To examine which experts found it less important or less applicable, ordinal regression analyses related characteristics of the panelists to ratings of overall importance of the applicability domain, and to agreement with the domain's four recommendations.","Some experts expressed concerns about bringing up end-of-life issues prematurely and about relabeling dementia care as palliative care. Multivariable analyses with the two outcomes of importance and agreement with applicability indicated that younger or less experienced experts and those whose expertise was predominantly in dementia care found palliative care in dementia less important and less applicable.","Benefits of palliative care in dementia are acknowledged by experts worldwide, but there is some controversy around its early introduction. Further studies should weigh concerns expressed around care receiving a \"palliative\" label versus the benefits of applying palliative care early."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der Steen","ForeName":"Jenny T","Initials":"JT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Center,Van der Boechorststraat 7,1081BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Radbruch","ForeName":"Lukas","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Palliative Medicine,University Hospital Bonn,Bonn,Germany; andPalliative Care Centre,Malteser Hospital Bonn\/Rhein-Sieg,Von-Hompesch-Str. 1,53123 Bonn,Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Boer","ForeName":"Marike E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Center,Van der Boechorststraat 7,1081BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"J\u00fcnger","ForeName":"Saskia","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of General Medicine,Hannover Medical School,Carl-Neuberg-Stra\u00dfe 1,30625 Hannover,Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hughes","ForeName":"Julian C","Initials":"JC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust,North Tyneside General Hospital,Rake Lane,North Shields,Tyne and Wear,NE29 8NH and Policy,Ethics and Life Science (PEALS) Research Centre,Newcastle University,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Larkin","ForeName":"Phil","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"UCD School of Nursing,Midwifery and Health Systems and Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services,UCD College of Health Sciences,Belfield,Dublin 4,Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gove","ForeName":"Dianne","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Europe,14 rue Dicks,1417 Luxembourg,Luxembourg."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Francke","ForeName":"Anneke L","Initials":"AL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine,EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Center,Van der Boechorststraat 7,1081BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C M","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Radboud University Medical Center,Department of Primary and Community Care,P.O.

Second, inadequate knowledge of and experience with NPS and limited people skills of nurses may induce PD prescription. Also, knowledge of effectiveness and side effects of PDs from education, literature, and guidelines, and previous personal experiences was considered relevant. Third, effective communication and cooperation between professionals and with family may improve the appropriateness of PD prescription.

Delusions\/delusional misidentification, wandering\/agitation, aberrant motor behavior\/motor hyperactivity and apathy are the most common NPS. For hallucinations, delusions\/delusional misidentification, paranoia, aggression, wandering\/agitation, aberrant motor behavior\/motor hyperactivity, disinhibition, apathy, and sleep disturbance increasing trends in point prevalence rates have been found.","NPS in community-dwelling patients are frequent and persistent.

structured and consensus-based approach to relieve symptoms of pneumonia in patients with dementia in nursing homes.","A five-round Delphi study involving a panel consisting of 24 experts was conducted. An initial version of the practice guideline was developed with leading representatives of Dutch University Medical Centers with a department for elderly care medicine, based on existing guidelines for palliative care. The experts evaluated the initial version, after which we identified topics that reflected the main divergences. The experts rated their agreement with statements that addressed the main divergences on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was determined according to pre-defined criteria. The practice guideline was then revised according to the final decisions made by the project group and the representatives.","The response rate for the expert panel was 67%. Main divergences included the applicability of guidelines for palliative care to patients with dementia and pneumonia in long-term care and the appropriateness of specific pharmacological treatment of dyspnea and coughing. Moderate consensus was reached for 80% of the statements. Major revisions included adding pharmacological treatment for coughing and recommending opioid rotation in the case of opioid-induced delirium. Two areas of divergent opinion remained: the usefulness of oxygen administration and treatment of rattling breath.

To date, prospective studies on the course of NPS have been conducted in patients with dementia in clinical centers or psychiatric services. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the course of NPS in patients with dementia and caregiver distress in primary care. We also aim to detect determinants of both the course of NPS in patients with dementia and informal caregiver distress in primary care.","This is a prospective observational study on the course of NPS in patients with dementia in primary care. Thirty-seven general practitioners (GPs) in 18 general practices were selected based on their interest in participating in this study. We will retrieve electronic medical files of patients with dementia from these general practices. Patients and caregivers will be followed for 18 months during the period January 2012 to December 2013. Patient characteristics will be collected at baseline. Time to death or institutionalization will be measured. Co-morbidity will be assessed using the Charlson index. Psychotropic drug use and primary and secondary outcome measures will be measured at 3 assessments, baseline, 9 and 18 months. The primary outcome measures are the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score for patients with dementia and the Sense of Competence score for informal caregivers. In addition to descriptive analyses frequency parameters will be computed. Univariate analysis will be performed to identify determinants of the course of NPS and informal caregiver distress. All determinants will then be tested in a multivariate regression analysis to determine their unique contribution to the course of NPS and caregiver distress.","The results of this study will provide data on the course of NPS, which is clinically important for prognosis. The data will help GPs and other professionals in planning follow-up visits and in the timing for offering psycho-education, psychosocial interventions and the provision of care. In addition, these data will enlarge health professionals' awareness of NPS in their patients with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Borsje","ForeName":"Petra","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud university medical centre, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia in nursing homes. Alongside an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial in which we studied the effectiveness of DCM on residents and staff outcomes, we investigated differences in costs of care between DCM and usual care in nursing homes.","Dementia special care units were randomly assigned to DCM or usual care. Nurses from the intervention care homes received DCM training, a DCM organizational briefing day and conducted the 4-months DCM-intervention twice during the study. A single DCM cycle consists of observation, feedback to the staff, and action plans for the residents. We measured costs related to health care consumption, falls and psychotropic drug use at the resident level and absenteeism at the staff level. Data were extracted from resident files and the nursing home records. Prizes were determined using the Dutch manual of health care cost and the cost prices delivered by a pharmacy and a nursing home. Total costs were evaluated by means of linear mixed-effect models for longitudinal data, with the unit as a random effect to correct for dependencies within units.","34 units from 11 nursing homes, including 318 residents and 376 nursing staff members participated in the cost analyses. Analyses showed no difference in total costs. However certain changes within costs could be noticed. The intervention group showed lower costs associated with outpatient hospital appointments over time (p = 0.05) than the control group. In both groups, the number of falls, costs associated with the elderly-care physician and nurse practitioner increased equally during the study (p<0.02).","DCM is a cost-neutral intervention. It effectively reduces outpatient hospital appointments compared to usual care. Other considerations than costs, such as nursing homes' preferences, may determine whether they adopt the DCM method.","Dutch Trials Registry NTR2314."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands ;

The prevalence and type of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in YOD differ from patients with late onset dementia. NPS in dementia patients are often treated with psychotropic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate psychotropic drug use (PDU) in Dutch community-dwelling YOD patients and the association between age, gender, dementia etiology and severity, symptoms of depression, disease awareness, unmet needs, and type of NPS.","Psychotropic drug use in 196 YOD patients was registered. Drugs were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical classification. The association between age, gender, dementia type, dementia stage, type of NPS, depressive symptoms, disease awareness, and amount of unmet needs on total PDU was analyzed using binomial logistic regression analysis.","Fifty-two percent of the patients were prescribed at least one psychotropic drug; 36.2% of patients used one drug, and 12.2% used two different drugs. Antidepressants (36.2%) and antipsychotic drugs (17.3%) were the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs. Anti-dementia drugs were prescribed in 51.5% of the patients. Increasing age and moderate to severe depressive symptoms were positively associated with the total use of psychotropic drugs.","Community-dwelling YOD patients have a high prevalence of PDU. More research is needed to study the association between unmet needs, NPS, and PDU, and psychosocial interventions have to be developed to limit the use of psychotropic drugs in YOD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C

(LTC) facilities. The number of institutionalized patients with PD will rise sharply in the coming decades because of 2 concurrent phenomena: aging of the population leads to an increased PD prevalence and improved quality of care has led to a prolonged survival in advanced disease stages. Only a few studies have investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with PD in LTC facilities. Even fewer studies have addressed the treatment strategies used to support these institutionalized patients, who are mostly in advanced stages of the disease. The available evidence suggests that current management of patients with PD in LTC facilities is less than optimal. In the Netherlands, and we suspect in many other countries, there are no formal guidelines for treating patients with PD who have been admitted to a LTC facility. In this review, we describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and clinical management of patients with PD in LTC settings. We also address potentially modifiable elements of care and provide several recommendations to improve the management of PD in these facilities. We conclude by suggesting a possible guide for future research in this area. ","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 American Medical Directors Association, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These drugs can have many side effects and effectiveness is limited. Psychotropic drug use between nursing home units varies and is not solely related to the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is growing evidence indicating that psychotropic drug use is associated with environmental factors, suggesting that the prescription of psychotropic drugs is not only related to (objective) patient factors. However, other factors related to the patient, elderly care physician, nurse and the physical environment are only partially identified. Using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative research, this study aims to understand the nature of psychotropic drug use and its underlying factors by identifying: 1) frequency and appropriateness of psychotropic drug use for neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia, 2) factors associated with (appropriateness of) psychotropic drug use.","A cross-sectional mixed methods study. For the quantitative study, patients with dementia (n = 540), nursing staff and elderly care physicians of 36 Dementia Special Care Units of 12 nursing homes throughout the Netherlands will be recruited. Six nursing homes with high average rates and six with low average rates of psychotropic drug use, based on a national survey about frequency of psychotropic drug use on units, will be included. Psychotropic drugs include antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and anti-dementia drugs. Appropriateness will be measured by an instrument based on the Medication Appropriateness Index and current guidelines for treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Factors associated to psychotropic drug use, related to the patient, elderly care physician, nurse and physical environment, will be explored using multilevel regression analyses. For the qualitative study, in depth interviews with staff will be held and analyzed to identify and explore other unknown factors.","This study will provide insight into factors that are associated with the frequency and appropriateness of psychotropic drug use for neuropsychiatric symptoms.

parent who has a progressive disease, often assist in caregiving tasks, which may have a great impact on their lives. The objective of the present study is to explore the experiences of children living with a young parent with dementia with a specific focus on the children's needs.","Semi-structured interviews with 14 adolescent children between the ages of 15 and 27 years of patients with YOD were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Themes were identified based on the established codes.","The emerging categories were divided into three themes that demonstrated the impact of dementia on daily life, different ways of coping with the disease, and children's need for care and support. The children had difficulties managing all of the responsibilities and showed concerns about their future. To deal with these problems, they demonstrated various coping styles, such as avoidant or adaptive coping. Although most children were initially reluctant to seek professional care, several of them expressed the need for practical guidance to address the changing behavior of their parent. The children felt more comfortable talking to someone who was familiar with their situation and who had specific knowledge of YOD and the available services.","In addition to practical information, more accessible and specific information about the diagnosis and the course of YOD is needed to provide a better understanding of the disease for the children.

In order to be able to inform daily practice, we studied DCM effectiveness in a pragmatic cRCT involving a wide range of care homes with trained nursing staff carrying out the intervention.","Dementia special care units were randomly assigned to DCM or usual care. Nurses from the intervention care homes received DCM training and conducted the 4-months DCM-intervention twice during the study. The primary outcome was agitation, measured with the Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory (CMAI). The secondary outcomes included residents' neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) and quality of life, and staff stress and job satisfaction. The nursing staff made all measurements at baseline and two follow-ups at 4-month intervals. We used linear mixed-effect models to test treatment and time effects.","34 units from 11 care homes, including 434 residents and 382 nursing staff members, were randomly assigned. Ten nurses from the intervention units completed the basic and advanced DCM training. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant effect on the CMAI (mean difference between groups 2\u00b74, 95% CI -2\u00b77 to 7\u00b76; p\u200a=\u200a0\u00b734). More NPSs were reported in the intervention group than in usual care (p\u200a=\u200a0\u00b702). Intervention staff reported fewer negative and more positive emotional reactions during work (p\u200a=\u200a0\u00b702).

Furthermore, the caregiver's competence in caring for the person with dementia significantly predicted institutionalization in both groups.","Patients with YOD are cared for at home for a longer period than patients with LOD. The results of this study underline the importance of a timely diagnosis for these patients and their families to facilitate the initiation of appropriate care and support. Support programs aimed at enhancing the caregivers' sense of competence and ability to deal with neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially apathy, may postpone the institutionalization of the patient."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013.

Dementia-care mapping is a person-centred care method that may alleviate both the resident and the staff problems. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dementia-care mapping in nursing-home dementia care.","The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial, with nursing homes grouped in clusters. Studywise minimisation is the allocation method. Nursing homes in the intervention group will receive a dementia-care-mapping intervention, while the control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is resident agitation, to be assessed with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. The secondary outcomes are resident neuropsychiatric symptoms, assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory--Nursing Homes and quality of life, assessed with Qualidem and the EQ-5D. The staff outcomes are stress reactions, job satisfaction and job-stress-related absenteeism, and staff turnover rate, assessed with the Questionnaire about Experience and Assessment of Work, the General Health Questionnaire-12, and the Maastricht Job Satisfaction Scale for Health Care, respectively. We will collect the data from the questionnaires and electronic registration systems. We will employ linear mixed-effect models and cost-effectiveness analyses to evaluate the outcomes. We will use structural equation modelling in the secondary analysis to evaluate the plausibility of a theoretical model regarding the effectiveness of the dementia-care mapping intervention. We will set up process analyses, including focus groups with staff, to determine the relevant facilitators of and barriers to implementing dementia-care mapping broadly.","A novelty of dementia-care mapping is that it offers an integral person-centred approach to dementia care in nursing homes. The major strengths of the study design are the large sample size, the cluster-randomisation, and the one-year follow-up. The generalisability of the implementation strategies may be questionable because the motivation for person-centred care in both the intervention and control nursing homes is above average. The results of this study may be useful in improving the quality of care and are relevant for policymakers.","The trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR2314."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2012 van de Ven et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, P.O.

dementia and is not a well-known phenomenon. This study explores the development and risk factors of paratonia in moderate stage dementia patients.","A multi-center, longitudinal, one-year follow-up cohort study was performed. Patients with an established diagnosis of dementia, with a score of 6 or lower on the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were included. The participants were assessed using the Paratonia Assessment Instrument (PAI), the Timed Up and GO test, the Qualidem, the Global Deterioration Scale (Reisberg et al., 1982) and the Mini-mental State Examination. Information about each patient's diagnosis of dementia, comorbidities and use of medication were obtained from the participant's medical file. The PAI was assessed every three months, the other variables at baseline and after 12 months. Cross-tabulation \u03c72 and logistic regression tests were used for the statistical analyses.","Baseline measures were assessed in the 204 participants - 111 (54%) female and 93 (46%) male, with a mean age of 79.8 years (56-97). Seventy-one patients (34.8%) were diagnosed with paratonia at baseline, and 51 patients developed paratonia over one year. The highest hazard ratio (3.1) for developing paratonia within one year was observed in the vascular dementia group. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of diabetes mellitus (OR = 10.7) was significantly related to the development of paratonia (Wald \u03c72 p-value < 0.01).","Diabetes mellitus and likely vascular damage are risk factors for the development of paratonia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hobbelen","ForeName":"Johannes S M","Initials":"JS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dutch Institute of Allied Health Care, Amersfoort, The Netherlands.

Search terms included \"dementia\", \"long-term care institutions\", \"NPS\", \"longitudinal\", and additional related terms. All titles and abstracts were independently assessed for inclusion and for methodological quality by two researchers, and the full texts of relevant papers were retrieved. Inclusion criteria were: dementia diagnosis, long-term care institutions, NPS, and longitudinal design.","The literature search revealed 1982 papers of which 18 met the inclusion criteria. The patients were predominately female and aged 75 years and over. The follow-up period ranged from three months to one year. The number of assessments ranged from two to five, and 12 different assessment instruments were used to study NPS. Aberrant motor behavior, depression, anxiety, and euphoria showed decline over time, and psychosis remained constant whereas apathy, agitation, irritability, and disinhibition increased over time. All symptoms showed specific intermittent courses. The methodological quality of the literature was limited by the small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and lack of comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment instruments.","In the reviewed studies, NPS in institutionalized residents with dementia showed a heterogeneous course, although methodological limitations and the diversity of the studies call for caution in interpretation.

Assessments are performed every six months over two years and consist of interviews and questionnaires with patients and caregivers. The main outcomes are (1) the needs of patients and caregivers, as measured by the Camberwell Assessment of Needs for the Elderly (CANE) and (2) neuropsychiatric symptoms, as measured by the NeuroPsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Qualitative analyses will be performed in order to obtain more in-depth information on the experiences of EOD patients and their family members.

The first group receives PMT, the second group receives usual care without PMT. PMT is given according to a protocol by physical therapist three times a week for four weeks in a row. The severity of paratonia (Modified Ashworth scale), the severity of the dementia (Global Deterioration Scale), the clinical improvement (Clinical Global Impressions), the difficulty in daily care (Patient Specific Complaints) and the experienced pain in daily care of the participant (PACSLAC-D) is assessed by assessors blind to treatment allocation at baseline, after 6 and 12 treatments.

This study systematically reviews the reporting of adverse events of antipsychotics used to treat BPSD in randomised, controlled trials (RCTs).","We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and CINAHL databases (search period 1980 or 1986-April 2005) and the Cochrane controlled trials register (2005) for RCTs that used intention-to-treat analysis to evaluate the efficacy and harms of antipsychotics used to treat BPSD. Two independent reviewers assessed the reporting of adverse events.","Screening of 930 abstracts identified 12 eligible RCTs (2809 patients). Most participants were elderly people (mean age 80 years) with Alzheimer's, vascular or mixed dementia. Studies lasted from 3 to 16 weeks. Adverse events, though common, were described heterogeneously and incompletely. No RCT fulfilled all Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials requirements for the reporting of harms. Atypical antipsychotics caused fewer extrapyramidal symptoms and less somnolence than typical antipsychotics, but these differences disappeared when dosages were increased. Only one trial reported cerebrovascular adverse events, with a number needed to harm of 14 (95% CI 8, 41).","At lower doses atypical antipsychotics may cause fewer adverse events in the treatment of BPSD, but there is uncertainty about their cerebrovascular safety profile. The RCTs included in this systematic review described adverse events too incompletely and heterogeneously to allow generation of clear treatment recommendations, and they do not provide sufficient evidence to support recent safety warnings. Better reporting on harms in RCTs is needed to enable rational treatment decisions with respect to use of antipsychotics for BPSD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Iersel","ForeName":"Marianne B","Initials":"MB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatrics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zuidema","ForeName":"Sytse U","Initials":"SU"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C M","Initials":"RT"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Olde Rikkert","ForeName":"Marcel G M","Initials":"MG"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Drugs Aging","NlmUniqueID":"9102074","ISSNLinking":"1170-229X"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Behavior","QualifierName":"drug effects"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Databases, Bibliographic"},{"DescriptorName":"Databases, Factual"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["drug therapy","etiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"51"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"1","Day":"21","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16245958","22104","10.2165\/00002512-200522100-00004"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2004 Aug;19(8):803-4","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15290706"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2005 Mar;17 (1):4-12;
