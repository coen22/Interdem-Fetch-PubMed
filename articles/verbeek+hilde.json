It is important to have a timely diagnosis during the disease course to reduce the risk of medication errors, enable future care planning for the patient and their relatives thereby optimizing quality of life (QoL). For this reason, it is important to avoid a diagnosis of dementia not otherwise specified (DNOS) and instead obtain a diagnosis that reflects the underlying pathology. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of DNOS in persons with dementia living at home or in a nursing home.","This is a cross-sectional cohort study performed in eight European countries. Persons with dementia aged \u226565\u2009years living at home (n\u2009=\u20091223) or in a nursing home (n\u2009=\u2009790) were included. Data were collected through personal interviews with questionnaires based on standardised instruments. Specific factors investigated were sociodemographic factors, cognitive function, and mental health, physical health, QoL, resource utilization and medication. Bivariate and backward stepwise multivariate regression analyses were performed.","The prevalence of DNOS in the eight participating European countries was 16% (range 1-30%) in persons living at home and 21% (range 1-43%) in persons living in a nursing home. These people are more often older compared to those with a specific dementia diagnosis. In both persons living at home and persons living in a nursing home, DNOS was associated with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and less use of anti-dementia medication. In addition, persons with DNOS living at home had more symptoms of depression and less use of antidepressant medication.","The prevalence of DNOS diagnosis is common and seems to vary between European countries. People with DNOS are more often older with more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and receive fewer anti-dementia medication, anxiolytics and antidepressants. This would support the suggestion that a proper and specific diagnosis of dementia could help the management of their disease."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lethin","ForeName":"Connie","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0002-2523-8440","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine, Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Box 157, 221 00, Lund, Sweden. connie.lethin@med.lu.se."},{"Affiliation":"Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Jan Waldenstr\u00f6ms gata 35, Malm\u00f6, Sweden. connie.lethin@med.lu.se."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rahm Hallberg","ForeName":"Ingalill","Initials":"I","Identifier":"0000-0002-3286-6023","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine, Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Box 157, 221 00, Lund, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Renom Guiteras","ForeName":"Anna","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University Hospital Parc de Salut Mar, Passeig Mar\u00edtim 25-29, 08003, Barcelona, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verbeek","ForeName":"Hilde","Initials":"H","Identifier":"0000-0002-3740-5162","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, P.O.

beneficial for their well-being. It is suggested that innovative types of nursing homes such as small-scale living facilities and green care farms create a better match between their care environment and their residents. However whether this is also reflected into the experiences of informal caregivers is not known. Therefore, this study explores what their positive and negative experiences are with regard to green care farms, other small-scale living facilities, and traditional nursing homes.","A qualitative exploratory research design was used. Semi-structured interviews with 43 informal caregivers (2014-2015) were carried out. Topics discussed were: positive and negative experiences with the nursing home and reasons for choice of a particular type of nursing home. Thematic analysis including an iterative process of open, axial and selective coding, was used.","Five themes emerged: (1) physical environment and atmosphere, (2) activities, (3) person-centred care, (4) communication, and (5) staff. Informal caregivers at green care farms were more positive about the physical environment, activities, and person-centred care compared with informal caregivers in the other types of nursing homes. Both positive and negative experiences regarding communication and individual staff members appeared across all types of nursing homes.","Experiences of informal caregivers with a nursing home are dependent on the type of nursing home. However, experiences were also often related to individual nursing staff and their interpersonal, 'human' qualities."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Boer","ForeName":"Bram","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of

physically more active, have more social interactions, are involved in a larger variety of activities, and come outdoors more often than those in other long-term dementia care settings. These aspects may positively affect health and well-being. This study explored which and how characteristics of GCFs could be implemented in other long-term dementia care settings, taking into account possible facilitators and barriers.","Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 professionals from GCFs, independent small-scale long-term care facilities, and larger scale long-term care facilities in the Netherlands. The framework method was used to analyze the data.","Several characteristics of GCFs (e.g. homelike aspects, domestic activities, and access to outdoor environments) have already been applied in other types of long-term dementia care settings. However, how and the extent to which these characteristics are being applied differ between GCFs and other types of long-term dementia care settings. Facilitators and barriers for the implementation of characteristics of GCFs were related to the physical environment in which the care facility is situated (e.g. the degree of urbanization), characteristics and competences of staff members (e.g. flexibility, creativity), characteristics and competences of managers (e.g. leadership, vision), and the political context (e.g. application of risk and safety protocols).","Several characteristics can be implemented in other dementia care settings.

The green care farm is a new type of nursing home developed in the Netherlands. The goal of this study was to compare quality of care, quality of life and related outcomes in green care farms, regular small-scale living facilities and traditional nursing homes for people with dementia.","A cross-sectional design was used. Three types of nursing homes were included: (1) green care farms; (2) regular small-scale living facilities; (3) traditional nursing homes. All participating nursing homes were non-profit, collectively funded nursing homes in the south of the Netherlands. One hundred and fifteen residents with a formal diagnosis of dementia were included in the study. Data on quality of care was gathered and consisted of outcome indicators (e.g. falling incidents, pressure ulcers), structure indicators (e.g. hours per resident per day), and process indicators (e.g. presence, accessibility and content of protocols on care delivery). Furthermore, questionnaires on cognition, dependence in activities of daily living, quality of life, social engagement, neuropsychiatric symptoms, agitation, and depression were used.","Data showed that quality of care was comparable across settings. No large differences were found on clinical outcome measures, hours per resident per day, or process indicators. Higher quality of life scores were reported for residents of green care farms in comparison with residents of traditional nursing homes. They scored significantly higher on the Quality of Life - Alzheimer's disease Scale (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ES\u00a0=\u00a00.8) indicating a better quality of life. In addition, residents of green care farms scored higher on three quality of life domains of the Qualidem: positive affect, social relations and having something to do (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, ES\u00a0>\u00a00.7). No differences with regular small-scale living facilities were found.","Green care farms seem to be a valuable alternative to existing nursing homes. This is important as people with dementia are a heterogeneous group with varying needs. In order to provide tailored care there also is a need for a variety of living environments."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de

Information about its implications for nursing staff is lacking, and only a few studies have addressed staff perceptions. We sought to explore staff perceptions of required skills and to determine differences in job satisfaction, motivation, and job characteristics of staff working in both care settings.","A secondary data analysis was conducted. The data source used was drawn from a larger study testing the effects of small-scale living (Verbeek et\u00a0al., 2009).","Nursing staff working on a permanent basis and who were directly involved in care were eligible to participate in the study. Data on job satisfaction, motivation, and job characteristics of nursing staff working in typical small-scale and traditional care environments were derived using a questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Differences between nursing staff job satisfaction, motivation, and job characteristics were tested using multilinear regression analysis.","In total, 138 staff members were included (81 staff members working in traditional nursing home wards and 57 staff members working in small-scale nursing home wards). The findings showed that in typical small-scale nursing homes, job satisfaction and job motivation were significantly higher compared to those in typical traditional nursing homes. Job autonomy and social support were also significantly higher, while job demands were significantly lower in these small-scale nursing homes.

At least 16 experts participated in each country (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom).","Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the experts and their placement preferences. Logistic regression modeling was used to explore the extent to which the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of people with dementia, and the profession, workplace, and country of decision-makers were associated with ILTC recommendation.","Client characteristics, decision-maker attributes, and country all seemed to play a part in influencing professionals' perceptions of the appropriateness of ILTC for people with dementia. Expert decision-makers were more likely to recommend ILTC for individuals who required help with mobility or had multiple care needs, and appeared to give more weight to carers' than clients' wishes. Community-based social workers were less likely than other professional groups to favor ILTC placement. Experts in Finland, Germany, and the United Kingdom were less likely to recommend ILTC than experts in France, the Netherlands, and Estonia; experts in Sweden and Spain took an intermediate position.","This study provides new understanding of the factors that shape professionals' perceptions of ILTC appropriateness and highlights the need to construct multifaceted models of institutionalization when planning services for people with dementia. It also has several important clinical implications (including flagging interventions that could decrease the need for ILTC), and provides a basis for enhancing professionals' decision-making capabilities (including the greater involvement of clients themselves)."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

This study investigated which aspects of daily life are related to QoL in dementia.","An observational study was conducted. Daily life was assessed with the tablet-based Maastricht Electronic Daily Life Observation-tool (MEDLO-tool). Aspects included activity, engagement in the activity, social interaction, physical effort, mood, and agitation. QoL was assessed by formal nursing caregivers using the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease scale (QoL-AD). A total of 9,660 momentary assessments were conducted.","The mean age of the 115 participants was 84 years and most (75%) were women. Bivariate analyses showed that residents with a higher QoL carried out less passive\/purposeless activities (25% vs. 38%), were more engaged in active, expressive, and social activities, (40% vs. 27%), had more social interaction (34% vs. 22%), and had better mood scores (scale 1-7, 5.0 vs. 4.8), compared with residents with a lower QoL (all p-values < 0.001).

The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) measured depressive symptomatology. PwD completed measures of cognition and quality of life (QoL), and informal or formal carers completed measures on the PwD' QoL, neuropsychiatric behavior, activities of daily living, comorbidities, pain, and falls. Logistic regression was used to assess which factors contributed to depressive symptomatology in the two settings.","Those receiving home care, living in Germany, and with severe dementia, showed the highest prevalence of depressive symptomatology. In the home care group, high levels of pain, neuropsychiatric behavior, and comorbidity, as well as low self- and proxy-rated QoL were factors associated with depressive symptomatology. In the LTC group, low proxy-rated QoL, more severe neuropsychiatric behavior, being a male informal carer and living in Germany were associated with depressive symptomatology.","Evidence highlights the need for targeting different aspects in the management of depression in dementia, including offering improved pain management for those living in the community.

dementia who have recently been admitted to long-term care facilities.","Many people with dementia will be admitted to long-term care facilities at some point during their disease. It is currently unknown which factors are associated with improvement and\/or deterioration of quality of life immediately following admission.","An observational and longitudinal survey.","Data on 343 people with dementia who have been recently admitted to long-term care facilities across eight European countries were collected between November 2010-April 2012. Quality of life was assessed by people with dementia and their proxies using the 'Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease scale'. Explanatory variables included cognitive status, comorbidities, activities of daily living, depressive symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Descriptive and multilevel regression analyses were performed.","Better cognitive abilities at baseline were associated with a decrease in self-reported quality of life. Greater dependency and more depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with declined proxy-reported quality of life. Furthermore, an increased dependency and an increase of depressive symptoms between baseline and follow-up were associated with a decreased proxy-reported quality of life. On an individual level, three groups were identified, namely people whose quality of life: (1) decreased; (2) stayed the same; and (3) increased.","Cognitive functioning, functional rehabilitation and treatment of depressive symptoms should receive special attention.

dementia often need support and guidance themselves, especially during difficult periods such as the care-transition from home towards a nursing home. Knowledge on needs of informal caregivers during this period is sparse. This study aims to provide insight into problems and needs of informal caregivers caring for people with dementia during care-transition from home-based care to institutional long-term care.","A systematic electronic search in CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, PsycINFO, Pubmed and Web of Knowledge. All qualitative articles up to September 2013 were considered. The included articles underwent a quality appraisal. Thematic analysis was used to analyze problems and needs described in the articles.","Thirteen publications were included providing 14 topics comprising needs and problems of informal caregivers during the care-transition period. The most stated topics were: \"emotional concerns\" (e.g. grief and shame about the decision), \"knowledge\/information\" (e.g. understanding the care system) and \"support\" (e.g. need for counseling). Similar topics were found prior and after admission, with examples specific to the either the home or nursing home situation.","The care-transition period should be considered a continuum, as similar needs and problems were identified prior and after admission. This should be kept in mind in developing support and guidance for informal caregivers during this process. Whereas currently the situation prior and post admission are seen and treated as adjacent stages, they should be considered one integrated stage. Multicomponent programmes should be offered that are designed in a continuous way, starting prior to admission, and continuing after."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Afram","ForeName":"Basema","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research,Faculty of Health,Medicine and Life Sciences,CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care,Maastricht University;Maastricht;the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verbeek","ForeName":"Hilde","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research,Faculty of Health,Medicine and Life Sciences,CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care,Maastricht University;Maastricht;the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bleijlevens","ForeName":"Michel H C","Initials":"MH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research,Faculty of Health,Medicine and Life Sciences,CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care,Maastricht University;Maastricht;the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hamers","ForeName":"Jan P H","Initials":"JP","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research,Faculty of Health,Medicine and Life Sciences,CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care,Maastricht University;Maastricht;the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"07"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Care Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":"nursing home"}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"4","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25287064","S1041610214002154","10.1017\/S1041610214002154"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25181988","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"01","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"01","Day":"26"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Professional care providers in dementia care in eight European countries; their training and involvement in early dementia stage and in home care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"931-57"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301214548520","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Knowledge concerning professionals involved in dementia care throughout its trajectory is sparse; the focus has mainly been on nursing-home care and less on home care, diagnosis and treatment of the disease and its complications despite the fact that home care is the most prominent type of care. The aim of this study was to explore and describe professional care providers involved in dementia care and their educational level applying the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and further to investigate practice in the RightTimePlaceCare-countries with regard to screening, diagnostic procedures and treatment of dementia and home care. The findings demonstrate more similarities than differences in terms of type of professionals involved among the countries although untrained staff were more common in some countries. Findings also show that many types of professionals are involved, who to turn to may not be clear, for instance in terms of medical specialities and it may be unclear who bears the ultimate responsibility. The professionals involved in diagnosis, treatment and care are educated to bachelor's level or above whilst everyday care is provided by people trained at a lower ISCED level or with no formal training. Registered nurses as well as occupational therapists have bachelor's degrees in most countries, but not in Germany or Estonia. Professionals specifically trained in dementia care are not so common. Further research is needed to reveal not only who provides the diagnostics and treatment, but also how home care is organised and quality assured. Many different types of professionals serve as providers along the trajectory of the disease which may be difficult for the patient and the informal caregiver to cope with.

the major difficulties encountered in dementia, which can have considerable negative impacts on the quality of life (QoL) of people with dementia (PwD). However, the extent to which basic ADL performance deteriorates across mild, moderate, and severe dementia is little examined and its impact, together with depression and neuropsychiatric behavior, upon QoL, is of considerable relevance across European countries.","Data were drawn from people living in the community who were participants in a large-scale European study on transition from community living to care homes of PwD. PwD completed measures on cognitive functioning and QoL, and informal carers reported upon QoL, depressive symptomatology, psychopathology, and functional ability of the PwD.","ADL performance deteriorated differently for each activity. In particular, toileting, transfer, and feeding remained relatively intact throughout, whereas performance on bathing and dressing deteriorated to a greater extent from mild to severe dementia. It appears that continence was not affected by the stage of dementia with similar levels of impairment. Basic ADL performance impacted to different degrees on QoL across dementia stages and countries.","Interventions aimed at maintaining independence or QoL need to target different ADLs across different dementia stages and perhaps also tailor interventions to the context of different countries. Findings contribute to the development of non-pharmaceutical interventions and governmental pledges to promote independence in dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Giebel","ForeName":"Clarissa M","Initials":"CM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychological Sciences,University of Manchester,Manchester,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sutcliffe","ForeName":"Caroline","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal Social Services Research Unit,University of Manchester,Manchester,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stolt","ForeName":"Minna","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing Science,University of Turku,Turku,Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Karlsson","ForeName":"Staffan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Sciences,Lund University,Lund,Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Renom-Guiteras","ForeName":"Anna","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing Science,Faculty of Health,University of Witten\/Herdecke,Witten,Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soto","ForeName":"Maria","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatric Medicine,Gerontopole,INSERM 1027,University Hospital de Toulouse,Toulouse,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verbeek","ForeName":"Hilde","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Services Research,Maastricht University,Maastricht,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zabalegui","ForeName":"Adelaida","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Hospital Clinic de Barcelona,Barcelona,Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Personal Social Services Research Unit,University of Manchester,Manchester,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"DTC-RP-PG-0311-12003","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"05","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Cultural Comparison"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Ethnopsychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Independent Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Competency"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"2","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24784234","S1041610214000775","10.1017\/S1041610214000775"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24411467","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"05"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"26","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Effects of small-scale, home-like facilities in dementia care on residents' behavior, and use of physical restraints and psychotropic drugs: a quasi-experimental study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"657-68"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610213002512","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Small-scale, home-like care environments are increasingly implemented in institutional nursing care as a model to promote resident-directed care, although evidence on its effects is sparse.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms were among the most often mentioned reasons in most countries. Besides patient-related reasons, caregiver burden and the inability of the informal caregiver to care for the patient were stated as reasons (both 15%). Further analyses showed countries differ significantly in reasons according to informal caregivers. Additionally, reasons were analyzed for spouses and child-caregivers, showing that spouses more often stated reasons related to themselves compared with child-caregivers.","Multiple reasons contribute to the institutionalization for people with dementia, with several factors that may influence why there were country differences. Variation in the organization of dementia care and cultural aspects, or the relationship between the informal caregiver and person with dementia may be factors influencing the reasons.

The inclusion criteria were: (1) the primary focus was on factors related to quality of life; (2) the study was performed in long-term care facilities; (3) the study regarded quality of life as multidimensional construct. Methodological quality of studies included in the review was assessed with a quality criteria checklist.","Ten cross-sectional and three longitudinal articles were included in the review. In cross-sectional studies, depressive symptoms were negatively related to self-rated quality of life of people with dementia. The association between depressive symptoms and proxy-rated quality of life was less clear. Behavioural disturbances, especially agitation, appeared to be negatively related to proxy-rated quality of life. There appeared to be a negative relation between quality of life, activities of daily living and cognition, although this could not be confirmed in all studies. In longitudinal studies, depressive symptoms were negatively related and cognition was positively related to self-rated quality of life, whereas dependency and depressive symptoms were negatively related to proxy-rated quality of life.","There are only few high quality studies that investigate associations of (change in) quality of life of people with dementia living in long-term care facilities. Our results suggest that depressive symptoms and agitation are related to lower quality of life. Perspective of quality of life measurement, i.e. self- or proxy rating, may influence its associations. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine which factors are related to change in quality of life over time.

However, at some point during the disease the needs of a significant number of people with dementia cannot be appropriately met at home and institutional care is required. Evidence as to best practice strategies enabling people with dementia to live at home as long as possible and also identifying the right time to trigger admission to a long-term nursing care facility is therefore urgently required. The current paper presents the rationale and methods of a study generating primary data for best-practice development in the transition from home towards institutional nursing care for people with dementia and their informal caregivers. The study has two main objectives: 1) investigate country-specific factors influencing institutionalization and 2) investigate the circumstances of people with dementia and their informal caregivers in eight European countries. Additionally, data for economic evaluation purposes are being collected.","This paper describes a prospective study, conducted in eight European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, United Kingdom). A baseline assessment and follow-up measurement after 3 months will be performed. Two groups of people with dementia and their informal caregivers will be included: 1) newly admitted to institutional long-term nursing care facilities; and 2) receiving professional long-term home care, and being at risk for institutionalization. Data will be collected on outcomes for people with dementia (e.g. quality of life, quality of care), informal caregivers (e.g. caregiver burden, quality of life) and costs (e.g. resource utilization). Statistical analyses consist of descriptive and multivariate regression techniques and cross-country comparisons.","The current study, which is part of a large European project 'RightTimePlaceCare', generates primary data on outcomes and costs of long-term nursing care for people with dementia and their informal caregivers, specifically focusing on the transition from home towards institutional care. Together with data collected in three other work packages, knowledge gathered in this study will be used to inform and empower patients, professionals, policy and related decision makers to manage and improve health and social dementia care

Despite the increase of these facilities, little is known about experiences of family caregivers of residents and nursing staff.","To gain an in-depth insight into the experiences of family caregivers and nursing staff with small-scale living facilities.","A process evaluation was conducted alongside the final measurement of an effectiveness study, using a cross-sectional, descriptive design.","Two types of institutional dementia care in the Netherlands: small-scale living facilities and regular wards in nursing homes.","In total, 130 family caregivers and 309 nursing staff workers in both care settings participated in a survey questionnaire. Additional in-depth interviews were conducted with a random selection of 24 participants in small-scale living facilities: 13 family caregivers and 11 nursing staff workers.","Survey questions for family caregivers focused on care service delivery; questions for nursing staff were related to skills. The interviews especially related to positive and negative aspects of small-scale living facilities and skills for nursing staff.","Both family caregivers and staff mainly reported positive experiences with small-scale living facilities, especially the personal attention that nursing staff provides to residents, their involvement with residents and the emphasis on autonomy in daily life.

In addition, care dependency was measured using Dutch Care Severity Packages (DCSP). Finally, gender, age, living condition prior to admission and length of stay were recorded. Descriptive analyses, including independent samples t- tests and chi-square tests, were used. To analyze data in more detail, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.","Residents living in small-scale, homelike facilities had a significantly higher functional status and cognitive performance compared with residents in regular psychogeriatric wards.

dementia are rising in current dementia care. In these facilities, a small number of residents live together and form a household with staff. Normal, daily life and social participation are emphasized. It is expected that these facilities improve residents' quality of life. Moreover, it may have a positive influence on staff's job satisfaction and families involvement and satisfaction with care. However, effects of these small-scale and homelike facilities have hardly been investigated. Since the number of people with dementia increases, and institutional long-term care is more and more organized in small-scale and homelike facilities, more research into effects is necessary. This paper presents the design of a study investigating effects of small-scale living facilities in the Netherlands on residents, family caregivers and nursing staff.","A longitudinal, quasi-experimental study is carried out, in which 2 dementia care settings are compared: small-scale living facilities and regular psychogeriatric wards in traditional nursing homes. Data is collected from residents, their family caregivers and nursing staff at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Approximately 2 weeks prior to baseline measurement, residents are screened on cognition and activities of daily living (ADL). Based on this screening profile, residents in psychogeriatric wards are matched to residents living in small-scale living facilities. The primary outcome measure for residents is quality of life. In addition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms and social engagement are assessed. Involvement with care, perceived burden and satisfaction with care provision are primary outcome variables for family caregivers. The primary outcomes for nursing staff are job satisfaction and motivation. Furthermore, job characteristics social support, autonomy and workload are measured. A process evaluation is performed to investigate to what extent small-scale living facilities and psychogeriatric wards are designed as they were intended. In addition, participants' satisfaction and experiences with small-scale living facilities are investigated.","A longitudinal, quasi-experimental study is presented to investigate effects of small-scale living facilities. Although some challenges concerning this design exist, it is currently the most feasible method to assess effects of this relatively new dementia care

domestic-style care settings which emphasize normalized living. However, a systematic overview of existing types is lacking. This study provides an international comparison of the care concepts which have adopted a homelike philosophy in a small-scale context. Insight into their characteristics is vital for theory, planning and implementation of such dementia care settings.","A literature search was performed using various electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, CINAHL and PsycINFO. In addition, \"gray\" literature was identified on the internet. Concepts were analyzed according to five main characteristics: physical setting, number of residents, residents' characteristics, domestic characteristics and care concept.","75 papers were included covering 11 different concept types in various countries. Similarities among concepts reflected a focus on meaningful activities centered around the daily household. Staff have integrated tasks and are part of the household, and archetypical home-style features, such as kitchens, are incorporated in the buildings. Differences among concepts were found mainly in the physical settings, numbers of residents and residents' characteristics. Some concepts have become regular dementia care settings, while others are smaller initiatives.","The care concepts are implemented in various ways with a changing staff role. However, many aspects of these small, homelike facilities remain unclear. Future research is needed, focusing on residents' characteristics, family, staff and costs."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verbeek","ForeName":"Hilde","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School for Public Health and Primary Care, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. h.verbeek@zw.unimaas.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Rossum","ForeName":"Erik","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zwakhalen","ForeName":"Sandra M G","Initials":"SM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kempen","ForeName":"Gertrudis I J M","Initials":"GI"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hamers","ForeName":"Jan P H","Initials":"JP"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"23"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Consumer Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Cultural Comparison"},{"DescriptorName":"Deinstitutionalization"},{"DescriptorName":"Facility Design and Construction"},{"DescriptorName":"Group Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Facility Size"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Environment"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"90"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"24","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"24","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"5","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19102801","S104161020800820X","10.1017\/S104161020800820X"]}}}]}
