An online self-management support intervention was therefore developed and conducted involving the following elements: (1) email contact with a specialized dementia nurse, (2) online videos, and (3) e-bulletins containing information about behavior changes and how to manage them.","The aim of this study was to understand (1) family caregivers' actual use of various elements of the online self-management support, (2) family caregivers' evaluation and satisfaction with the various elements, and (3) nurses' usage and evaluations of the online support through the tailored email contacts.","A mixed methods design was used in this process evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods including analyses of dementia nurses' registration forms, the number of clicks on online videos and e-bulletins, evaluation questions answered by family caregivers in a survey questionnaire, semistructured interviews with family caregivers and nurses, and analysis of the content of the email contacts.","The actual use of various elements of the online self-management support by family caregivers varied: 78% (21\/27) of family caregivers had an email contact with the specialist nurse, 80% (43\/54) of family caregivers clicked on an online video, and 37% (30\/81) clicked on an e-bulletin. Family caregivers showed positive evaluations and satisfaction. The tailor-made approach in the personal email contacts in particular was valued by the family caregivers. Nurses' evaluations about providing self-management support online were mixed as it was a relatively new task for them.","An important insight is that not all participants made optimum use of the various elements of the intervention. Nurses also said that the email contacts were more often used to express feelings about coping with behavioral changes. More research is needed to investigate the reasons why people accept, adopt, and adhere to online interventions to reduce cases where they are not used and to back them up appropriately with tailored (online) information and advice for their personal situations."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9Judith G Huis in het Veld, Iris F M van Asch, Bernadette M Willemse, Paul-Jeroen Verkade, Anne Margriet Pot, Marco M Blom, Rob B M Groot Zwaaftink, Anneke L Francke.

However, quality of care in care homes needs improvement. It is important to monitor quality of care in care homes for the purposes of conducting scientific research, providing input for policy, and promoting practice improvement.","The Living Arrangements for people with Dementia -study monitors changes in - quality of - care in care homes since 2008. With its extended design, the Living Arrangements for people with Dementia -study now also focuses on additional topics that are considered to improve quality of care: implementation of person-centred care, involvement of family carers and volunteers and reducing psychotropic drugs and physical restraints using a multidisciplinary approach.","The data collection of the Living Arrangements for people with Dementia -study entails an interview with the manager and questionnaires are completed by care staff, family carers, volunteers, and multidisciplinary team members. This study is partly funded by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports, grant number 323,088 and partly funded by the participating care homes.","Results of the Living Arrangements for people with Dementia -study will shed more light on variables related to quality of care in care homes for people with dementia.","Based on the obtained information, appropriate efforts to improve quality of care can be discussed and implemented. Furthermore, the results of this study guide policy making, because it expands knowledge about the effects of changing policies and exposes topics that need further attention.","Not applicable.

caregivers frequently report difficulties in maintaining their usual activities. We had previously developed a set of indicators to estimate whether dyadic, activating interventions can meet these needs for activity. This study investigates how PWDs and informal caregivers talk about the indicators in interviews for needs assessments, and how professionals identify activity needs and preferences. Our research goal was to explore the usefulness of the indicators for assessing the activity needs of community-dwelling dyads. Such assessments are needed for appropriate referral to activating interventions.","A dementia case manager assessed the needs of community-dwelling PWDs and their informal caregivers; we carried out secondary analyses on the dataset resulting from the audio-tapes and transcripts. We applied qualitative, deductive content analysis because we wanted to identify both explicit and implicit needs and preferences. We used the indicators that we had developed in previous research as codes.","Both PWDs and informal caregivers do explicitly mention needs, preferences, and characteristics related to the indicators in the needs assessments. Possible implicit needs and preferences were frequently identified in their stories.","Needs-driven care requires high-quality needs assessments. Both PWDs and their informal caregivers need encouragement to express their latent needs and preferences. In addition, latent needs and preferences have to be further explored in needs assessments to find out the real meaning. The outcomes of this study highlight the significance of structured needs assessments for mapping the activity needs of PWDs and their informal caregivers. Many PWDs and informal caregivers reported activity needs, which suggests that activating interventions may be appropriate. The indicators can help professionals identify activity needs so that they can discuss matching activating interventions with the dyad."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leven","ForeName":"Netta

Several dyadic, psychosocial, activating interventions were developed to create insight into how to cope with limitations in a practical way and to increase skills for maintaining personal activities. Effects of these interventions varied so far. More knowledge on the working mechanisms of activating interventions might help to increase their impact. This study will provide more insights into the working mechanisms of three dyadic, psychosocial, activating interventions as the participating PWD, caregivers, and coaches perceived them during the interventions.","We used a qualitative design with semi-structured interviews of 34 dyads that included 27 PWD, 34 caregivers, and 19 coaches. The data were analyzed with the constant comparative method.","Many PWD and caregivers found capacity-building approaches beneficial. We identified \"empowerment\" as the core theme. Three working mechanisms explained why the interventions were perceived as having a beneficial impact: 1) enabling activities without providing false hope; 2) exploring the most important personal activity needs of the PWD and caregivers; and 3) a solution-focused approach to adapt, test, and practice activities. An individualized approach contributed to positive change.","For the overarching working mechanism empowerment, expertise in the field of dementia and psychological skills of coaches seem to be important. Assessing the needs, capacities, and limitations of both the PWD and the caregivers to take part in activities seems to be key, as well as the communication about it and the skills to teach a solution-focused approach. Studies on the impact of psychosocial and activating interventions might benefit from considering outcome measures directed at empowerment, along with aspects such as hope and belief in one's own capacities versus traditional outcome measures as mood, burden, or quality of life."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leven","ForeName":"Netta Van't","Initials":"NV","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research

caregivers, families and societies at large. There has been a growing impetus to utilize Internet interventions given the potential scalability, and presumed cost-effectiveness and accessibility. In this paper, we describe the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to study the impact of online self-help programs on caregivers of people with dementia in India. The experimental group will receive an interactive training and support program and the comparison group will receive an education-only e-book. It will be among the first online support intervention RCTs for a mental health condition in a lower-middle income country.","Two hundred and eight participants are expected to be recruited via several strategies (email, Internet and social media, telephone and face-to-face) starting in the Bangalore region of India. The inclusion criteria for participation in the trial are: (1) being 18\u00a0years or older, (2) being a self-reported caregiver of a person with dementia, (3) self-report that a family member has a diagnosis of dementia (AD8\u00a0\u2265\u20092), and experience caregiver distress (\u2265\u20094 on a 1-item burden scale ranging from 1 to 10 or\u2009\u2265\u20094 or\u2009<\u200920 on the Center for Epidemiologic Study-Depression (CES-D) scale (10-item) or\u2009\u2265\u20094 or\u2009<\u200915 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (7-item). The intervention group will be offered iSupport, an online self-help training and support program, enabling a personalized education plan with a maximum of 23 lessons. These modules present a range of topics from \"what is dementia?\" to \"dealing with challenging behaviors like aggression.\" The comparison group will receive an education-only e-book containing similar content. The outcomes of this trial are: caregiver burden as measured by the 22-item Zarit Burden Scale, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), quality of life, person-centered attitude, self-efficacy and mastery (secondary outcomes).","Based on the findings of this trial, we will examine the potential use and scale up of iSupport for caregiver distress in India. This style of online self-help programs could be expanded to other regions or countries or to other suitable caregiver groups.","Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI), ID: CTRI\/2017\/02\/007876

to society. On a global scale, family and other unpaid care predominates. Supporting caregivers is crucial, but scalable interventions are currently lacking. Because a growing number of studies have suggested that online training and support programs hold considerable promise for scaling up, we reviewed existing literature.","We systematically searched 6 databases to identify studies of Internet-based interventions designed to train and support caregivers of people with dementia, and we formally assessed risk of bias. Our prespecified primary outcomes of interest included both mental health and caregiver burden\/perceived stress. Our secondary outcomes of interest included knowledge, quality of life of caregivers, quality of care, caregiver response to challenging behaviors, coping, and self-efficacy.","Eight randomized control trials met our inclusion criteria involving over 900 participants. The content and structure of Internet-based interventions, outcome measures, and duration differed markedly, and selection, performance, and reporting biases were varied and on occasion of concern. Six studies reported outcomes in caregivers' mental health outcomes, 3 studies reported burden outcomes. Three studies reported knowledge skills, quality of life and reaction to challenging behaviours, whereas 2 studies reported changes in coping outcomes and self-efficacy. No studies reported outcomes on quality of care.","Although there is some evidence that Internet-based interventions can improve mental health outcomes for informal caregivers of people with dementia, marked methodological diversity across studies prevented the robust pooling of the results.

Over the years, various factors are suggested which may contribute to or disable activity provision in dementia care homes. These include limited financial resources, task oriented staff and disease-related characteristics of residents. This study aims to further clarify which of these factors predict higher activity involvement.","Data were derived from the second measurement (2011) of the Living Arrangements for people with Dementia study. One thousand two hundred eighteen people residing in 139 dementia care homes were involved. Forty predictors of higher involvement were studied. Multilevel backward regression analyses were performed.","The most important predictors of higher involvement were: absence of agitation, less ADL dependency, and a higher cognitive status of the residents, higher staff educational level, lower experienced job demands by care staff and a smaller number of residents living in the dementia care wards of a facility. More social supervisor support as perceived by staff was found to predict less activity involvement.","To increase the activity involvement of care home residents with dementia it seems vital to: 1) reduce staff's experienced job demands; 2) elevate their overall educational level; 3) train staff to provide suitable activities, taking account of the behavior and preserved capabilities of residents; and 4) foster transition towards small-scale care. In order to achieve these aims, care organizations might need to evaluate the use of their financial means."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smit","ForeName":"Dieneke","Initials":"D","Identifier":"0000-0001-9742-3154","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department

To deliver a person-centred approach, it is crucial to take needs, characteristics and preferences of people with dementia and their informal caregivers into account. However, these factors are generally not systematically checked in order to determine which intervention will be most appropriate. Additionally, little is known about which intervention suits which needs, characteristics and preferences. Therefore, this study examined how three multiple-component, activating dyadic interventions fitted needs, characteristics, and preferences of both the people with dementia and their informal caregivers: the Pleasant Events Program, the Exercise and Support Intervention for People with Dementia and Their Caregivers, and Occupational Therapy. Semi-structured interviews were held with participants in either one of the interventions, 34 dyads and 19 professionals. The constant comparative method was used for the analysis. Five factors influenced the dyad's 'fit': timing, need for activity, lifestyle, apart-or-together and meaning of (lost) activity. The factors 'timing' and a 'need for activity' were conditional for these activating interventions. Dyads in an early stage of dementia, who were aware of the effects on daily life, were open to a change in routine, and had a need to maintain activities profited from these interventions. Three distinctive factors were important for the fit of one of the three interventions in particular: 'lifestyle', 'apart or together' and 'meaning of (lost) activity'. The Pleasant Events Programme and the Exercise and Support intervention properly addressed the need for activities that afforded daily pastimes or structure. The Exercise and Support Intervention addressed the need for physical activity and emphasized shared activity. Occupational Therapy properly addressed the need for self-sufficiency, maintaining activities and adjustment to physical limitations. These factors can contribute to a more person-centred application of the interventions."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van't Leven","ForeName":"Netta","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise Innovations in Care, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Lange","ForeName":"Jacomine","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise Innovations in Care, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Prick","ForeName":"Anna-Eva","Initials":"AE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; EMGO+-Institute: Institute for Health and Care Research, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne Margriet","Initials":"AM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; EMGO+-Institute: Institute for Health and Care Research, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"08","Day":"10"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Exercise Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Occupational Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychosocial Support Systems"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["caregivers","dementia","intervention","person-centred care","qualitative research"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27509919","1471301216662378","10.1177\/1471301216662378"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27099480","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"09","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1178-1998","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"Clinical interventions in aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Clin Interv Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"The effects of a multicomponent dyadic intervention on the mood, behavior, and physical health of people with dementia: a randomized controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"383-95"},"ELocationID":"10.2147\/CIA.S95789","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The effects of a multicomponent dyadic intervention on the mood, behavior, and physical health of people with dementia living in the community were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. This multicomponent dyadic intervention is a translated and adapted version of an intervention that has been shown to be effective for people with dementia in the US.","People with dementia living in the community and their family caregivers (N=111 caregiver-care recipient dyads) were randomly assigned to the intervention and comparison group. The intervention group received home-based physical exercise training, psycho-education, communication skills training, and pleasant activities training during 3 months directed at both the person with dementia and the caregiver. Mood, behavior, and physical health were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The effects of the study were determined by using generalized estimating equations based on an intention-to-treat analysis.","Analyses showed no beneficial effects over time on any of the outcome measures.","This study showed no effects. The negative results in this study compared to the study that has been carried out in the US might be explained by the translation, adaptation, and shortening of the intervention used in the US, and a different social context. In addition, the results might be explained by the lack of room for improvement and by experiencing the intervention as too much of a burden. Furthermore, improving physical health might only be effective if the physical exercises are of moderate-to-high-intensity and are tailored in accordance with participants' preferences and needs. For future studies, because dyads often commented positively about the pleasure and support they received, it might also be valuable to measure quality of life outcomes such as relationship quality, pleasure, and self-esteem in dyadic focused

In this study the following four models are distinguished, based on differences in the availability of the service and in the case management function: Model 1: the case management service is available from first dementia symptoms + is always a separate specialist function; Model 2: the case management service is only available after a formal dementia diagnosis + is always a separate specialist function; Model 3: the case management service is available from first dementia symptoms + is often a combined function; Model 4: the case management service is only available after a formal dementia diagnosis + is often a combined function. The objectives of this study are to give insight into whether satisfaction with dementia case management and the development of caregiver burden depend on the organisational model.","A survey was carried out in regional dementia care networks in the Netherlands among 554 informal carers for people with dementia at the start of case management (response of 85 %), and one year later. Descriptive statistics and multilevel models were used to analyse the data.","The satisfaction with the case manager was high in general (an average of 8.0 within a possible range of 1 to 10), although the caregiver burden did not decrease in the first year after starting with case management. No differences were found between the four organisational models regarding the development of caregiver burden. However, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found regarding satisfaction: informal carers in the organisational model where case management is only available after formal diagnosis of dementia and is often a combined function had on average the lowest satisfaction scores. Nevertheless, the satisfaction of informal carers within all organisational models was high (ranging from 7.51 to 8.40 within a range of 1 to 10).","Organisational features of case management seem to make little or no difference to the development in caregiver burden and the satisfaction of informal carers.

Participants perceived OFGs as a useful tool to explore their perspectives. The perceived advantage of OFGs was the flexibility and convenience of logging in at any time or place preferred. Five facilitating factors for case management were identified in the OFGs: 1. Good cooperation between partners; 2. Organisational embedding with an independent position of case managers; 3. Structural funding; 4. Competent case managers; 5. Familiarity with case management in the region. Good cooperation was essential for successful dementia case management and should thus be a primary concern for care providers."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Lange","ForeName":"Jacomine","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Program on Aging, Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Research Centre Innovations in Care, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deusing","ForeName":"Eline","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Program on Aging, Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Asch","ForeName":"Iris Fm","Initials":"IF","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Program on Aging, Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Peeters","ForeName":"Jos\u00e9","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"NIVEL, Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zwaanswijk","ForeName":"Marieke","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"NIVEL, Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research, Utrecht, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne Margriet","Initials":"AM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Program on Aging, Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Clinical Psychology, EMGO+, VU University Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Francke","ForeName":"Anneke L","Initials":"AL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"NIVEL, Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Public and Occupational Health, EMGO+, VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"02","Day":"24"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Case Management","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Internet"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Internet","case management","dementia","focus groups","online"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26915714","1471301216634959","10.1177\/1471301216634959"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26830698","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"11"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"28","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"06"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Is an unhealthy work environment in nursing home care for people with dementia associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and physical restraints?","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"983-94"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610216000028","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Research showed that long-term care facilities differ widely in the use of psychotropic drugs and physical restraints.

Work environment was assessed using the Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire (LQWQ).","Logistic regression analyses showed that more supervisor support was associated with less prescription of benzodiazepines. Coworker support was found to be related to less prescription of deep chairs. Job demands and decision authority were not found to be predictors of psychotropic drugs and physical restraints.","Staff's job characteristics were scarcely related to the prescription of psychotropic drugs and physical restraints. This finding indicates that in facilities with an unhealthy work environment for nursing staff, one is not more likely to prescribe drugs or restraints.

including a combination of intervention strategies and addressing both the person with dementia and caregiver - have a beneficial impact on the mental and physical health of people with dementia and their family caregivers. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a multi-component dyadic intervention, which is a translated and adapted version of an intervention that has been shown to be effective in the US by Teri et al. (2003), was performed. The effects on caregivers' mood (primary outcome), burden, general health, and salivary cortisol levels (secondary outcomes) were studied.","Community-dwelling people with dementia and their family caregivers (N = 111 dyads) were randomly assigned. The experimental group received eight home visits during three months, combining physical exercise and support (psycho-education, communication skills training, and planning of pleasant activities). Both the physical exercise and support component were directed at both the person with dementia and the caregiver. The comparison group received monthly information bulletins and phone calls. There were three measurements at baseline (prior to the intervention), at three months, and at six months into the intervention. Data were analyzed with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) based on an intention-to-treat analysis of all available data.","All analyses showed no benefits of the intervention over time on any of the outcomes.","The negative results might be explained by the translation and adaptation of the intervention that has been shown to be effective in the US: the intervention was shortened and did not include cognitive reframing. However, only the health effects on people with dementia and not on caregivers were studied in the US. Several other factors might also have played a role, which are important for future studies to take into account. These are: the usual health care in the country or region of implementation; the wishes and needs of participants for specific intervention components; the room for improvement regarding these components; the inclusion of positive outcome measures, such as pleasure, and the quality of the relationship."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Prick","ForeName":"Anna-Eva","Initials":"AE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical Psychology and the EMGO institute for Health and Care Research,Faculty of Psychology and Education,VU University,Van der Boechorststraat 1,1081 BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Lange","ForeName":"Jacomine","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Centre Innovations in Care,Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences,Rochussenstraat 198,3015 EK Rotterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Twisk","ForeName":"Jos","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and the EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research,VU University Medical Centre,De Boelelaan 1118,1081 HV Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne Margriet","Initials":"AM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical Psychology and the EMGO institute for Health and Care Research,Faculty of Psychology and Education,VU University,Van der Boechorststraat 1,1081 BT Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"WI4X0X7BPJ","NameOfSubstance":"Hydrocortisone"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Affect"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost-Benefit Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression"},{"DescriptorName":"Exercise"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"House Calls"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Hydrocortisone","QualifierName":"analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","mental health","prevention","treatment"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"5","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"5","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26004290","S104161021500071X","10.1017\/S104161021500071X"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25679228","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"01","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"10","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2015"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS One"},"ArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of an Internet intervention for family caregivers of people with dementia: results of a randomized controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e0116622"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0116622","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The World Health Organization stresses the importance of accessible and (cost)effective caregiver support, given the expected increase in the number of people with dementia and the detrimental impact on the mental health of family caregivers.","This study assessed the effectiveness of the Internet intervention 'Mastery over Dementia'. In a RCT, 251 caregivers, of whom six were lost at baseline, were randomly assigned to two groups. Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.","Almost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).","The Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable. The findings are even more promising because future generations of family caregivers will be more familiar with the Internet.","Dutch Trial Register NTR-2051

Evaluation of the study population quality revealed a profound recruitment process resulting in a reasonable sample size. Attrition rate during follow-up was acceptable.

dementia in relation to their work environment and job-related well-being.","Given the development towards person-centred care and labour force issues, research has recently focused on the effect of person-centredness on nursing staff's well-being. Findings from occupational stress research suggest that employees' personal characteristics, such as person-centredness, can moderate the impact particular job characteristics have on their job-related well-being.","Cross-sectional survey.","A national survey was conducted among healthcare staff (n = 1147) in 136 living arrangements for people with dementia in the Netherlands (2008-2009). Hierarchical regression analyses were used.","Person-centredness moderates the relationship between coworker support and three outcomes of job-related well-being and between supervisor support and two of these outcomes. For highly person-centred nursing staff, coworker support was found to have a weaker impact and supervisor support to have a stronger impact on their job-related well-being. In addition, direct effects showed that person-centredness was weakly associated with more job satisfaction, more emotional exhaustion and more strongly with more personal accomplishment.","Nursing staff's person-centredness does play a modest role in relation to job characteristics and job-related well-being. Findings indicate that person-centredness is not only beneficial to residents with dementia as found earlier, but also for nursing staff themselves; specifically, in case nursing staff members feel supported by their supervisor. Since a more person-centred workforce feels more competent, further implementation of person-centred care might have a positive impact on the attractiveness of the profession."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Willemse","ForeName":"Bernadette M","Initials":"BM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Program on Aging, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Department of Clinical Psychology, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"De Jonge","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smit","ForeName":"Dieneke","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Visser","ForeName":"Quirijn","Initials":"Q"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Depla","ForeName":"Marja F I A","Initials":"MF"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne Margriet","Initials":"AM"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Adv Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"7609811","ISSNLinking":"0309-2402"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Burnout, Professional","QualifierName":"etiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interprofessional Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Job Satisfaction"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["burnout","coworker support","decision-authority","dementia","healthcare staff","job demands","job satisfaction","nursing","person-centred care","supervisor support"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2014","Month":"07","Day":"12"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"9","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25123418","10.1111\/jan.12505"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25117793","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"07","Day":"08"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"19","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2015"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Staff-resident interactions in long-term care for people with dementia: the role of meeting psychological needs in achieving residents' well-being.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"444-52"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2014.944088","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which staff-resident interactions address or undermine residents' psychological needs and how such interactions are associated with residents' well-being.","Data on staff-resident interactions and residents' well-being were collected for 51 residents from nine long-term care settings using dementia care mapping (DCM).

Patients and caregivers will be followed for 18 months during the period January 2012 to December 2013. Patient characteristics will be collected at baseline. Time to death or institutionalization will be measured. Co-morbidity will be assessed using the Charlson index. Psychotropic drug use and primary and secondary outcome measures will be measured at 3 assessments, baseline, 9 and 18 months. The primary outcome measures are the Neuropsychiatric Inventory score for patients with dementia and the Sense of Competence score for informal caregivers. In addition to descriptive analyses frequency parameters will be computed. Univariate analysis will be performed to identify determinants of the course of NPS and informal caregiver distress. All determinants will then be tested in a multivariate regression analysis to determine their unique contribution to the course of NPS and caregiver distress.","The results of this study will provide data on the course of NPS, which is clinically important for prognosis.

To increase residents' occupation, knowledge of types of occupation related to wellbeing, and organizational and environmental characteristics encouraging involvement in these types of occupation, is indispensable.","In this explorative study, Dementia Care Mapping was used to study involvement in different types of occupation and wellbeing among 57 residents of 10 dementia care facilities. For each type of occupation, mean experienced wellbeing was studied. Occupation types with high mean wellbeing scores were classified as \"wellbeing-enhancing occupation.\" Care facilities were ranked according to the mean time residents spent in types of wellbeing-enhancing occupation. Using information on staff-to-resident ratio, individual space, and items of the Physical Environment Evaluation Component of Dementia Care Mapping, organizational and environmental characteristics of the facilities were compared to study their relationship with wellbeing-enhancing occupation.","Reminiscence, leisure, expression, and vocational occupation had greatest potential to enhance wellbeing, but these types were seldom offered. Much variation existed in the extent to which wellbeing-enhancing occupation was provided. Long-term care facilities that did so more frequently generally had a more homelike atmosphere, supported social interaction through the environment, and had no central activity program.","This study suggests that it is possible to engage residents in wellbeing-enhancing occupation, within current means of budget and staff.

Programs with intervention components that actively train one or more specific functional domains for the person with dementia and\/or the caregiver seem to have a beneficial impact on that domain, although there are exceptions. Reasons can be found in the program itself, the implementation of the program, and the study design.","Dyadic psychosocial programs are effective, but the outcomes for the person with dementia and the caregiver vary.

There is an urgent need to develop cost effective approaches that meet the needs of people with dementia and their family caregivers. Depression, feelings of burden and caregiver stress are common and serious health problems in these family caregivers. Different kinds of interventions are developed to prevent or reduce the negative psychological consequences of caregiving. The use of internet interventions is still very limited, although they may be a cost effective way to support family caregivers in an earlier stage and diminish their psychological distress in the short and longer run.","A pragmatic randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 'Mastery over Dementia', an internet intervention for caregivers of people with dementia. The intervention aims at prevention and decrease of psychological distress, in particular depressive symptoms. The experimental condition consists of an internet course with 8 sessions and a booster session over a maximum period of 6 months guided by a psychologist. Caregivers in the comparison condition receive a minimal intervention. In addition to a pre and post measurement, an intermediate measurement will be conducted. In addition, there will be two follow-up measurements 3 and 6 months after post-treatment in the experimental group only. To study the effectiveness of the intervention, depressive symptoms are used as the primary outcome, whereas symptoms of anxiety, role overload and caregiver perceived stress are used as secondary outcomes. To study which caregivers profit most of the internet intervention, several variables that may modify the impact of the intervention are taken into account. Regarding the cost-effectiveness, an economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective.","This study will provide evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an internet intervention for caregivers. If both can be shown, this might set the stage for the development of a range of internet interventions in the field of caregiving for people with dementia.

homes (GLHs) on informal caregiver distress was compared with modern yet regular nursing homes (NHs).","Informal caregivers of GLH (N = 37) and NH residents (N = 49) were studied at the time of admission, 6 months thereafter, and approximately 24 months after admission. Repeated measures of ANOVA were performed to study group-by-time effects on psychopathology, role overload, and feelings of competence.","All outcomes of psychological distress in GLH caregivers showed significantly greater decline compared with NH caregivers during the first six months after admission. The course of psychological distress stabilized in both caregiver groups after six months.","GLHs may have played a role in reducing caregiver burden during the first six months after the nursing home admission of the care recipient. The stabilization of caregivers' psychological distress between T1 and T2 may indicate that there is no further room for improvement in the GLH and NH groups after six months. The implication would be that both GLHs and NHs succeeded in keeping caregivers' distress relatively low over the long term. More knowledge is needed on whether and how caregivers' psychological distress after institutionalization of the care recipient can be reduced to a greater extent."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smit","ForeName":"Dieneke","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Program on Aging, Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction, Utrecht, The Netherlands. dsmit@trimbos.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"te Boekhorst","ForeName":"Selma","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Lange","ForeName":"Jacomine","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Depla","ForeName":"Marja F I A","Initials":"MF"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"Jan A","Initials":"JA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne Margriet","Initials":"AM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"N"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne M","Initials":"AM"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"ErratumIn"},"RefSource":"Aging Ment Health. 2011 Aug;15(6):796","Note":"Pot, Anne M [corrected to Pot, Anne Margriet]"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Group Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Socioeconomic Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Time"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"8","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"8","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"13","Hour":"0","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21815847","10.1080\/13607863.2010.551339"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21780960","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"04","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2012","Month":"01","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2012"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"A pilot study on the use of tracking technology: feasibility, acceptability, and benefits for people in early stages of dementia and their informal caregivers.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"127-34"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2011.596810","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Caregivers and clinicians may be confronted with the dilemma whether to allow people in early stages of dementia to go outside independently with the risk of getting lost, or to limit their autonomy and mobility.

The aim of this study is to include living arrangements from every part of this spectrum, ranging from large scale nursing homes to small group living homes. The LAD-study exists of quantitative and qualitative research. Primary outcomes of the quantitative study are wellbeing of care staff, quality of care and quality of life of residents. Furthermore, data concerning staff ratio and characteristics of the living arrangements such as group living home care characteristics are assessed. To get more in-depth insight into the barriers and facilitators in living arrangements for people with dementia to provide good care, focus groups and Dementia Care Mapping are carried out.","Results of this study are important for policymakers, directors and staff of living arrangements providing nursing home care to people with dementia and essential for the development of methods to improve quality of care, residents' and staff well-being.

However, the variability in adaptation emphasizes the need to target postplacement clinical interventions to families most at risk for negative outcomes during the transition to institutional care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gaugler","ForeName":"Joseph E","Initials":"JE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Center on Aging, Center for Gerontological Nursing, School of Nursing, The University of Minnesota, 308 Harvard Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. gaug0015@umn.edu"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pot","ForeName":"Anne Margriet","Initials":"AM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zarit","ForeName":"Steven H","Initials":"SH"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MH-4212","Acronym":"MH","Agency":"NIMH NIH HHS","Country":"United States"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Gerontologist","NlmUniqueID":"0375327","ISSNLinking":"0016-9013"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Los Angeles"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"San Francisco"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"1","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"4","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"1","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18192627","47\/6\/730","10.1093\/geront\/47.6.730"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17457793","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"05","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Effects of combined intervention programmes for people with dementia living at home and their caregivers: a systematic review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1181-93"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This study reviews the evidence for effects of combined intervention programmes for both the informal caregiver and the person with dementia.","Systematic review.
