Family caregivers can feel frustrated with limited contact with their relatives, which results in visits that are perceived as stressful and not very meaningful. Few psychosocial interventions are specifically developed for people with advanced dementia, and actively involve family caregivers or volunteers. Also, interventions usually stop when it becomes difficult for people to participate. The Namaste Care Family programme aims to increase the quality of life of people with advanced dementia, and improve family caregiving experiences through connecting to people and making them comfortable.","Our study will evaluate the effects of the Namaste Care Family programme on quality of life of people with advanced dementia living in nursing homes and family caregiving experiences using a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Longitudinal analyses will be performed taking into account clustering at the nursing home level. Both a cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective will be performed. We will modify the Namaste Care Family programme to increase family and volunteer involvement in ongoing and end-of-life care. Data collection involves assessments by family caregivers, nursing staff and elderly care physicians using questionnaires, and observations by the researchers at baseline and multiple times over 12 months. The last questionnaire will be sent up to month 24 after the death of the person with dementia. During semistructured interviews, the feasibility, accessibility and sustainability of the Namaste Care Family programme will be assessed.","The study protocol is approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam (protocol no. 2016.399) and registered with the Nederlands Trial Register (NTR5692). The findings will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and presentations for healthcare professionals where appropriate.","NTR5692."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

performed in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia but without delirium, to provide estimates of false positive rates for detecting delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD).","This cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatients and institutionalized patients without delirium representing a wide spectrum of severity of cognitive impairments.","Patients with dementia or a cognitive disorder according to DSM IV criteria, after exclusion of (suspected) delirium according to DSM IV criteria.","Tests for inattention and disorganized thinking from the CAM-ICU were assessed.","The sample included 163 patients (mean age 83 years (SD 6; 64% women)), with Alzheimer's disease as most prevalent (45%) diagnosis and a mean MMSE-score of 16.8 (SD 7.5). False positive rates of the test of attention varied from 0.04 in patients with normal to borderline cognitive function to 0.8 in those with severe dementia. The false positive rate of the test of disorganized thinking was zero in the normal to borderline group, increasing to 0.67 in patients with severe dementia. When combining test results false positive rates decreased to 0.03 in patients with MMSE scores above 9.","Use of simple bedside tests of attention and organized thinking for the clinical diagnosis of DSD will result in high rates of false positive observations if used regardless of the severity of dementia. However, if test results are combined they may be useful to exclude DSD in patients with minimal to moderate degrees of dementia, but not in the severe

methodological limitations and gaps in the evidence base for the arts in dementia care. In response, we developed a 12-week visual art program and evaluated the impact on people living with dementia through a mixed-methods longitudinal investigation.","One hundred and twenty-five people living with mild to severe dementia were recruited across three research settings in England and Wales (residential care homes, a county hospital, and community venues). Quantitative and qualitative data on quality of life (QoL), communication and perceptions of the program were obtained through interviews and self-reports with participants and their carers. Eight domains of well-being were measured using a standardized observation tool, and data compared to an alternative activity with no art.","Across all sites, scores for the well-being domains of interest, attention, pleasure, self-esteem, negative affect, and sadness were significantly better in the art program than the alternative condition. Proxy-reported QoL significantly improved between baseline and 3-month follow-up, but no improvements in QoL were reported by the participants with dementia. This was contrasted by their qualitative accounts, which described a stimulating experience important for social connectedness, well-being, and inner-strength. Communication deteriorated between baseline and follow-up in the hospital setting, but improved in the residential care setting.","The findings highlight the potential for creative aging within dementia care, the benefits of art activities and the influence of the environment. We encourage dementia care providers and arts and cultural services to work toward embedding art activities within routine care provision."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Windle","ForeName":"Gill","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Services Development Centre,School of Healthcare Sciences,Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,Wales."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joling","ForeName":"Karlijn J","Initials":"KJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine,Amsterdam Public Health research institute,VU University Medical Center,Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Howson-Griffiths","ForeName":"Teri","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Drama Department,Liverpool Screen School,Liverpool John Moores University,Liverpool,England."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Services Development Centre,School of Healthcare Sciences,Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,Wales."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Catrin Hedd","Initials":"CH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Services Development Centre,School of Healthcare Sciences,Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,Wales."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Peter M","Initials":"PM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics,VU University Medical Center,Amsterdam,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Newman","ForeName":"Andrew","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Arts and Cultures,Newcastle University,Newcastle-Upon-Tyne,England."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parkinson","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Arts for Health,The Manchester School of Art,Manchester Metropolitan University,Manchester,England."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Art Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"},{"DescriptorName":"Wales"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["art","dementia","intervention","longitudinal","mixed-methods","quality of life","well-being"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29113610","S1041610217002162","10.1017\/S1041610217002162"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28379646","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"04","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"33","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"The occurrence and persistence of thoughts of suicide, self-harm and death in family caregivers of people with dementia: a longitudinal data analysis over 2\u00a0years.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"263-270"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.4708","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Family caregivers of people with dementia often report high levels of stress and depression, but little is known about those who contemplate suicide or self-harm.

Interventions that effectively support caregivers may prevent or delay patient institutionalization and hence be cost-effective. However, evidence about the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a family meetings intervention for family caregivers of dementia patients in comparison with usual care over a period of 12 months.","The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective alongside a randomized trial of 192 primary caregivers with community-dwelling dementia patients. Outcome measures included the Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALY) of caregivers and patients and the incidence of depression and anxiety disorders in caregivers. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputations. Bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty around the cost-differences and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The bootstrapped cost-effect pairs were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane and used to estimate cost-effectiveness curves.","No significant differences in costs and effects between the groups were found. At 12 months, total costs per patient and primary caregiver dyad were substantial: \u20ac77,832 for the intervention group and \u20ac75,201 for the usual care group (adjusted mean difference per dyad \u20ac4,149, 95% CI -13,371 to 21,956, ICER 157,534). The main cost driver was informal care (66% of total costs), followed by patients' day treatment and costs of hospital and long-term care facility admissions (23%).

The objective of this study was to determine whether a family meetings intervention was superior to usual care in postponing nursing home placement of patients with dementia.","A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia living at home at enrolment and their primary family caregiver. Dyads of caregivers and patients were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n = 96) or usual care (n = 96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions with the primary caregiver and four family counseling sessions that included family members and friends. The primary outcome measure was the time until institutionalization of the patient. Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were performed. Survival analyses were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.","During 18 months follow-up 23 of 96 relatives with dementia of caregivers in the intervention group and 18 of 96 relatives with dementia of caregivers in the usual care group were institutionalized. No significant difference between the intervention and the usual care group was found in time until institutionalization (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 2.74). The per-protocol analysis revealed no significant effect either (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.57), although the number of placements among the adherers was relatively low (9.4%). A subgroup effect was found for patients' age, with a significantly higher risk of institutionalization for 'younger' patients in the intervention group compared with the usual care group (adjusted HR = 4.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 22.13).","This family meetings intervention for primary caregivers of patients with dementia did not postpone patient institutionalization more than usual

Ways of helping caregivers deal with these problems included problem clarification from the perspectives of the key players. An important barrier was reluctance to be helped. This was dealt with by acknowledging caregivers' need for control over situations. Additional effects of participation in the NYUCI observed by the counselors were reduction of anger and awareness of more and new options for dealing with dementia.","Person- or family-centered care offers new perspectives on problems that are seemingly unmanageable.

Data from medical records in 2001-2007 were analyzed.","Two hundred eighteen spouses of patients with dementia and 353 age and gender-matched spouses of nondemented persons.","Seventy-one general practices in the Netherlands with a listed source population of 320,309 patients.","Incidence rates (IRs) per 1,000 person-years and hazard ratios (HRs) of depression and anxiety; prescription rates (per 1,000 person-years) for antidepressants and anxiolytics.","A new episode of depression was diagnosed in 18 spouses and 7 comparison spouses (IRs of 18.8\/1,000 person-years and 4.4\/1,000 person-years, respectively). Spouses of patients with dementia were far more likely to be diagnosed with depression than the comparison spouses (HR, 4.16; 95% CI: 1.73-9.98). Spouses did not have a higher incidence of anxiety than the comparison group (HR, 1.26; 95% CI: 0.58-2.71). The prescription rates for both antidepressants and anxiolytics were significantly higher for spouses than for the comparison group.","The spouses of patients with dementia have a fourfold higher risk of a diagnosis of depression than the spouses of nondemented persons. The authors could not establish this for anxiety."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joling","ForeName":"Karlijn J","Initials":"KJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, Institute for Research in Extramural Medicine, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. k.joling@vumc.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Hout","ForeName":"Hein P J","Initials":"HP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schellevis","ForeName":"Francois G","Initials":"FG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der Horst","ForeName":"Henriette E","Initials":"HE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scheltens","ForeName":"Philip","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Knol","ForeName":"Dirk L","Initials":"DL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Marwijk","ForeName":"Harm W J","Initials":"HW"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"9309609","ISSNLinking":"1064-7481"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Anti-Anxiety Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antidepressive Agents"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Anti-Anxiety Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Antidepressive Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cohort Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Comorbidity"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Incidence"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Referral and Consultation","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"4","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20104070","10.1097\/JGP.0b013e3181bf9f0f","00019442-201002000-00007"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18208607","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2318","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Jan","Day":"21"}},"Title":"BMC geriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Geriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"(Cost)-effectiveness of family meetings on indicated prevention of anxiety and depressive symptoms and disorders of primary family caregivers of patients with dementia: design of a randomized controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1471-2318-8-2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Dementia is a major public health problem with enormous costs to society and major consequences for both patients and their relatives. Family members of persons with dementia provide much of the care for older adults with dementia in the community. Caring for a demented relative is not easy and fraught with emotional strain, distress, and physical exhaustion. Family caregivers of dementia patients have an extremely high risk developing affective disorders such as major depression and anxiety disorder. Family meetings appear to be among the most powerful psychosocial interventions to reduce depression in caregivers. An American landmark study reported substantial beneficial effects of a multifaceted intervention where family meetings had a central place on depression in family caregivers as well as on delay of institutionalization of patients. These effects were not replicated in other countries yet. We perform the first trial comparing only structured family meetings with significant others versus usual care among primary family caregivers of community dwelling demented patients and measure the effectiveness on both depression and anxiety in the primary caregiver, both on disorder and symptom levels.","In this randomized controlled trial effectiveness as well as cost-effectiveness of family meetings is evaluated. The intervention group receives four family meetings with family and close friends of the primary family caregiver of a community dwelling patient with a clinical diagnosis of dementia. Dyads of patients and their primary caregiver are followed up to one year after baseline assessment. The main outcome measures are the incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms in caregivers is measured by validated self report instruments: the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for depression and the anxiety scales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scales (HADS) for anxiety. The economic evaluation is performed from a societal perspective.","By evaluating the effectiveness of only structured family meetings organized in the Netherlands, this study will contribute to the existing literature about the value of psychosocial interventions for dementia caregivers.","Dutch Trial Registry
