As dementia progresses, families increasingly rely on help from the wider community and formal support.","this article reports on a secondary analysis of qualitative data from focus groups and individual interviews with people with dementia and their carers in the North of England. In total, 65 people with dementia and 82 carers took part in the research: 26 in interviews and 121 in focus groups. Focus group and interview audio recordings were transcribed verbatim. A qualitative, inductive, thematic approach was taken for data analysis.","the article applies the metaphor of scaffolding to deepen understanding of the strategies used by families. Processes of scaffolding were evident across the data where families, communities, professionals and services worked together to support everyday life for people with dementia. Within this broad theme of scaffolding were three sub-themes characterising the experiences of families living with dementia: doing things together; evolving strategies; and fragility and fear of the future.","families with dementia are resourceful but do need increasing support (scaffolding) to continue to live as well as possible as dementia progresses. More integrated, proactive work is required from services that recognises existing scaffolds and provides appropriate support before informal strategies become unsustainable; thus enabling people with dementia to live well for longer."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017.

We explore both discourses, placing them in the context of a successful ageing paradigm, highlighting the complex nature of dementia and the risks associated with the emergence of these arguably competing discourses. Specifically, we explore this dichotomy in the context of societal understandings and responses to dementia. We argue for an acceptance of the fluid nature of the dementia experience, and the importance of an understanding that recognises the multiple realities of dementia necessary for social inclusion to occur. Such an acceptance requires that, rather than defend one position over another, the current discourse on dementia is challenged and problematised so that a more nuanced understanding of dementia may emerge; one that fully accepts the paradoxical nature of this complex condition.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McParland","ForeName":"Patricia","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelly","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Nursing, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health, Nursing and Midwifery, University of the West of Scotland, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Sociol Health Illn","NlmUniqueID":"8205036","ISSNLinking":"0141-9889"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["classification","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatrics"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ageing","dementia\/Alzheimer's","discourse","social change"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28177143","10.1111\/1467-9566.12438"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26786566","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"08","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"08","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1748-3743","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"11","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"International journal of older people nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Older People Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Living with dementia in hospital wards: a comparative study of staff perceptions of practice and observed patient experience.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"94-106"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/opn.12102","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To ascertain the experiences, attitudes and knowledge of staff working in two Maltese hospital wards and the observed experiences of people with dementia living there.

Additionally, the collaborative nature of community gardening may encourage the development of a sense of community, thereby enhancing social integration. Despite increasing evidence supporting its therapeutic value for people with dementia in residential care, the benefits of horticultural therapy have yet to be transposed into a community setting.

The review was commissioned to support an inspection regime and identifies the current state of scientific knowledge regarding appropriate and effective services in relation to a set of key outcomes derived from Scottish policy, inspection practice and standards. However, emphases on care at home and reduction in the use of institutional long term care are common to many international policy contexts and welfare regimes.","Systematic searches of relevant electronic bibliographic databases crossing medical, psychological and social scientific literatures (CINAHL, IngentaConnect, Medline, ProQuest, PsychINFO and Web of Science) in November 2012 were followed by structured review and full-text evaluation processes, the latter using methodology-appropriate quality assessment criteria drawing on established protocols.","Of 131 publications evaluated, 56 were assessed to be of 'high' quality, 62 of 'medium' quality and 13 of 'low' quality. Evaluations identified weaknesses in many published accounts of research, including lack of methodological detail and failure to evidence conclusions. Thematic analysis revealed multiple gaps in the evidence base, including in relation to take-up and use of self-directed support by people with dementia, use of rapid response teams and other multidisciplinary approaches, use of technology to support community-dwelling people with dementia, and support for people without access to unpaid or informal support.","In many areas, policy and practice developments are proceeding on a limited evidence base. Key issues affecting substantial numbers of existing studies include: poorly designed and overly narrowly focused studies; variability and uncertainty in outcome measurement; lack of focus on the perspectives of people with dementia and supporters; and failure to understanding the complexities of living with dementia, and of the kinds of multifactorial interventions needed to provide holistic and effective support.

understandable, reinforce personal identity and maintain their abilities. The focus on supporting people with dementia to live well has omitted considering the needs or wishes for a supportive physical environment of those who are nearing the end of their lives. Using a combination of focus groups and a Delphi survey, this study explored the views of people with dementia, family carers and professionals on what aspects of the physical environment would be important to support a good quality of life to the very end.","Three focus groups were carried out in three cities along the East Coast of Australia using a discussion guide informed by a literature review. Focus groups comprised recently bereaved family carers of people with dementia (FG1), people with dementia and family carers of people with dementia (FG2) and practitioners caring for people with dementia nearing or at the end of their lives (FG3). Focus group conversations were audio-recorded with participants' consent. Audio files were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically to identify environmental features that could contribute to achieving the goal of providing a comfortable life to the end. A list of design features derived from analysis of focus group transcripts was distributed to a range of experts in the dementia field and a consensus sought on their appropriateness. From this, a set of features to inform the design of environments for people with dementia nearing the end of life was defined.","Eighteen people took part in three focus groups: two with dementia, eleven current or recently bereaved family carers and five practitioners. There were differences in opinion on what were important environmental considerations. People with dementia and family carers identified comfort through engagement, feeling at home, a calm environment, privacy and dignity and use of technology to remain connected as important. For practitioners, design to facilitate duty of care and institutional influences on their practice were salient themes. Twenty one experts in the dementia field took part in the survey to agree a consensus on the desirable features derived from analysis of focus group transcripts, with fifteen features agreed.","The fifteen features are compatible with the design principles for people with dementia who are mobile, but include a stronger focus on sensory engagement. We suggest that considering these features as part of a continuum of care will support good practice and offer those with dementia the opportunity to live well until the end and give their families a more positive experience in the last days of their lives together."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fleming","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing, University of Wollongong, Northfields Avenue, Wollongong, Australia. rfleming@uow.edu.au."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelly","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bournemouth University Dementia Institute, Bournemouth, UK. fkelly@bournemouth.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stillfried","ForeName":"Gillian","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing, University of Wollongong, Northfields Avenue, Wollongong, Australia. gillians@uow.edu.au."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"12"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Palliat Care","NlmUniqueID":"101088685","ISSNLinking":"1472-684X"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Australia"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Delphi Technique"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Environment"},{"DescriptorName":"Environment Design"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2015","Month":"03","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2015","Month":"04","Day":"30"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"5","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"5","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25962895","10.1186\/s12904-015-0026-y","10.1186\/s12904-015-0026-y","PMC4436026"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2000 Aug;40(4):397-416","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10961029"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2000 Oct;32(4):1008-15","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11095242"}},{"Citation":"Nurse Educ Today. 2005 May;25(4):326-32","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15885857"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2006 Dec;18(4):613-21","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16618375"}},{"Citation":"Health Soc Care Community. 2006 Jul;14(4):341-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16787485"}},{"Citation":"World Health Organ Tech Rep Ser. 1990;804:1-75","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"1702248"}},{"Citation":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen. 2010 Feb;25(1):46-50","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19332652"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2009 Jul;13(4):512-20","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19629775"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2010 Nov;22(7):1084-96","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20478095"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2011 Jul 1;15(5):548-56","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21815846"}},{"Citation":"Palliat Med. 2014 Mar;28(3):197-209","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23828874"}},{"Citation":"Maturitas. 2014 Apr;77(4):305-10","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24495787"}},{"Citation":"Dementia (London). 2016 Mar;15(2):162-80","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24535818"}},{"Citation":"Br J Psychiatry. 2014 Dec;205(6):436-42","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25452601"}},{"Citation":"Health Informatics J. 2016 Dec;22(4):854-866","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26276794"}},{"Citation":"Anthropol Med. 2015 Dec;22(3):333-5","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"27454565"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 1997;9 Suppl 1:173-6;

This paper reports on key findings from an evaluation of a post-diagnostic support pilot project in Scotland addressing local service gaps, namely information provision, emotional and practical support and maintaining community links. Twenty-seven participants (14 people newly diagnosed with dementia and 13 family carers) were interviewed at two time points: T1 shortly after joining the pilot project and T2 approximately six months later, to ascertain their views on existing services and the support offered by the pilot project. A comparative thematic analysis revealed that the project facilitated increased independence (associated with increased motivation and self-confidence) of people with dementia. The project illustrates what can be achieved if resources are targeted at providing individualised post-diagnostic support, particularly where there are service delivery gaps.

The findings highlight areas that should be considered by care home teams involved in the build of a new home or the redevelopment of an existing care home."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Services Development Centre, School of Applied Social Science, University of Stirling, Stirling, UK. anthea.innes@stir.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelly","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dincarslan","ForeName":"Ozlem","Initials":"O"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Environment Design"},{"DescriptorName":"Facility Design and Construction"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Facility Environment"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Northern Ireland"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Scotland"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"8","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"8","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"13","Hour":"0","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21815846","10.1080\/13607863.2011.556601"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"20882781","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"11","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"17"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-0795","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Nursing older people","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Older People"},"ArticleTitle":"The assessment and management of pain in people with dementia in care homes.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"29-35"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Pain is an unpleasant, subjective sensation and a universal human experience. However, under-recognition of pain in people with dementia is common; with verbal and behavioural expressions of pain misunderstood or not recognised and therefore untreated, to the detriment of the person with dementia. Care staff's success or otherwise in recognising, assessing and managing pain can have far-reaching consequences for the wellbeing of people with dementia. This article examines research on pain and pain in people with dementia and offers practical guidance on recognising, assessing and managing pain and on advocating for people with dementia who are no longer able to articulate their pain."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cunningham","ForeName":"Colm","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Services Development Centre, University of Stirling."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McClean","ForeName":"William","Initials":"W"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelly","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Nurs Older People","NlmUniqueID":"101084156","ISSNLinking":"1472-0795"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Continuing"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Pain","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Pain Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Pain Measurement"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Patient Relations"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"10","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"10","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"11","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20882781","10.7748\/nop2010.09.22.7.29.c7947"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19534172","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"09","Day":"08"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"06","Day":"18"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-0795","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Nursing older people","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Older People"},"ArticleTitle":"Face to face.
