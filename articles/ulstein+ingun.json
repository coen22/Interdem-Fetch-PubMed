Few studies have described the challenges and burdens connected with everyday life and in relation to suitable nursing home placement that are faced by family caregivers.","This study used a descriptive and explorative design. Eleven semi-structured interviews with family caregivers of patients from special units in four nursing homes were conducted in 2014. Data were analysed based on Kvale and Brinkmann's three contexts of interpretation: self-understanding, common sense and theoretical understanding. Checklist for qualitative studies: Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) http:\/\/www.equator-network.org\/reporting-guidelines\/srqr\/ RESULTS: Two central themes were derived from the data: changes in behaviour and personality were perceived as incomprehensible, frightening and increasingly difficult to manage. Family caregivers experienced challenges in finding suitable care facilities when they were not able to continue providing home care. Due to behavioural disturbances and lack of relevant competencies among health personnel, family members were often moved between nursing homes.","Pronounced personality and behavioural disturbances such as tactlessness and aggression in a family member with dementia are experienced by caregivers as stressful and burdensome and may lead to feelings of shame and guilt. A lack of suitable care facilities adds to the stress and difficulties of the families and entails an additional and unresolved burden.","The study reveals a need for more knowledge among those organising health services as well as healthcare professional dealing with this patient category to ease the burden on next of kin."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2020 The Authors.

While intervention studies have revealed promising results on caregiver burden, distress, and depression, there is a lack of knowledge about how caregivers' perceived relationship with their ill family member influences the burden of care. This study examined whether a psychosocial intervention influenced this perceived relationship from the caregivers' perspective. We also explored whether the caregivers' perception of the care receiver's attitude and behavior changed over time, and whether caregiver stress and mood differed following the intervention.","The participating caregivers and care receivers were randomly assigned to a psychosocial intervention comprising education about dementia, counselling and group sessions, or to treatment as usual. The study investigated caregivers' experience of expressed emotion using the Felt Expressed Emotion Rating Scale (FEERS), a self-report questionnaire that captures caregivers' perception of criticism (CC) and emotional over-involvement (EOI) exhibited by the family members with dementia.","A total of 208 dyads were enrolled in the study. There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in the studied variables. Caregivers' perception of CC and EOI was low but fluctuated somewhat, whereas their mood and stress level were stable during the follow-up period.","According to the FEERS, the intervention did not influence caregivers' perception of CC and EOI, and there was no difference between the intervention and control groups regarding caregivers' perceived relationship. Despite the increased symptoms of dementia, caregivers' level of distress and mood remained stable, and they seemed to maintain a positive perception of the quality of their relationship with the care receiver.","Clinical.Trials.gov Sept. 2009,

prognosis and mainly unknown pathophysiology. Heritability estimates exceed 30% but few genetic risk variants have been identified. Here we investigated common genetic variants associated with DLB in a large European multisite sample. We performed a genome wide association study in Norwegian and European cohorts of 720 DLB cases and 6490 controls and included 19 top-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in an additional cohort of 108 DLB cases and 75545 controls from Iceland. Overall the study included 828 DLB cases and 82035 controls. Variants in the ASH1L\/GBA (Chr1q22) and APOE \u03b54 (Chr19) loci were associated with DLB surpassing the genome-wide significance threshold (p\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00d7\u200910). One additional genetic locus previously linked to psychosis in Alzheimer's disease, ZFPM1 (Chr16q24.2), showed suggestive association with DLB at p-value\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910. We report two susceptibility loci for DLB at genome-wide significance, providing insight into etiological factors. These findings highlight the complex relationship between the genetic architecture of DLB and other neurodegenerative disorders."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rongve","ForeName":"Arvid","Initials":"A","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0476-4134","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Haugesund

intervention of physical activity and music therapy could reduce anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and aggression among individuals with severe dementia. An exploratory design was used to evaluate a combined intervention of physical activity, music therapy, and daily walking. Interventions were systematically implemented for 8 weeks. Target groups were individuals with dementia with frontal lobe symptoms in institutional care. Primary outcome measure was the Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist (BVC). Four men and two women (mean age = 84.3 years) and their primary caretakers (n = 6) participated. The most prominent symptoms among participants at baseline were confusion, irritability, and verbal threats. The individual BVC total scores indicated significant improvements (p = 0.03). Implementation of individualized music therapy combined with increased physical activity for 8 weeks was a feasible intervention that reduced anxiety, restlessness, irritability, and aggression in the current study.

Yet these only explain a small proportion of the genetic variance, indicating that undiscovered loci remain. Here, we performed a large genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy, based on parental diagnoses, showed strong genetic correlation with AD (r\u2009=\u20090.81). Meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, implicating 215 potential causative genes. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver, and microglia). Gene-set analyses indicate biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomization results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in identifying the genetic factors that contribute to AD risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jansen","ForeName":"Iris E","Initials":"IE","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1901-8131","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Complex Trait Genetics, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Savage","ForeName":"Jeanne E","Initials":"JE","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2034-8341","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Complex Trait Genetics, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Watanabe","ForeName":"Kyoko","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Complex Trait Genetics, Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University, Amsterdam, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bryois","ForeName":"Julien","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Williams","ForeName":"Dylan M","Initials":"DM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Steinberg","ForeName":"Stacy","Initials":"S","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7726-5152","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"deCODE Genetics\/Amgen, Reykjavik, Iceland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sealock","ForeName":"Julia","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Interdisciplinary Graduate Program, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Karlsson","ForeName":"Ida K","Initials":"IK","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."},{"Affiliation":"Institute of Gerontology and Aging Research Network-J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping (ARN-J), School of Health and Welfare, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"H\u00e4gg","ForeName":"Sara","Initials":"S","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2452-1500","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Athanasiu","ForeName":"Lavinia","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"NORMENT, K.G.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AD cases and controls of European descent from the multi-center DemGene network across Norway and two independent European cohorts. In a two-stage process, we first performed a meta-analysis using GWAS results from 2,893 AD cases and 6,858 cognitively normal controls from Norway and 25,580 cases and 48,466 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), denoted the discovery sample. Second, we selected the top hits (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910) from the discovery analysis for replication in an Icelandic cohort consisting of 5,341 cases and 110,008 controls. We identified a novel genomic region with genome-wide significant association with AD on chromosome 4 (combined analysis OR\u2009=\u20091.07, p\u2009=\u20092.48 x 10). This finding implicated HS3ST1, a gene expressed throughout the brain particularly in the cerebellar cortex. In addition, we identified IGHV1-68 in the discovery sample, previously not associated with AD. We also associated USP6NL\/ECHDC3 and BZRAP1-AS1 to AD, confirming findings from a follow-up transethnic study. These new gene loci provide further evidence for AD as a polygenic disorder, and suggest new mechanistic pathways that warrant further investigation."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Witoelar","ForeName":"Aree","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"NORMENT,

Alzheimer's disease (AD), including oxidative stress and DNA damage. We propose that genotoxic stress and DNA repair responses influence neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we focus on nucleotide excision repair (NER). Real-time qPCR and mass spectrometry were employed to determine the expression levels of selected NER components. The mRNA levels of the genes encoding the NER proteins RAD23B, RPA1, ERCC1, PCNA and LIG3 as well as the NER-interacting base excision repair protein MPG in blood and brain tissue from four brain regions in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls (HC), were assessed. NER mRNA levels were significantly higher in brain tissue than in blood. Further, LIG3 mRNA levels in the frontal cortex was higher in AD versus HC, while mRNA levels of MPG and LIG3 in entorhinal cortex and RPA1 in the cerebellum were lower in AD versus HC. In blood, RPA1 and ERCC1 mRNA levels were lower in AD patients than in HC. Alterations in gene expression of NER components between brain regions were associated with AD, connecting DNA repair to AD pathogenesis and suggesting a distinct role for NER in the brain.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

These patients demonstrate a decline in social conduct, and\/or language aphasias, apathy, and loss of insight that is gradual and progressive. Preservation of dignity seems to be highly relevant both before and after admission to different types of institutionalized care, but the research is scant. From the perspective of close relatives, this study aims to develop knowledge related to dignified or undignified care of patients with FTD and similar conditions.","A qualitative, descriptive, and explorative design were employed to address the aims of this study. We interviewed nine relatives of people with FTD and similar conditions living in nursing homes, and two relatives of people living at home but attending day center 5\u00a0days a week.","Relatives described the transition from being a close relative to someone who had little influence or knowledge of what constituted the care and the daily life of their loved ones. According to relatives' descriptions, patients are deprived of dignity in various ways: through limited interaction with peers and close relatives, limited confirmation of identity through staff who know them well, lack of possibilities for making autonomous decisions or entertaining meaningful roles or activities. Examples provided from the day care centres show how dignity is maintained through identity-strengthening activities conducted in different places, under various kinds of supervision and care, and together with people representing different roles and functions.","Maintaining a link with the world outside the institution, through closer cooperation between the institution and family members,

between caregivers and care receivers, defined as home-dwelling family members with dementia. We used a self-rating questionnaire, the Felt Expressed Emotion Rating Scale (FEERS; 6 simple questions), to measure caregiver perceptions of the care receiver's criticisms (CCs) and emotional overinvolvement (EOI) toward the caregiver. We performed factor analyses to rank single items on the FEERS pertaining to CC and EOI. We included 208 caregiver\/care receiver pairs. Logistic regression analyses tested associations between FEERS items and caregiver and care receiver variables. The main contributors to caregiver perceptions of CC were the caregiver's own distress and the amount of time spent with the care receiver. Socially distressed caregivers perceived the care receiver as emotionally overinvolved. When offering a psychosocial intervention, a tailored program should target the caregiver's perceived relationship with the family member and the caregiver's distress. The program should also endeavor to give the caretaker more opportunities for leisure time."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bj\u00f8rge","ForeName":"Heidi","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kvaal","ForeName":"Kari","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Faculty of Health, Institute of Nursing and Health Promotion, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Oslo, Norway."},{"Affiliation":"3 Faculty of Public Health, Hedmark University of Applied Sciences, Elverum, Norway."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sm\u00e5stuen","ForeName":"Milada Cvancarova","Initials":"MC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"2 Faculty of Health, Institute of Nursing and Health Promotion, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, Oslo, Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ulstein","ForeName":"Ingun","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"1 Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway."},{"Affiliation":"4 Department of Psychiatry of Old Age, Oslo University Hospital trust, Ullev\u00e5l, Asker, Norway."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"01","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen","NlmUniqueID":"101082834","ISSNLinking":"1533-3175"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Expressed Emotion"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Relations","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","expressed emotion","family caregiver","relationship"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"4","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"4","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28423936","10.1177\/1533317517691121"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27716664","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"55","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2017"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"Normal Vitamin Levels and Nutritional Indices in Alzheimer's Disease Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia with Normal Body Mass Indexes.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"717-725"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Evidence supports an association between vitamin deficiencies and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). If vitamin deficiencies are causative for AD development, they should be detectable during very early stages of AD. Here we investigated nutritional factors among home-living patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD, compared to healthy controls. Our study included 73 patients with AD (25 with MCI, 48 with dementia) and 63 cognitively intact age-matched controls. All participants underwent cognitive testing, somatic examination, and measurements of vitamins A, B1, B6, folate, B12, C, D, and E, and F2-\u03b1-isoprostane. Results are given as mean (SD). MMSE scores were 29.1 (1.0) for healthy controls, 27.4 (1.8) for patients with MCI, and 24.3 (3.2) for patients with dementia. Vitamin concentrations for the these groups, respectively, were as follows: B1 (nmol\/l), 157 (29), 161 (35), and 161 (32); B6 (nmol\/l), 57 (63), 71 (104), and 58 (44); folate (mmol\/l), 23 (9), 26 (10), and 23 (11); B12 (pmol\/l), 407 (159), 427 (116), and 397 (204); C (\u03bcmol\/l), 63 (18), 61 (16), and 63 (29); A (\u03bcmol\/l), 2.3 (0.6), 2.2 (0.5), and 2.3 (0.5); E (\u03bcmol\/l), 36 (6.3), 36 (6.9), and 36 (8.2); 25-OH vitamin D (nmol\/l), 65 (18), 61 (19), and 65 (20); and 8-iso-PGF\u03b1 (pg\/ml), 64 (27); 60 (19), and 66 (51).

Family caregivers (n\u2009=\u200915; 11 women and four men; age 39-92 years) of people with dementia participated in semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed according to Kvale and Brinkman. The analysis identified one overarching theme, experiences of companionship, and four subthemes, namely experiences of loss and loneliness; role change; communication alteration; and caring considerations and coping resources. The caregivers described their companionship with the family member, including warm feelings of reciprocity, as well as contradictory feelings, such as feelings of being burdened. They expressed a desire to continue caring for their relative and emphasized the positive aspects of their relationship. Knowledge about dementia, together with a good relationship with their ill family member, facilitated the caring role.

The average age was 74.9\u2009years (SD\u2009=\u20097.8). Caregiver distress was rated by the Relative Stress Scale. Diagnosis of the person receiving care was based on a comprehensive standardised assessment program (International Classification of Diseases, Revision 10 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fourth edition). Additional data collected from people receiving care were neuropsychiatric symptoms, comorbidity and activities of daily living (ADL) score. Linear regression analyses were applied, first unadjusted and then in stepwise-adjusts in addition to descriptive analyses.","Caregivers to people with AD (20.2%) and 40% of caregivers for people with DLB experienced moderate or high caregiver burden with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders in the early stage of dementia.

Gender differences in symptom profile, living conditions, coping style and response might affect the outcome of psychosocial interventions (PSIs).","Our aim was to review gender differences in the available high-quality phase III trials on PSI in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) by considering the gender ratio in the investigated samples.","Randomized controlled trials published in 2000-2012 were stepwise analyzed by statistically testing the representativeness of the gender ratio and examining reported gender differences.","Forty-five studies (62% of 73 studies) reported gender ratios for each subsample and were included. In these studies, females were underrepresented in the control groups.

dementia. Neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes with symptoms that occur together and have common neurobiological correlates have been identified. There are scarce data regarding the comparison of the pattern of the neuropsychiatric sub-syndromes in distinct ethnical and cultural populations. We aim at comparing the pattern of the NPS, and the factor analysis of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10) in two samples of outpatients with dementia living in Brazil and Norway.","This is a cross-sectional study. The sample consists of 168 Brazilian and 155 Norwegian demented patients from psychogeriatric facilities and community-based educational programs. Brazilian patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (63.7%), vascular dementia (15.5%), or mixed dementia (20.8%), whereas the diagnoses of Norwegian patients were Alzheimer's disease (97.4%) and mixed dementia (2.6%). Principal component analysis with the Varimax rotation was used for factor analysis of the NPI-10.","Apathy (80.4 %), agitation\/aggression (45.8%), and aberrant motor behavior (45.8%) were the most common symptoms in the Brazilian sample. Apathy (72.3%), dysphoria (61.9%), and anxiety (52.3%) were the most frequent symptoms in the Norwegian sample. Factor analysis of the NPI-10 revealed three syndromes for the Brazilian (Psychosis, Mood, Psychomotor) and Norwegian (Psychosis, Mood, Frontal) groups.","The frequency of individual NPS may differ among distinct populations. However, Psychosis and Depression are common sub-syndromes in diverse ethnical and cultural patients with dementia.

(GHQ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and to establish a cut-off score for RSS in order to distinguish carers with symptoms of psychiatric disorders from those without.","One hundred and ninety-four carers of 194 patients suffering from dementia according to ICD-10 were included in the study. Burden of care was assessed by the 15-items RSS, and psychiatric symptoms by means of the GHQ-30 and the 30-items GDS. A case score above 5 on GHQ and above 13 on GDS were used to define carers with probable psychiatric morbidity. Sensitivity (SS), specificity (SP), accuracy and likelihood ratio for a positive test (LR+) were calculated for different cut-points of the RSS.","Fifty-six percent of the carers had a GHQ score above 5, and 22% had a GDS score above 13. A two-step cluster analysis using 192 of the 194 carers, identified three groups of carers; a low risk group for psychiatric morbidity (LRG), 82 carers with GHQ < or = 5 and GDS < or = 13; a medium risk group (MRG), 69 carers with GHQ > 5 and GDS < or = 13; and a high-risk group (HRG), 40 carers with GHQ > 5 and GDS > 13. The optimal RSS cut-off to distinguish between the LRG and the others was > 23 (SS 0.72, SP 0.82, accuracy 0.76, LR + 4.0), whereas the optimal cut-off to separate the HRG from the others was >30 (SS 0.74, SP 0.87, accuracy 0.84, LR + 5.7).","The RSS is a useful instrument to stratify carers according to their risk of psychiatric morbidity."],"CopyrightInformation":"(c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ulstein","ForeName":"Ingun","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Norwegian Centre for Dementia Research, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. ingun.ulstein@nordemens.no"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wyller","ForeName":"Torgeir Bruun","Initials":"TB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Engedal","ForeName":"Knut","Initials":"K"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Analysis of Variance"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost of Illness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Family"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Likelihood Functions"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"ROC Curve"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk"},{"DescriptorName":"Sensitivity and Specificity"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"diagnosis"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"10","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"1","Day":"11","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"10","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17044130","10.1002\/gps.1660"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16988960","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"10","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"12","Day":"21"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"The relative stress scale, a useful instrument to identify various aspects of carer burden in dementia?","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"61-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To identify carer and patient characteristics associated with various aspects of burden of care.","The burden on 196 carers, each caring for one patient with dementia, was rated by means of the Relative Stress Scale (RSS).
