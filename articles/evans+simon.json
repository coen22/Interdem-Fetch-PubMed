Previous fMRI work with this task has used block designs: this study is the first to image an extended (6-minute) RVIP task. Participants were 26 carriers of the APOE \u03b54 allele, and 26 non carriers (aged 18-28). Pupil diameter was measured throughout, as an index of cognitive effort. We compared activity to RVIP task hits to hits on a control task (with similar visual parameters and response requirements but no working memory load): this contrast showed activity in medial frontal, inferior and superior parietal, temporal and visual cortices, consistent with previous work, demonstrating that meaningful neural data can be extracted from the RVIP task over an extended interval and using an event-related design. Behavioural performance was not affected by genotype; however, a genotype by condition (experimental task\/control task) interaction on pupil diameter suggested that \u03b54 carriers deployed more effort to the experimental compared to the control task. fMRI results showed a condition by genotype interaction in the right hippocampal formation: only \u03b54 carriers showed downregulation of this region to experimental task hits versus control task hits. Experimental task beta values were correlated against hit rate: parietal correlations were seen in \u03b54 carriers only, frontal correlations in non-carriers only. The data indicate that, in the absence of behavioural differences, young adult \u03b54 carriers already show a different linkage between functional brain activity and behaviour, as well as aberrant hippocampal recruitment patterns. This may have relevance for genotype differences in cognitive ageing trajectories."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Evans","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S","Identifier":"0000-0001-7875-9445","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"School

Understanding how, where and when evaluators and researchers experience such challenges may help to identify fruitful approaches for future evaluation."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gray","ForeName":"Karen","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Evans","ForeName":"Simon Chester","Initials":"SC","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2919-8167","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffiths","ForeName":"Amanda","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schneider","ForeName":"Justine","Initials":"J","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5863-7747","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Art Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["arts","complexity","epistemology","evaluation","methodological challenges","methodology","methods"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28980477","10.1177\/1471301217734478"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28554224","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"29"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"'Now He Sings'.

The hospital environment is often disorientating for people with dementia and can be particularly distressing when a patient is admitted in an emergency. Subsequent ward moves can also be disruptive and confusing, especially if they take place out of hours. Two NHS trusts aimed to improve the experience for patients with dementia by addressing the physical environment along with practical aspects of care provision at different stages in the hospital journey. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King's Lynn NHS Foundation Trust in Norfolk enhanced its emergency department environment by redesigning four bays and an observation area to be dementia-friendly. The hospital has supported these changes by providing dementia awareness training for all staff in these areas. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust focused on minimising ward moves by implementing procedures to identify patients who should not be moved. Since introducing the new process, adherence has been good and there have been fewer ward moves.

Combined with a lack of activities and stimulation for patients with dementia in hospital, this can result in poor engagement and a disconnect between staff and patients. To improve these relationships and give staff more time with patients, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has introduced bay nursing for patients with dementia, where one nurse is responsible for monitoring a bay alongside a healthcare assistant for an entire shift.

Similarly, the needs of family carers can often be overlooked and staff do not always appreciate these needs at such a stressful time. This article illustrates how three NHS trusts have addressed these issues. To help staff get to know patients with dementia, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust has implemented a patient passport. Similarly, The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has implemented a carer passport that overcomes the restrictions imposed by hospital visiting hours. Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust also focused on carers, holding a workshop to elicit feedback on what was important to them.

Crucial for FITS into Practice to succeed was the allocation and protection of time for the DCC to attend training and supervision and to carry out implementation tasks in addition to their existing job role. Evaluation data showed that this was a substantial barrier to implementation in a small number of homes.","The FITS into practice programme was well evaluated and resulted in reduction in inappropriate anti-psychotic prescribing. Revisions to the intervention are suggested to maximise successful implementation."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn J","Initials":"DJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a

case study examples of the positive work achieved by trusts that participated in the RCN's development programme to improve dementia care in acute hospitals. This introductory article reports on the independent evaluation of the programme. The programme included a launch event, development days, site visits, ongoing support by the RCN lead and carer representatives and a conference to showcase service improvements. The evaluation drew on data from a survey, the site visits, trust action plans and a range of self-assessment tools for dementia care. The findings highlight substantial progress towards programme objectives and learning outcomes and suggest that the programme provided the focus, impetus and structure for trusts to make sustainable changes. It also equipped participants with the strategies and confidence to change practice. Recommendations are made for taking the programme forward.

This paper reports on timely diagnosis.","Evidence was reviewed from scientific, policy and qualitative research. An online questionnaire was completed by experts from 24 European Union countries detailing current practice. An iterative process with people with dementia, family carers and professionals was utilised to develop recommendations.","Advances in the technical aspects of diagnosis have changed what is understood by early diagnosis. Although research into preclinical stages is crucial, diagnosing at these very earliest stages is not recommended as regular practice. On balance, it is suggested that citizens should have access to accurate diagnosis at a time in the disease process when it can be of most benefit to them. The term timely diagnosis is used to reflect this. The diagnosis can help citizens and their families make sense of what is happening and make lifestyle changes and plans for the future. The central principles identified to maximise benefit and to reduce harm associated with diagnosis at an earlier stage included reducing stigma about dementia; respecting the rights of the individual; recognising that how the diagnosis is given will impact on subsequent adjustment and that post diagnostic support are required for the person and their family. Detailed recommendations are provided for timely detection, the diagnostic process, complex diagnoses, response to early cognitive changes and workforce.","The recommendations can be utilised at a local, national and European level to benchmark progress."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester, Worcester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"La Fontaine","ForeName":"Jenny","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Evans","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bray","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Saad","ForeName":"Karim","Initials":"K"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"01","Day":"24"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Accessibility","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health Services","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Public Health","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["ALCOVE","dementia","timely diagnosis"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2013","Month":"06","Day":"15"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"26"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"2","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24458456","10.1002\/gps.4066"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18411986","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"05","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-0795","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Nursing older people","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Older People"},"ArticleTitle":"Providing rehabilitation services for people with dementia through intermediate care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"26-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This article describes a Department of Health-funded study that mapped rehabilitation services--and examples of good practice--for older people with dementia in England.
