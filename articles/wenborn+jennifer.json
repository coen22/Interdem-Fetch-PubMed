These studies aimed to develop a reliable measure for assessing fidelity of delivery of the Community Occupational Therapy in Dementia-UK intervention (COTiD-UK) (Study 1) and measure fidelity of delivery of COTiD-UK across sessions, sites and occupational therapists (Study 2).","The studies used a longitudinal observational design nested within a multi-site randomised controlled trial. Where practicable, all intervention sessions were audio-recorded. Fidelity checklists and coding guidelines were developed, piloted and refined until good agreement was achieved between two coders. Ten percent of sessions were purposively sampled from 12 sites and 31 occupational therapists. Transcripts were coded using checklists developed in Study 1; 10% of sets of intervention session transcripts were double coded to ensure that agreement was maintained. Percentages of components that were delivered were calculated for each session, site and occupational therapist.","A reliable measure of fidelity of delivery for COTiD-UK was developed after several rounds of piloting and amendments. COTiD-UK was delivered with moderate fidelity across all six sessions (range: 52.4-75.5%). The mean range of fidelity varied across sites (26.7-91.2%) and occupational therapists (26.7-94.1%).","A reliable, systematic method for measuring fidelity of delivery of COTiD-UK was developed and applied, and can be adapted for use in similar interventions. As COTiD-UK was delivered with moderate fidelity, there is a reasonable degree of confidence that intervention effects were attributable to COTiD-UK."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Walton","ForeName":"Holly","Initials":"H","Identifier":"0000-0002-8746-059X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

experiences from one recently completed trial as an exemplar.","Research publications always cite participant numbers but the effort expended to achieve the sample size is rarely reported, even when the study involved recruiting a hard to reach population. A multisite study of a psychosocial intervention for people with dementia illustrates the challenges. This study recruited 468 'dyads' (a person with dementia and a family carer together) from 15 sites but the time taken to achieve this was longer than originally estimated. This led to a study extension and the need for additional sites. Recruitment data revealed that certain sites were more successful than others, but why? Can the knowledge gained be used to inform other studies?","Secondary analysis of routinely collected recruitment data from three purposefully selected sites was examined to understand the strategies used and identify successful approaches.","At all three sites, the pool of potential recruits funnelled to a few participants. It took two sites 18 months longer than the third to achieve recruitment numbers despite additional efforts. Explanations given by potential participants for declining to take part included ill health, reporting they were 'managing', time constraints, adjusting to a diagnosis of dementia and burden of study procedures.","Successful recruitment of people with dementia to studies, as one example of a hard to reach group, requires multiple strategies and close working between researchers and clinical services. It requires a detailed understanding of the needs and perspectives of the specific population and knowledge about how individuals can be supported to participate in research. Experiences of recruitment should be disseminated so that knowledge generated can be used to inform the planning and implementation of future research studies."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

capable to manage the caregiving task and is an important clinical concept in the caregiving literature. The aim of this review was to identify the factors, both positive and negative, associated with a caregiver's perception of their sense of competence.","A systematic review of the literature was conducted, retrieving both quantitative and qualitative papers from databases PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Medline. A quality assessment was conducted using the STROBE and CASP checklists, and the quality rating informed the inclusion of papers ensuring the evidence was robust. Narrative synthesis was employed to synthesize the findings and to generate an updated conceptual model of sense of competence.","Seventeen papers were included in the review, all of which were moderate to high quality. These included 13 quantitative, three mixed-methods and one qualitative study. Factors associated with sense of competence included: behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), caregiver depression, gratitude, and the ability to find meaning in caregiving.","The results of this review demonstrate that both positive and negative aspects of caring are associated with caregiver sense of competence. Positive and negative aspects of caregiving act in tandem to influence caregiver perception of their competence. The proposed model of sense of competence aims to guide future research and clinical interventions aimed at improving this domain but requires further testing, as due to the observational nature of

a common, challenging symptom affecting large numbers of people with dementia and impacting on quality of life (QoL). There is an urgent need for evidence-based, cost-effective psychosocial interventions to improve these outcomes, particularly in the absence of safe, effective pharmacological therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a person-centred care and psychosocial intervention incorporating an antipsychotic review, WHELD, on QoL, agitation, and antipsychotic use in people with dementia living in nursing homes, and to determine its cost.","This was a randomised controlled cluster trial conducted between 1 January 2013 and 30 September 2015 that compared the WHELD intervention with treatment as usual (TAU) in people with dementia living in 69 UK nursing homes, using an intention to treat analysis. All nursing homes allocated to the intervention received staff training in person-centred care and social interaction and education regarding antipsychotic medications (antipsychotic review), followed by ongoing delivery through a care staff champion model. The primary outcome measure was QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy). Secondary outcomes were agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]), neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version [NPI-NH]), antipsychotic use, global deterioration (Clinical Dementia Rating), mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia), unmet needs (Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly), mortality, quality of interactions (Quality of Interactions Scale [QUIS]), pain (Abbey Pain Scale), and cost. Costs were calculated using cost function figures compared with usual costs. In all, 847 people were randomised to WHELD or TAU, of whom 553 completed the 9-month randomised controlled trial. The intervention conferred a statistically significant improvement in QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy Z score 2.82, p = 0.0042; mean difference 2.54, SEM 0.88; 95% CI 0.81, 4.28; Cohen's D effect size 0.24). There were also statistically significant benefits in agitation (CMAI Z score 2.68, p = 0.0076; mean difference 4.27, SEM 1.59; 95% CI -7.39, -1.15; Cohen's D 0.23) and overall neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-NH Z score 3.52, p < 0.001; mean difference 4.55, SEM 1.28; 95% CI -7.07,-2.02; Cohen's D 0.30). Benefits were greatest in people with moderately severe dementia. There was a statistically significant benefit in positive care interactions as measured by QUIS (19.7% increase, SEM 8.94; 95% CI 2.12, 37.16, p = 0.03; Cohen's D 0.55). There were no statistically significant differences between WHELD and TAU for the other outcomes. A sensitivity analysis using a pre-specified imputation model confirmed statistically significant benefits in DEMQOL-Proxy, CMAI, and NPI-NH outcomes with the WHELD intervention. Antipsychotic drug use was at a low stable level in both treatment groups, and the intervention did not reduce use. The WHELD intervention reduced cost compared to TAU, and the benefits achieved were therefore associated with a cost saving. The main limitation was that antipsychotic review was based on augmenting processes within care homes to trigger medical review and did not in this study involve proactive primary care education. An additional limitation was the inherent challenge of assessing QoL in this patient group.","These findings suggest that the WHELD intervention confers benefits in terms of QoL, agitation, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, albeit with relatively small effect sizes, as well as cost saving in a model that can readily be implemented in nursing homes. Future work should consider how to facilitate sustainability of the intervention in this setting.","ISRCTN Registry

care has been fuelled by the urgent need to develop useful approaches to help support people with dementia at home. Also the low costs and wide availability of electronic devices make it more feasible to use electronic devices for the benefit of disabled persons. Information Communication Technology (ICT) devices designed to support people with dementia are usually referred to as Assistive Technology (AT) or Electronic Assistive Technology (EAT). By using AT in this review we refer to electronic assistive devices. A range of AT devices has been developed to support people with dementia and their carers to manage their daily activities and to enhance safety, for example electronic pill boxes, picture phones, or mobile tracking devices. Many are commercially available. However, the usefulness and user-friendliness of these devices are often poorly evaluated. Although reviews of (electronic) memory aids do exist, a systematic review of studies focusing on the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia is lacking. Such a review would guide people with dementia and their informal and professional carers in selecting appropriate AT devices.","Primary objectiveTo assess the efficacy of AT for memory support in people with dementia in terms of daily performance of personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), level of dependency, and admission to long-term care. Secondary objectiveTo assess the impact of AT on: users (autonomy, usefulness and user-friendliness, adoption of AT); cognitive function and neuropsychiatric symptoms; need for informal and formal care; perceived quality of life; informal carer burden, self-esteem and feelings of competence; formal carer work satisfaction, workload and feelings of competence; and adverse events.","We searched ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), on 10 November 2016. ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists of the CDCIG and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment and cognitive enhancement in healthy people. We also searched the following list of databases, adapting the search strategy as necessary: Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, up to May 2016; The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies; DBLP Computer Science Bibliography; HCI Bibliography: Human-Computer Interaction Resources; and AgeInfo, all to June 2016; PiCarta; Inspec; Springer Link Lecture Notes; Social Care Online; and IEEE Computer Society Digital Library, all to October 2016; J-STAGE: Japan Science and Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic; and Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (NCSTRL), both to November 2016; Computing Research Repository (CoRR) up to December 2016; and OT seeker; and ADEAR, both to February 2017. In addition, we searched Google Scholar and OpenSIGLE for grey literature.","We intended to review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clustered randomised trials with blinded assessment of outcomes that evaluated an electronic assistive device used with the single aim of supporting memory function in people diagnosed with dementia. The control interventions could either be 'care (or treatment) as usual' or non-technological psychosocial interventions (including interventions that use non-electronic assistive devices) also specifically aimed at supporting memory. Outcome measures included activities of daily living, level of dependency, clinical and care-related outcomes (for example admission to long-term care), perceived quality of life and well-being, and adverse events resulting from the use of AT; as well as the effects of AT on carers.","Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts identified by the search.","We identified no studies which met the inclusion criteria.","This review highlights the current lack of high-quality evidence to determine whether AT is effective in supporting people with dementia to manage their

The emerging constructs of self-efficacy, spirituality, resilience, rewards, gain, and meaning are in line with positive psychology theory.","There are some robust positive measures in existence for family caregivers of people living with dementia.

The English Dementia Strategy aims to improve the quality of service provision for people with dementia. This includes specific mention of improving the quality of life in care homes and as such includes objectives related to developing the workforce knowledge and skills. The Ladder to the Moon Culture Change Studio Engagement Programme (CCSEP) is a staff training approach based on the Positive Psychology framework that uses theatre- and film-based activities.","This study used a wait-list controlled design. However, the data analysis plan was amended to reflect difficulties in data collection, and a quasi-experimental case study approach was consequently utilised. Outcome measures for staff attitudes and beliefs were as follows: Sense of Competence in Dementia Care Staff; Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire; Job Satisfaction Index; Brief Learning Transfer System Inventory; and Scale of Positive and Negative Experience. The Quality of Interaction Schedule (QUIS) was used to observe changes in staff-resident interaction.","Fifty staff in two care homes completed the questionnaires and forty-one undertook formal CCSEP training. In Home A (nursing home), there was no significant change in any of the measures. In Home B (residential home), the QUIS showed an increase in positive interactions post intervention; a significant increase in the Building Relationship subscale of Sense of Competence; and a significant increase in staff sense of hopefulness towards people with dementia. The Brief Learning Transfer System Inventory showed a significant decrease post-intervention. The intervention did not significantly affect the happiness or job satisfaction of care home staff.","The results of this study provide tentative evidence about the efficacy of this staff training programme. Some significant improvement in staff attitudes to people with dementia, staff sense of competence and positive staff-resident interactions were found in one of two homes. It is likely that the organisational problems affecting the other care home limited the implementation and therefore efficacy of the intervention there. The results therefore suggest that when a supportive management structure is in place, CCSEP may be more effective in improving staff attitudes, sense of competence and interactions with residents."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guzm\u00e1n","ForeName":"Azucena","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinical Psychology Department, School of Health in Social Science, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wenborn","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Dementia Research Centre, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Swinson","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Research Centre, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, Nottingham University, Nothingham, UK."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Older People Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"101267281","ISSNLinking":"1748-3735"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Drama"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Inservice Training"},{"DescriptorName":"Motion Pictures"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Organizational Culture"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["care homes","dementia","film activities","positive psychology","staff training"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"22"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28185441","10.1111\/opn.12147"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27640872","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"07","Day":"30"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"32","Issue":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Impact of antipsychotic review and non-pharmacological intervention on health-related quality of life in people with dementia living in care homes: WHELD-a factorial cluster randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1094-1103"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.4572","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Very few interventional studies have directly examined the impact of treatment approaches on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people with dementia.

For CSP versus 'no CSP', adjusted difference in means was 0.52 points on the SF-12 (95% CI -1.28 to 2.32) and -0.08 points on the QoL-AD (95% CI -1.70 to 1.56).

However, carers reported better relationships with the people with dementia (difference 1.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.21, p=0.05).

dementia and their family carers (Community Occupational Therapy in Dementia (COTiD)) was found clinically and cost effective in the Netherlands but not in Germany. This highlights the need to adapt and implement complex interventions to specific national contexts. The current trial aims to evaluate the United Kingdom-adapted occupational therapy intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia and their family carers living in the community (COTiD-UK) compared with treatment as usual.","This study is a multi-centre, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised trial with internal pilot. We aim to allocate 480 pairs, with each pair comprising a person with mild to moderate dementia and a family carer, who provides at least 4 hours of practical support per week, at random between COTiD-UK and treatment as usual. We shall assess participants at baseline, 12 and 26 weeks, and by telephone at 52 and 78 weeks (first 40% of recruits only) after randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) at 26 weeks. Secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, mood, and resource use. To assess intervention delivery, and client experience, we shall collect qualitative data via audio recordings of COTiD-UK sessions and conduct semi-structured interviews with pairs and occupational therapists.","COTiD-UK is an evidence-based person-centred intervention that reflects the current priority to enable people with dementia to remain in their own homes by improving their capabilities whilst reducing carer burden. If COTiD-UK is clinically and cost effective, this has major implications for the future delivery of dementia services across the UK.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN10748953 Date of registration:

and exercise, in conjunction with person-centered care, on antipsychotic use, agitation, and depression in people with dementia living in nursing homes.","A cluster-randomized factorial controlled trial with two replications was conducted in people with dementia in 16 U.K. nursing homes. All homes received training in person-centered care. Eight homes were randomly assigned to antipsychotic review, to a social interaction intervention, and to an exercise intervention for 9 months, with most homes assigned to more than one intervention. The primary outcome measures were antipsychotic use, agitation, and depression. Secondary outcome measures were overall neuropsychiatric symptoms and mortality.","Antipsychotic review significantly reduced antipsychotic use by 50% (odds ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.60). Antipsychotic review plus the social interaction intervention significantly reduced mortality (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.51) compared with the group receiving neither. The group receiving antipsychotic review but not the social intervention showed significantly worse outcome in neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with the group receiving neither (score difference +7.37, 95% CI 1.53 to 13.22). This detrimental impact was mitigated by concurrent delivery of the social intervention (-0.44, CI -4.39 to 3.52). The exercise intervention significantly improved neuropsychiatric symptoms (-3.59, 95% CI -7.08 to -0.09) but not depression (-1.21, CI -4.35 to 1.93). None of the interventions had a significant impact specifically on agitation.","While reductions in antipsychotic use can be achieved by using a \"real world\" intervention, this may not be of benefit to people with dementia in the current climate of more judicious prescribing unless nonpharmacological interventions such as social interaction or exercise are provided in parallel."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"From the Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London;

People with dementia and family carers spoke about the impact of their diagnosis on them and their family and what strategies helped.

dementia. In recent years reminiscence groups have extended to include family members, but carers' experience of attending joint sessions is undocumented. This qualitative study explored the experience of 18 family carers attending 'Remembering Yesterday Caring Today' groups. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: experiencing carer support; shared experience; expectations (met and unmet), carer perspectives of the person with dementia's experience; and learning and comparing. Family carers' experiences varied, with some experiencing the intervention as entirely positive whereas others had more mixed feelings. Negative aspects included the lack of respite from their relative, the lack of emphasis on their own needs, and experiencing additional stress and guilt through not being able to implement newly acquired skills. These findings may explain the failure of a recent trial of joint reminiscence groups to replicate previous findings of positive benefit. More targeted research within subgroups of carers is required to justify the continued use of joint reminiscence groups in dementia care.

A total of 210 residents with dementia in 16 care homes were recruited. Intervention homes received the programme, and control homes were provided usual care.

However, as dementia affects the ability to engage in activity, care-givers can find it difficult to provide appropriate activities. The Pool Activity Level (PAL) Checklist guides the selection of appropriate, personally meaningful activities. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the PAL Checklist when used with older people with dementia. A postal questionnaire sent to activity providers assessed content validity. Validity and reliability were measured in a sample of 60 older people with dementia. The questionnaire response rate was 83% (102\/122). Most respondents felt no important items were missing. Seven of the nine activities were ranked as 'very important' or 'essential' by at least 77% of the sample, indicating very good content validity. Correlation with measures of cognition, severity of dementia and activity performance demonstrated strong concurrent validity. Inter-item correlation indicated strong construct validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient measured internal consistency as excellent (0.95). All items achieved acceptable test-retest reliability, and the majority demonstrated acceptable inter-rater reliability. We conclude that the PAL Checklist demonstrates adequate validity and reliability when used with older people with dementia and appears a useful tool for a variety of care settings."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wenborn","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Mental Health Sciences, University College London, UK. j.wenborn@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Challis","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pool","ForeName":"Jackie","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burgess","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elliott","ForeName":"Nicola","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Validation Study"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","epidemiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Motor Activity"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Swimming Pools","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"4","Day":"5","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"6","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"4","Day":"5","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18389400","791904715","10.1080\/13607860801984375"]}}}]}
