physical and emotional well-being. Hospital staff are expected to understand and respond to the emotions of the patient; however, it is not known how this can be achieved. We provide a concise description of achievable emotion-focused care for patients with dementia.","Exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted with a whole U.K. hospital ward providing dementia care, constituting 47 staff members. Staff responded to four questions using ethnographic freelisting. They listed (a) all the ways they notice the emotional distress of patients with dementia, (b) the causes of emotional distress, (c) all the ways they respond, and (d) the responses that seem to work. Cultural consensus analysis was applied.","A single-factor solution for each question indicated a consensus approach to emotional distress. Emotional distress was noticed from agitation (Smith's saliency score, 0.418), crying (0.350), and increased mobilizing (0.238). The main causes of distress were the unfamiliar hospital environment (0.355) and not knowing what is happening (0.313). The most effective ways to respond to emotional distress required knowing the person (0.299), talking (0.283), and being with the person (0.269).","The findings expand what is understood of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia; these communicated emotional distress with well-understood causes. Prioritized ways of responding to emotional distress described person-centered care. The results offer a menu of options for providing emotionally responsive care for patients with dementia in hospital. Future research should evaluate the care described."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

that draws on medical ethnography, human geography and Geospatial Information Science (GIS) to address the issues surrounding the design and delivery of dementia-friendly services in rural communities. The research question seeks to understand the barriers and drivers to the development of relevant, robust, reliable and accessible services that make a difference among older rural families affected by dementia.","This mixed methods study recruits both families affected by dementia who reside within the Peak District National Park, Derbyshire, and their service providers. The study explores the expectations and experiences of rural dementia by adopting a three-part approach  : longitudinal ethnographic enquiry with up to 32 families affected by dementia (aged 70 years plus) who identify themselves as rural residents  ; ethnographic semistructured interviews and systematic observations of a range of statutory, third sector, private and local community initiatives that seek to support older people living with dementia  ; and geospatial visual mapping of the qualitative and quantitative data. The ethnographic data will be used to explore the ideas of belonging in a community, perceptions of place and identity to determine the factors that influence everyday decisions about living well with dementia and, for the providers, working in a rural community. The geospatial component of the study seeks to incorporate quantitative and qualitative data, such as types, locations and allocation of services to produce an interactive web-based map for local communities to determine the future design and delivery of services when considering dementia-friendly services.","The study is approved by the Leeds and Humberside Health Research Authority 16\/YH\/0163. The study is also approved by other participating organisations as required by their own governance procedures. The study includes people with dementia and as such adheres to the ethical considerations when including people with dementia. A publicly available interactive visual map of the findings will be produced in relation to current services related to location and, by default, identify gaps in provision. Formal reports and dissemination activities will be undertaken in collaboration with the study advisory group members.","The recruitment began in September 2016. The data analysis commenced June 2017, using 59 provider interviews and 27 family participants. Data collection will be completed June 2018.","Please note that the term 'families affected by dementia' is the preferred term of usage by the family members of the Scaling the Peaks Study Advisory Group. The group wish to emphasise that they consider this term to be more representative of their lives than the term living with dementia.","NIHR IRAS 188103; Pre-results."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.
