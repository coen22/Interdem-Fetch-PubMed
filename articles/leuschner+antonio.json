The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability and validity of a Portuguese version of CANE.","A cross-sectional multicenter study was designed using a convenience sample of elderly mental health services' users. CANE was compared with EASYCare, GHQ12, MMSE, Barthel Index and GDS15 to assess criterion and construct validity. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability were also assessed.","79 patients (76% female), with mean age of 74 (+\/- 6.6) years were included. Most patients lived at home with a family caregiver, generally female. Only 32% had no carer. Dementia was the commonest psychiatric diagnosis (61%) and somatic comorbidity was very prevalent (85%). Kappa values (kappa) for inter-rater item reliability ranged from 0.72 to 1.00 (mean values: 0.96 patient, 0.93 carer, 0.90 staff). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for total scores ranged from 0.95 to 0.98.For test-retest item reliability, the mean kappa value was: 0.80 patient, 0.77 carer, 0.81 staff. ICC for total scores ranged from 0.82 to 0.92. Given the absence of a gold standard, criterion validity was assessed by comparing CANE with EASYCare (rs 0.460; p < or = 0.01), GDS (rs 0.615; p < or = 0.01), GHQ (rs 0.581; p < or = 0.01) and Barthel Index (rs-0.435; p < or = 0.01). Overall, inter-item and item-total correlations for CANE and item comparison with other measures indicated reasonable construct validity.","The psychometric proprieties of CANE seem to be consistently good, in accordance with other studies. Robust results on ecological, face, content, criterion and construct validity, as well as good reliability, were achieved. This version is a promising tool for research and practical use in Portuguese old age settings."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fernandes","ForeName":"Lia","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Psychiatry Service of Hospital S.

Stigma in ageing and dementia, accompanied by a sense that there is little to offer until later on in the disease, underpinned the widespread reluctance of GPs to recognise dementia at an early stage and were major obstacles to the timely diagnosis of dementia across all eight countries. Dementia care services varied widely across Europe. Countries with the greatest development of dementia health care services were characterised by national guidelines, GPs fulfilling a gatekeeper function, multi-disciplinary memory clinics and innovative programmes that stimulated practice and new services. Dementia-related stigma was perceived as being less prominent in these countries.","Overcome of delays in the timely diagnosis of dementia needs more than specialist services. They should address the processes associated with stigma, age and dementia, especially where these relate to physician practice and diagnostic disclosure. Stigma is perceived as variable across European States, with a promising finding that its impact is relatively small in countries with the widest range of dementia care services."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra J F J","Initials":"MJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Centre\/Centre for Quality of Care Research\/Vocational training General Practitioners of University Medical Centre Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.vernooy-dassen@voha.umcn.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moniz-Cook","ForeName":"Esme D","Initials":"ED"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"De Lepeleire","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leuschner","ForeName":"Antonio","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Rotrou","ForeName":"Joycelyn","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kenny","ForeName":"Geraldine","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Franco","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Peters","ForeName":"Vincent","Initials":"V"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Medical, Continuing"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Care Services","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health Services","QualifierName":["standards","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Referral and Consultation","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities"},{"DescriptorName":"Respite Care","QualifierName":["statistics & numerical data","supply & distribution"]},{"DescriptorName":"Stereotyping"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"3","Day":"31","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"8","Day":"12","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"3","Day":"31","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15799080","10.1002\/gps.1302"]}}}]}
