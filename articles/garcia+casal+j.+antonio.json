The study evaluated its usability, reliability and validity for the screening of people with Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).","The test was administered to 212 participants (76.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.20 years) classified into three groups (healthy controls, n = 69; AD, n = 84; and aMCI, n = 59) on the basis of detailed neurological, neuropsychological, laboratory and neuro-imaging evidence. Data on usability were collected by means of a questionnaire and automated evaluation.","The validated test comprised 53 stimuli and 7 practice items (one per emotion). Participants reported that Affect-GRADIOR was accessible and user-friendly. It had high internal consistency (ordinal Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.96). Test-retest reliability correlations were significant and robust (r = 0.840, p <\u00a00.001). Exploratory factor analysis supported a seven-factor model of the emotions assessed (neutral expression, happiness, surprise, disgust, sadness, anger and fear). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses suggested that the test discriminated healthy older adults from AD and aMCI cases. Correct answer score improved MMSE predictive power from 0.547 to 0.560 (Cox & Snell R, p = 0.012), and Affect-GRADIOR speed of processing score improved MMSE predictive power from 0.547 to 0.563 (Cox

Emotion recognition is impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus rehabilitation of these skills has the potential to elicit significant benefits.","This study sought to establish whether emotion recognition capacity could be rehabilitated in people with AD.","Thirty-six participants with AD were assigned to one of three conditions: an experimental group (EG) that received 20 sessions of rehabilitation of emotion recognition and 20 sessions of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST), a control group (CG) that received 40 sessions of CST, and a treatment as usual group (TAU).","A positive treatment effect favoring the EG was found; participants were better able to correctly identify emotions (p\u200a=\u200a0.021), made fewer errors of commission (p\u200a=\u200a0.002), had greater precision of processing (p\u200a=\u200a0.021), and faster processing speed (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Specifically, the EG were better able to identify sadness (p\u200a=\u200a0.016), disgust (p\u200a=\u200a0.005), and the neutral expression (p\u200a=\u200a0.014), with quicker processing speed for disgust (p\u200a=\u200a0.002). These gains were maintained at one month follow-up with the exception of processing speed for surprise, which improved.","Capacity to recognize facial expressions of emotions can be improved through specific rehabilitation in people with AD, and gains are still present at a one month follow up. These findings have implications for the design of rehabilitation techniques for people with AD that may lead to improved quality of life and social interactions for this population."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Garc\u00eda-Casal","ForeName":"J Antonio","Initials":"JA","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Research and Development, Iberian Research Psycho-sciences Institute, INTRAS Foundation, Zamora, Spain."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Go\u00f1i-Imizcoz","ForeName":"Miguel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Burgos University Hospital, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perea-Bartolom\u00e9","ForeName":"M Victoria","Initials":"MV","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soto-P\u00e9rez","ForeName":"Felipe","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Research and Development, Iberian Research Psycho-sciences Institute, INTRAS Foundation, Zamora, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smith","ForeName":"Sarah Jane","Initials":"SJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Calvo-Simal","ForeName":"Sara","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Research, Burgos University Hospital, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Franco-Mart\u00edn","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Zamora Regional Hospital, Spain."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Emotions","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Status Schedule"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Recognition, Psychology","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Single-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Statistics, Nonparametric"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Affect","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","cognition","dementia","emotions","neuropsychology","rehabilitation"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"3","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"8","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"3","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28304290","JAD160940","10.3233\/JAD-160940"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27936876","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02","Day":"09"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"01"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"ICT-based applications to improve social health and social participation in older adults with dementia.

However, there is a need to carry out a systematic literature review that focuses on the validity and efficacy of these new technologies assessing their utility to promote 'social health' and 'active ageing' in people with dementia.","Searches in electronic databases identified 3824 articles of which 6 met the inclusion criteria and were coded according to their methodological approach, sample sizes, type of outcomes and results.","Six papers were identified reporting the use of 10 different interventions with people with dementia. Qualitative studies (four) showed a benefit of the use of technologies to foster social participation in people with dementia. At the same time, barriers to a widespread use of these technologies in this population were identified. A quantitative study and a mixed-method study with quantitative outcomes showed that ICT-based interventions promote more social behaviours than non-technology-based interventions.","In the last years, several technological devices for living independently and fostering social health and social participation in people with dementia have been developed. However, specific outcome measures to assess social health and social participation are needed. Even though the analysed studies provided some evidence-base for the use of technology in this field, there is an urge to develop high quality studies and specific outcome measures."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pinto-Bruno","ForeName":"\u00c1ngel C","Initials":"\u00c1C","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Department of personality, evaluation and psychological treatment , University of Salamanca , Salamanca , Spain."},{"Affiliation":"b Department of Research & Development , INTRAS Foundation , Zamora , Spain."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Garc\u00eda-Casal","ForeName":"J Antonio","Initials":"JA","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Department of personality, evaluation and psychological treatment , University of Salamanca , Salamanca , Spain."},{"Affiliation":"b Department of Research & Development , INTRAS Foundation , Zamora , Spain."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Csipke","ForeName":"Emese","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"d Division of Psychiatry , University College London , London , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jenaro-R\u00edo","ForeName":"Cristina","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of personality, evaluation and psychological treatment , University of Salamanca , Salamanca , Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Franco-Mart\u00edn","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Department of personality, evaluation and psychological treatment , University of Salamanca , Salamanca , Spain."},{"Affiliation":"c Department of Psychiatry , Zamora Hospital , Zamora , Spain."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"12"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Computer Systems"},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Information Science"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Participation"},{"DescriptorName":"Technology","QualifierName":"standards"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","older adults","social health","social participation","technology"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27936876","10.1080\/13607863.2016.1262818"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26806365","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"05"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Computer-based cognitive interventions for people living with dementia: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"454-467"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2015.1132677","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To estimate the efficacy of computer-based cognitive interventions for improving cognition in people with dementia (PWD).","Online literature databases were searched for relevant studies.
