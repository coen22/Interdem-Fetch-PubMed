The intervention consisted of an educational program and a multidisciplinary care program and was implemented in 13 nursing homes from September 2015 to March 2017. Costs' outcomes included the time investment of the elderly care physician and health care psychologists regarding the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, residents' psychotropic drug use, nursing staff absenteeism, and costs of the educational program. Composite cost measure contained the sum of costs of staff absenteeism, costs on psychotropic drugs, and costs of the educational program. Costs of time investment were investigated by comparing means. Costs of psychotropic drug use were analyzed with mixed models at resident level and as part of the composite cost measure on unit level. Staff absenteeism was also analyzed at unit level.","Compared with care as usual, the mean costs of time invested decreased with \u20ac36.79 for the elderly care physician but increased with \u20ac46.05 for the health care psychologist in the intervention condition.

investigate the relationship between different neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and the level of distress experienced by nurses caring for residents with young-onset dementia (YOD) and (2) to compare these findings with those for nurses caring for residents with late-onset dementia (LOD).","This is a retrospective study conducted in Dutch long-term care facilities. Data were used from the Behavior and Evolution of Young-ONset Dementia studies (BEYOND) Parts I and II and the WAAL Behavior in Dementia-II (Waalbed-II) study.","A total of 382 nursing home residents with YOD and 261 nursing home residents with LOD were included.","The Neuropsychiatric Inventory, nursing home version, was used to assess nursing staff distress and the frequency (F) and severity (S) of NPS. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationships between nursing staff distress related to NPS and YOD and LOD care units, the F\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0S score per symptom, gender, dementia subtype, and dementia severity.","Nurses working in YOD care units rated sleep and nighttime behavior disorders, delusions, and agitation\/aggression most often as highly distressing and euphoria most often as not distressing. Multivariate analyses indicated that the frequency and severity of NPS were significantly associated with staff distress in all symptoms, except for apathy. Comparison of the 2 groups of nurses demonstrated that the odds for distress related to sleep and nighttime behavior disorders were higher for nurses in YOD care units than for nurses in LOD units. For both the YOD and LOD nurses, irritability in male residents had higher impact than similar behavior in female residents.","This study provides important insight into distress related to individual NPS and the interaction with residents' characteristics. All NPS result in distress. The frequency and severity of the behavior is an important predictor. Sleep and nighttime behavior disorders are more likely to result in distress in YOD nurses than in LOD nurses. The amount of distress related to NPS emphasizes the urgent need for adequate management of NPS and the support of professional caregivers."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

use (PDU) are common in institutionalized People with Young Onset Dementia (PwYOD) and can produce negative outcomes such as reduced quality of life and high workload. In community-dwelling PwYOD, NPS are found to be associated with unmet care needs. This emphasizes the importance of a care program for the management of NPS in institutionalized PwYOD that also addresses unmet care needs and PDU. The objectives of the Behavior and Evolution of Young ONset Dementia part 2 (BEYOND-II) study are to develop a care program for the management of NPS in institutionalized PwYOD and to evaluate its effectiveness.","The care program consists of an educational program combined with an intervention to manage NPS with the following five steps: the evaluation of psychotropic drug prescription, detection, analysis (including the detection of unmet needs), treatment and the evaluation of NPS. A stepped wedge design will be used to evaluate its effectiveness. The primary outcomes are agitation and aggression and other NPS. The secondary outcomes are PDU, quality of life, the workload of nursing staff and job satisfaction. Additionally, a process analysis and a cost-consequence analysis will be conducted.","The study protocol of the Beyond-II study describes the development, implementation and evaluation of a care program for the management of NPS in institutionalized PwYOD. This care program provides a structured method for the management of NPS, in which unmet needs and PDU are also addressed."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Duinen-van den IJssel","ForeName":"J C

dementia, frontotemporal dementia, other) regarding these determinants, and (3) compare QoL profiles of YOD nursing home residents across dementia subtypes.","This cross-sectional study included 207 nursing home residents. Multilevel modeling was used to determine the relationships between QoL and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), dementia severity, psychotropic drug use (PDU), dementia subtype, age, and gender. Additional multilevel models were used to compare aspects of QoL between dementia subtypes.","Residents' QoL was negatively associated with advanced dementia, PDU, and NPS. In general, the relationships between the determinants and QoL were similar across the dementia subtypes. Aspects of QoL differed by dementia subtype. Residents with frontotemporal dementia showed less negative emotions, accepted more help and experienced better quality of relationships with professional caregivers, had a more positive self-image, felt more comfortable in the nursing home environment, and experienced lower quality of social relationships.","Considering the high rates of NPS and PDU in YOD residents and their negative associations with QoL, we recommend emphasizing services to manage and reduce NPS and PDU in nursing home residents with YOD. Furthermore, our findings suggest accounting for differences in aspects of QoL by dementia subtype to address specific needs and thereby improve QoL."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 The Author(s) Published by S.

Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center of Excellence Longitudinal Study at Johns Hopkins is a prospective study that was initiated in 1998.

available services of individuals with young-onset dementia (YOD) and their caregivers were investigated. This knowledge is an important prerequisite for the development of appropriate interventions and personalized care to address their specific needs and problems.","A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Psycinfo and Cinahl. A quality checklist for observational and qualitative studies was used to appraise the methodological quality of the studies.","Twenty-seven studies were included, and a synthesis of the literature revealed six themes. The first theme concerned problems in the diagnostic period. Early recognition and referral was reported as an essential area that required improvement in order to obtain appropriate help in time. The second theme discussed the need for information about YOD and the availability of care throughout the caregiving trajectory. The third theme described barriers in access to care that hindered caregivers in finding the right services. The fourth theme showed the availability of appropriate services and specific unmet needs. The fifth theme illustrated that behavioural and personality changes pose a significant challenge for caregivers and other family members.

years, is relatively rare compared to dementia of later onset, but it is associated with diagnostic difficulty and heavy burden on affected individuals and their informal carers. Existing health and social care structures rarely meet the needs of YOD patients. Internet-based interventions are a novel format of delivering health-related education, counseling, and support to this vulnerable yet underserved group.","The RHAPSODY (Research to Assess Policies and Strategies for Dementia in the Young) project is a European initiative to improve care for people with YOD by providing an internet-based information and skill-building program for family carers. The e-learning program focuses on managing problem behaviors, dealing with role change, obtaining support, and looking after oneself. It will be evaluated in a pilot study in three countries using a randomized unblinded design with a wait-list control group. Participants will be informal carers of people with dementia in Alzheimer's disease or behavioral-variant Frontotemporal degeneration with an onset before the age of 65 years. The primary outcome will be caregiving self-efficacy after 6 weeks of program use. As secondary outcomes, caregivers' stress and burden, carer health-related quality of life, caring-related knowledge, patient problem behaviors, and user satisfaction will be assessed. Program utilization will be monitored and a health-economic evaluation will also be performed.","The RHAPSODY project will add to the evidence on the potential and limitations of a conveniently accessible, user-friendly, and comprehensive internet-based intervention as an alternative for traditional forms of counseling and support in healthcare, aiming to optimize care and support for people with YOD and their informal

cure for Alzheimer disease (AD), the identification of comorbidity is important to reduce the possibility of excess disability. Although comorbidity in patients with late-onset AD (LO-AD) is common, for people with young-onset AD (YO-AD), it is unclear how often comorbidity occurs. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether comorbidity in patients with YO-AD differs from that in patients with LO-AD. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence, types of morbidity, and morbidity profiles in patients with YO-AD compared with those of patients with LO-AD.","Explorative cohort study from 2 separate Dutch cohorts (Needs in Young-onset Dementia [NeedYD] and the Clinical Course of Cognition and Comorbidity-Dementia Study [4C-Dementia study]).","Participants were recruited in 2007 and 2008 from (1) the memory clinics of 3 Dutch Alzheimer centers, (2) the memory clinics of general hospitals, (3) mental health services in the southern part of the Netherlands, and (4) young-onset dementia specialized day care facilities. A comparison group of community-dwelling, elderly patients with AD was selected from the 4C-Dementia study. Patients in this study were recruited in 2010 and 2011 from the aforementioned Alzheimer centers.","The prevalence rates of comorbidity were compared between 177 patients with YO-AD and 155 patients with LO-AD. Comorbidity was classified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The total amount of comorbidity was established by counting the number of existing diseases (ICD categories or chapters) and comorbidity was also dichotomized as present or absent. Furthermore, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to study clusters of comorbidity.","Compared with LO-AD, patients with YO-AD showed less (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) overall comorbidity (58.2% vs 86.5%) and had lower prevalence rates of diabetes, obesity, and circulatory diseases; however, the prevalence rates of diseases of the nervous system in YO-AD (6.2%) were higher compared with those of patients with LO-AD (4.5%). The cluster analysis revealed a distinctive group of patients with YO-AD with either no comorbidity or with a disease of the nervous system. Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and diseases of the circulatory system were present in 34% of the patients with YO-AD.","Comorbidity is less common in YO-AD than in LO-AD. However, general practitioners should be aware that approximately one-third of the patients with YO-AD suffer from or have endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and\/or diseases of the circulatory system. Treatment should therefore not only focus on dementia but also on comorbidity. This attention may slow the functional decline in AD. These exploratory analyses suggested a higher prevalence of nervous system diseases in YO-AD compared with LO-AD. However, the finding did not reach statistical significance and in combination with the exploratory nature of the analyses justifies further investigation. If verified, this finding may help to decrease the time to diagnosis of AD and, subsequently, support in young patients with a neurological disease. Further investigation is needed to gain more insight into the association between comorbidity and AD in younger people."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

The children had difficulties managing all of the responsibilities and showed concerns about their future. To deal with these problems, they demonstrated various coping styles, such as avoidant or adaptive coping. Although most children were initially reluctant to seek professional care, several of them expressed the need for practical guidance to address the changing behavior of their parent.
