Hospital environments can be particularly confusing and challenging for people living with dementia (Plwd) impacting their wellbeing and the ability to optimize their care. Improving the experience of care in hospital has been recognized as a priority, and non-pharmacological interventions including activity interventions have been associated with improved wellbeing and behavioral outcomes for Plwd in other settings. This systematic review aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of activity interventions to improve experience of care for Plwd in hospital.","Systematic searches were conducted in 16 electronic databases up to October 2019. Reference lists of included studies and forward citation searching were also conducted. Quantitative studies reporting comparative data for activity interventions delivered to Plwd aiming to improve their experience of care in hospital were included. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved by discussion with a third where necessary. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated where possible to support narrative statements and aid interpretation.","Six studies met the inclusion criteria (one randomized and five non-randomized uncontrolled studies) including 216 Plwd. Activity interventions evaluated music, art, social, psychotherapeutic, and combinations of tailored activities in relation to wellbeing outcomes. Although studies were generally underpowered, findings indicated beneficial effects of activity interventions with improved mood and engagement of Plwd while in hospital, and reduced levels of responsive behaviors. Calculated SMDs ranged from very small to large but were mostly statistically non-significant.","The small number of identified studies indicate that activity-based interventions implemented in hospitals may be effective in improving aspects of the care experience for Plwd. Larger well-conducted studies are needed to fully evaluate the potential of this type of non-pharmacological intervention to improve experience of care in hospital settings, and whether any benefits extend to staff wellbeing and the wider ward environment."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lourida","ForeName":"Ilianna","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"NIHR Applied Research Collaboration (ARC), Evidence Synthesis Team, PenARC, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus, University of Exeter, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"CD011961"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/14651858.CD011961.pub2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Approximately 60% to 80% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience cognitive impairment that impacts on their quality of life. Cognitive decline is a core feature of the disease and can often present before the onset of motor symptoms. Cognitive training may be a useful non-pharmacological intervention that could help to maintain or improve cognition and quality of life for people with PD dementia (PDD) or PD-related mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI).","To determine whether cognitive training (targeting single or multiple domains) improves cognition in people with PDD and PD-MCI or other clearly defined forms of cognitive impairment in people with PD.","We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Trials Register (8 August 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We searched reference lists and trial registers, searched relevant reviews in the area and conference proceedings. We also contacted experts for clarifications on data and ongoing trials.","We included randomised controlled trials where the participants had PDD or PD-MCI, and where the intervention was intended to train general or specific areas of cognitive function, targeting either a single domain or multiple domains of cognition, and was compared to a control condition. Multicomponent interventions that also included motor or other elements were considered eligible.","Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for inclusion in the review. Two review authors also independently undertook extraction of data and assessment of methodological quality. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence.","Seven studies with a total of 225 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. All seven studies compared the effects of a cognitive training intervention to a control intervention at the end of treatment periods lasting four to eight weeks. Six studies included people with PD living in the community. These six studies recruited people with single-domain (executive) or multiple-domain mild cognitive impairment in PD. Four of these studies identified participants with MCI using established diagnostic criteria, and two included both people with PD-MCI and people with PD who were not cognitively impaired. One study recruited people with a diagnosis of PD dementia who were living in long-term care settings. The cognitive training intervention in three studies targeted a single cognitive domain, whilst in four studies multiple domains of cognitive function were targeted. The comparison groups either received no intervention or took part in recreational activities (sports, music, arts), speech or language exercises, computerised motor therapy, or motor rehabilitation combined with recreational activity. We found no clear evidence that cognitive training improved global cognition. Although cognitive training was associated with higher scores on global cognition at the end of treatment, the result was imprecise and not statistically significant (6 trials, 178 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.59; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference at the end of treatment between cognitive training and control interventions on executive function (5 trials, 112 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.48; low-certainty evidence) or visual processing (3 trials, 64 participants; SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.81; low-certainty evidence). The evidence favoured the cognitive training group on attention (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.68; low-certainty evidence) and verbal memory (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.69; low-certainty evidence), but these effects were less certain in sensitivity analyses that excluded a study in which only a minority of the sample were cognitively impaired. There was no evidence of differences between treatment and control groups in activities of daily living (3 trials, 67 participants; SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.53; low-certainty evidence) or quality of life (5 trials, 147 participants; SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence). There was very little information on adverse events. We considered the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to be low due to risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the results. We identified six ongoing trials recruiting participants with PD-MCI, but no ongoing trials of cognitive training for people with PDD.","This review found no evidence that people with PD-MCI or PDD who receive cognitive training for four to eight weeks experience any important cognitive improvements at the end of training. However, this conclusion was based on a small number of studies with few participants, limitations of study design and execution, and imprecise results. There is a need for more robust, adequately powered studies of cognitive training before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of cognitive training for people with PDD and PD-MCI. Studies should use formal criteria to diagnose cognitive impairments, and there is a particular need for more studies testing the efficacy of cognitive training in people with PDD."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

situation, both generally concerning the diagnosis and more specifically around certain aspects or objects of awareness such as awareness of memory impairment, altered daily activities or social functioning. The extent of awareness or\u00a0lack of awareness has consequences for well-being of PwD and carers, impacting on rates of hospital admission, institutionalization, mood, adjustment to diagnosis, outcomes from intervention and carer burden. An accurate estimation of a person's awareness could therefore be useful in a clinical setting to support PwD and their carers in making appropriate choices for health and care decisions, and could facilitate safe management by health care professionals, e.g. in an acute care setting. There is a range of different approaches to measuring awareness reported in the dementia research literature, with varying estimates of the frequency of lack of awareness, reflecting different methodologies and populations. The majority of the methods have been developed for research purposes and may not be suitable for clinical use. There are no recent scoping or systematic reviews of the available methods.","We will conduct a scoping review of published studies that have assessed awareness in people with dementia of all types, and all degrees of severity. The systematic search will include the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, using search terms for dementia (\"dement*\" or \"Alzheimer*\" or \"Pick's disease\") and \"awareness\", \"unawareness\", \"anosognosia\", \"insight\", \"denial\", \"metacognit*\" or \"discrepanc*\" identified from pilot searches. Findings will be mapped and described according to the method used, the setting and diagnosis and the object of awareness studied if specified. Validated measures will be identified.","This scoping review will provide an overview of the methods used to measure awareness in people with dementia, allowing comparison of the methods along with identification of validated measures. The methods or components will be appraised for potential clinical use, and gaps in research will be highlighted."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alexander","ForeName":"Catherine M","Initials":"CM","Identifier":"0000-0002-0052-9938","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"REACH: The Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health, College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

measures of mood, stress, resilience, general health, quality of life, care burden, and relationship satisfaction, as well as sociodemographic factors. Additionally, data on motor and neuropsychiatric symptom severity of people with PD-MCI, PDD, or DLB were obtained in a subsample.","Most spouses were married women (>85%) who provided a median of 4 years of care and 84 hours of weekly care. Among these, relationship dissatisfaction, stress, anxiety, care burden, and feelings of resentment were common. Spouses of people with PDD and DLB had significantly higher rates of burden, resentment, and depression compared to spouses of people with PD-MCI. Furthermore, unique group differences emerged whereby spouses of people with PDD had significantly longer duration of care provision, higher stress, more relationship dissatisfaction, and fewer positive interactions, compared to PD-MCI group, whereas anxiety and lower levels of mental health were prominent in spouses of people with DLB, compared to PD-MCI group. Despite this, the majority of spouses reported good quality of life, resilience, and satisfaction with the caring role.","Both PDD and DLB significantly contribute to poorer mental health and higher levels of care burden in spouses.

investigate how different levels of functional ability relate to quality of life, well-being, and satisfaction with life, conceptualised as reflecting capability to \"live well\" in people with dementia.","Participants were 1496 people with mild-to-moderate dementia and 1188 informants who completed baseline assessments in the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) cohort study. Total self-rated and informant-rated scores on the Functional Activities Questionnaire were split into six ability levels to monitor how poorer functioning impacts the ability to live well. We also investigated the potential influence of sociodemographic and diagnostic variables, depression, cognition, and carer stress.","Multivariate multiple regression models found that people with dementia who had the greatest functional impairment according to self-ratings and informant ratings had poorer living well scores than those with the least functional impairment. Sociodemographic and diagnostic factors and cognition had little impact on effect sizes. For self-ratings, depression attenuated the relationship between functional ability and living well, whereas carer stress attenuated informant ratings.","People with dementia with the least functional impairments had greater capability to live well than those with the most functional impairment. Even subtle perceived difficulties in functional ability had a detrimental effect on the ability of people with dementia to live well. Depression in people with dementia and carer stress in informants influenced these associations, and therefore, these factors should be routinely included in future research studies and clinical assessments."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Cognitive training (CT) is an approach that uses guided practice on structured tasks with the direct aim of improving or maintaining cognitive abilities.","\u2022 To assess effects of CT on cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers.\u2022 To compare effects of CT with those of other non-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive stimulation or rehabilitation, for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers.\u2022 To identify and explore factors related to intervention and trial design that may be associated with the efficacy of CT for people with mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers.","We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, on 5 July 2018. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified through monthly searches of several major healthcare databases and numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. In addition to this, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's trials portal, ICTRP, to ensure that searches were comprehensive and up-to-date.","We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that described interventions for people with mild to moderate dementia and compared CT versus a control or alternative intervention.","We extracted relevant data from published manuscripts and through contact with trial authors if required. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We divided comparison conditions into active or passive control conditions and alternative treatments. We used a large number of measures and data to evaluate 19 outcomes at end of treatment, as well as 16 outcomes at follow-up in the medium term; we pooled this information in meta-analyses. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment effect using a random-effects model, and we estimated statistical heterogeneity using a standard Chi\u00b2 statistic. We graded the evidence using GradePro.","The 33 included trials were published between 1988 and 2018 and were conducted in 12 countries; most were unregistered, parallel-group, single-site RCTs, with samples ranging from 12 to 653 participants. Interventions were between two and 104 weeks long. We classified most experimental interventions as 'straight CT', but we classified some as 'augmented CT', and about two-thirds as multi-domain interventions. Researchers investigated 18 passive and 13 active control conditions, along with 15 alternative treatment conditions, including occupational therapy, mindfulness, reminiscence therapy, and others.The methodological quality of studies varied, but we rated nearly all studies as having high or unclear risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment, and high or unclear risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel.We used data from 32 studies in the meta-analysis of at least one outcome. Relative to a control condition, we found moderate-quality evidence showing a small to moderate effect of CT on our first primary outcome, composite measure of global cognition at end of treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.62), and high-quality evidence showing a moderate effect on the secondary outcome of verbal semantic fluency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.81) at end of treatment, with these gains retained in the medium term (3 to 12 months post treatment). In relation to many other outcomes, including our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term, the quality of evidence was very low, so we were unable to determine whether CT was associated with any meaningful gains.When compared with an alternative treatment, we found that CT may have little to no effect on our first primary outcome of global cognition at end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.64), but the quality of evidence was low. No evidence was available to assess our second primary outcome of clinical disease severity in the medium term. We found moderate-quality evidence showing that CT was associated with improved mood of the caregiver at end of treatment, but this was based on a single trial. The quality of evidence in relation to many other outcomes at end of treatment and in the medium term was too low for us to determine whether CT was associated with any gains, but we are moderately confident that CT did not lead to any gains in mood, behavioural and psychological symptoms, or capacity to perform activities of daily living.","Relative to a control intervention, but not to a variety of alternative treatments, CT is probably associated with small to moderate positive effects on global cognition and verbal semantic fluency at end of treatment, and these benefits appear to be maintained in the medium term. Our certainty in relation to many of these findings is low or very low. Future studies should take stronger measures to mitigate well-established risks of bias, and should provide long-term follow-up to improve our understanding of the extent to which observed gains are retained. Future trials should also focus on direct comparison of CT versus alternative treatments rather than passive or active control conditions."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bahar-Fuchs","ForeName":"Alex","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Academic

people with mild to moderate dementia that addresses the impact of cognitive impairment on everyday functioning.","To determine whether or not CR is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or vascular or mixed dementia, and their carers.","This multicentre randomised controlled trial compared CR with treatment as usual (TAU). Following a baseline assessment and goal-setting to identify areas of everyday functioning that could be improved or better managed, participants were randomised (1\u2009:\u20091) via secure web access to an independent randomisation centre to receive either TAU or CR and followed up at 3 and 9 months post randomisation.","Community.","Participants had an , Tenth Edition, diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or vascular or mixed dementia, had mild to moderate cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination score of \u2265\u200918 points), were stable on medication if prescribed, and had a family carer who was willing to contribute. The exclusion criteria were people with a history of brain injury or other neurological disorder and an inability to speak English. To achieve adequate power, we needed 350 people to complete the trial, with 175 people in each trial arm.","Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of 10 therapy sessions over 3 months, followed by four maintenance sessions over 6 months, delivered in participants' homes. The therapists were nine occupational therapists and one nurse.","The primary outcome was self-reported goal attainment at 3 months. Goal attainment was also assessed at 9 months. Carers provided independent ratings of goal attainment at both time points. The secondary outcomes were participant quality of life, mood, self-efficacy and cognition, and carer stress, health status and quality of life. The assessments at 3 and 9 months were conducted by researchers who were blind to the participants' group allocation.","A total of 475 participants were randomised (CR arm, \u2009=\u2009239; TAU arm, \u2009=\u2009236), 427 participants (90%) completed the trial and 426 participants were analysed (CR arm, \u2009=\u2009208, TAU arm, \u2009=\u2009218). At 3 months, there were statistically significant large positive effects for participant-rated goal attainment [mean change in the CR arm: 2.57; mean change in the TAU arm: 0.86; Cohen's\u2009=\u20090.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.19], corroborated by carer ratings (Cohen's\u2009=\u20091.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.34). These effects were maintained at 9 months for both the participant ratings (Cohen's \u2009=\u20090.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17) and the carer ratings (Cohen's \u2009=\u20090.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.20). There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes. In the cost-utility analyses, there was no evidence of cost-effectiveness in terms of gains in the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of the person with dementia (measured using the DEMentia Quality Of Life questionnaire utility score) or the QALYs of the carer (measured using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version) from either cost perspective. In the cost-effectiveness analyses, by reference to the primary outcome of participant-rated goal attainment, CR was cost-effective from both the health and social care perspective and the societal perspective at willingness-to-pay values of \u00a32500 and above for improvement in the goal attainment measure. There was no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the self-efficacy measure (the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale) from either cost perspective.","Possible limitations arose from the non-feasibility of using observational outcome measures, the lack of a general measure of functional ability and the exclusion of people without a carer or with rarer forms of dementia.","Cognitive rehabilitation is clinically effective in enabling people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy sessions.","Next steps will focus on the implementation of CR into NHS and social care services and on extending the approach to people with rarer forms of dementia.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN21027481.","This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in ; Vol. 23, No. 10.

This individualised therapy is conducted in people\u2019s own homes over several sessions. A therapist works with the person and the carer to identify realistic and relevant goals, plan how to tackle these and support people in achieving them. Previous small studies suggested that CR could be beneficial.","The Goal-oriented cognitive Rehabilitation in Early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias: multicentre single-blind randomised controlled Trial (GREAT) was run in eight centres to find out whether or not CR improves everyday functioning. Participants were in the early stages of having Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia or mixed dementia, with a family carer involved. At the first assessment, participants identified areas in which they would like to see improvements, and set goals. Participants and carers rated how well participants were currently doing in relation to these goals and completed questionnaires, for example about mood and quality of life. Participants were then randomly selected to either receive CR or continue with treatment as usual (TAU). CR consisted of 10 weekly sessions with the therapist over 3 months, followed by four sessions over the next 6 months. Participants were reassessed after 3 and 9 months.","We included 475 participants, and 427 participants (90%) completed the trial (209 participants in the CR arm and 218 participants in the TAU arm). After 3 months, the ratings by both participants and carers in the CR group showed that participants were doing significantly better in relation to their goals, and this was maintained 6 months later. Ratings for the TAU-arm participants did not improve significantly. There were no other differences between the groups. There was a strong economic case for CR.","Cognitive rehabilitation is effective in enabling people with early-stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy sessions.

is hampered by inconsistent conceptualization and measurement of outcomes and limited evidence about the relative impact of different variables. We aimed to address these issues.","We analyzed data from 1283 caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia in the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life cohort study. We generated a \"living well\" latent factor from measures of quality of life, satisfaction with life, and well-being. We used structural equation modelling to derive latent variables for 7 domains reflecting caregivers' perceptions of their personal resources and experiences, and to examine the associations with caregivers' perceptions of their capability to \"live well.\"","The domain of psychological characteristics and psychological health was most strongly related to living well [2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08-2.97], followed by physical fitness and physical health (1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-1.91) and experiencing caregiving (1.34; 95% CI, 0.99-1.70). Social capitals, assets and resources (0.68; 95% CI, 0.35-1.00) and relationship with the person with dementia (-0.22; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.03) had smaller, significant associations. Social location (0.28; 95% CI, -0.33 to 0.89) and managing everyday life with dementia (0.06; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.28) were not significantly associated with living well.","These findings demonstrate the importance of supporting caregivers' psychological and physical health and their ability to develop and maintain positive coping strategies, as well as enabling them to maintain vital social capitals, assets and resources."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for

Participants allocated to CR received 10 weekly sessions over 3\u00a0months and four maintenance sessions over 6\u00a0months. Participants were followed up 3 and 9\u00a0months post randomisation by blinded researchers. The primary outcome was self-reported goal attainment at 3\u00a0months. Secondary outcomes at 3 and 9\u00a0months included informant-reported goal attainment, quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, and cognition and study partner stress and quality of life.","We randomised (1:1) 475 people with dementia; 445 (CR\u00a0=\u00a0281) were included in the intention to treat analysis at 3\u00a0months and 426 (CR\u00a0=\u00a0208) at 9\u00a0months.

for dementia and the number of people living with the condition predicted to rapidly rise, there is an urgent need for dementia risk reduction and prevention interventions. Modifiable lifestyle risk factors have been identified as playing a major role in the development of dementia; hence, interventions addressing these risk factors represent a significant opportunity to reduce the number of people developing dementia. Relatively few interventions have been trialed in older participants with cognitive decline (secondary prevention).","This study evaluates the efficacy and feasibility of a multidomain lifestyle risk reduction intervention for people with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).","This study is an 8-week, two-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a lifestyle modification program to reduce dementia risk. The active control group receives the following four online educational modules: dementia literacy and lifestyle risk, Mediterranean diet (MeDi), cognitive engagement and physical activity. The intervention group also completes the same educational modules but receives additional practical components including sessions with a dietitian, online brain training and sessions with an exercise physiologist to assist with lifestyle modification.","Primary outcome measures are cognition (The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive-Plus [ADAS-Cog-Plus]) and a composite lifestyle risk factor score for Alzheimer's disease (Australian National University - Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index [ANU-ADRI]). Secondary outcome measures are motivation to change lifestyle (Motivation to Change Lifestyle and Health Behaviour for Dementia Risk Reduction [MCLHB-DRR]) and health-related quality of life (36-item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]). Feasibility will be determined through adherence to diet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener [MEDAS] and Australian Recommended Food Score [ARFS]), cognitive engagement (BrainHQ-derived statistics) and physical activity interventions (physical activity calendars). Outcomes are measured at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up by researchers blind to group allocation.","If successful and feasible, secondary prevention lifestyle interventions could provide a targeted, cost-effective way to reduce the number of people with cognitive decline going on to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McMaster","ForeName":"Mitchell","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

and clinical level is an important precursor to developing preventive strategies focusing on dementia risk reduction in primary healthcare settings.","Using England as a case study, we review policies and strategies relevant to dementia prevention from the national to local level and how these are translated into primary healthcare services.","We conducted a scoping review covering: 1) identification of national, regional, and local policies and strategies that include dementia prevention; 2) identification of national guidelines for implementing dementia prevention at the clinical level; and 3) evaluation of the implementation of these at the clinical level.","Dementia prevention is addressed in national policy, and this filters through to regional and local levels. Focus on dementia prevention is limited and variable. Reference to modifiable risk factors is associated with other non-communicable diseases, placing less emphasis on factors more dementia specific. Evidence of implementation of dementia prevention policies at the clinical level is limited and inconsistent. Available evidence suggests messages about dementia prevention may best be delivered through primary healthcare services such as the National Health Service (NHS) Health Check.","The limitations identified in this review could be addressed through development of a national policy focused specifically on dementia prevention. This could provide a platform for increasing knowledge and understanding among the general population and healthcare professionals. It would be important for such a policy to cover the full range of modifiable risk factors relevant to

a major need for longitudinal research examining the experiences of people with dementia and their primary carers, as relatively little is known about how the factors associated with capability to 'live well' vary over time. The main aim of the IDEAL-2 study is to investigate how and why, over time, people with dementia and their primary carers might vary in their capability to live well with dementia, whilst exploring both their use of health and care services and their unmet needs.","IDEAL-2 will build on the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) cohort of 1547 people (who, at recruitment between July 2014 and July 2016, had mild-to-moderate dementia), and their 1283 primary carers in Great Britain. The existing cohort will be enriched with additional participants with mild-to-moderate dementia (and their primary carers where available and willing) from the following groups: people with rarer forms of dementia, and\/or those who are \u226590\u00a0years or\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years of age at time of recruitment. We will assess the primary outcome, capability to live well with dementia, and the factors influencing it using questionnaires at yearly intervals for 3 years. Additionally, we will seek to link the cohort data with administrative data to obtain information about health service use. Some participants will be invited for in-depth face-to-face interviews. The cohort study will be supplemented by linked research focusing on: the co-production of new measures of living well; including the perspectives of people with advanced dementia living in residential care settings; including people with dementia from black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups; and understanding the experience of people living with undiagnosed dementia.","IDEAL-2 will provide evidence about the key indicators of, and factors associated with, living well over the course of dementia and how these differ for particular subgroups. It will tell us which combinations of services and support are most beneficial and cost-effective. Moreover, the IDEAL-2 study will gather evidence from under-researched groups of people with dementia, who are likely to have their own distinct perceptions of living well."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Silarova","ForeName":"Barbora","Initials":"B","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2473-2527","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health (REACH), College of Medicine and Health, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

significant stress, strain, and burden for life partners. A common measurement of life partner burden is the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), which considers \"burden\" as a unitary concept; however, burden is highly complex and most likely comprises several dimensions. This study aimed to explore the factor structure of the ZBI in life partners of PwPRD and to examine the relationships among the emerging factors and the demographic and clinical features.","Life partners of PwPRD participated in home-based quantitative assessments and self-completed postal questionnaires. The assessment battery included ZBI, measures of relationship satisfaction, mood, stress, resilience, health, quality of life, feelings related to care provision, and sociodemographic questions. Data on PwPRDs' motor and neuropsychiatric symptom severity were also elicited in home-based assessments.","An exploratory factor analysis (principal axis factoring) of ZBI, conducted with 127 life partners, revealed five burden dimensions: social and psychological constraints, personal strain, interference with personal life, concerns about future, and guilt. These burden factors were associated with lower relationship satisfaction, mental health, and resilience, and higher stress, anxiety, depression, resentment, negative strain, and PwPRD motor severity. In multiple linear regression analyses, where each factor score was the dependent variable, stress, negative strain, and resentment emerged as significant predictors of specific burden dimensions.","Burden is a complex and multidimensional construct.

Variation in subtypes and associated symptoms may influence the capability to live well for people with dementia and carers. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of dementia subtypes on the capability to live well for both people with dementia and their carers.","The analysis was based on the 1283 dyads of community-dwelling people with dementia and carers in the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) project, a large cohort study in Great Britain. Capability to live well was defined using three measures: quality of life, life satisfaction and wellbeing. Structural equation modelling was used to investigate capability to live well in seven dementia subtypes: Alzheimer's disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), mixed AD\/VaD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), Lewy body dementia (LBD) and unspecified\/other, accounting for dyadic data structure and adjusting for age and sex, type of relationship between person with dementia and their carer and the number of chronic conditions.","The major subtypes in this study population were AD (56%), VaD (11%) and mixed AD\/VaD (21%). Compared to participants with AD, people with non-AD subtypes generally reported a lower capability to live well. Carers for people with PDD (-\u20091.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) -\u20093.24, -\u20090.18) and LBD (-\u20092.29; 95% CI -\u20093.84, -\u20090.75) also reported a lower capability to live well than carers for people with AD. After adjusting for demographic factors and comorbidity, PDD (-\u20094.28; 95% CI -\u20095.65, -\u20092.91) and LBD (-\u20093.76; 95% CI -\u20095.14, -\u20092.39) continued to have the strongest impact on both people with dementia and their carers.","This study suggests a variation in capability to live well across dementia subtypes. It is important for care providers to consider different needs across subtypes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been questioned recently. To date, the specific effects of cognitive rehabilitation (CR), cognitive training (CT), and cognitive stimulation [CS] have not been analyzed due to inconsistencies in the use of the comparison groups. This work aims to analyze the differential effects of CFIs by removing the influence of the comparison group from the estimates of the effects.","a literature search performed in Pubmed, Proquest, and Embase databases yielded 65 potential studies, of which 33 studies with a sample size of 1,225 individuals were meta-analyzed. Each intervention group was treated as the unit of analysis to remove the confounding effects of the comparison condition. Measures of general cognitive functioning, memory and functional outcomes were compared using the hierarchical robust variance estimator metaregression. Age, education, sex, risk of bias, sample size, duration of intervention, the proportion of drop-outs, pharmacological treatment, and severity of disease were included as covariates.","Only CT differed from no cognition-focused interventions (NCFI) for memory outcomes in univariate analyses, but differences became nonsignificant when covariates were included in the model. CR showed a significantly higher effect in outcomes measuring functioning in targeted domains with no differences in standard cognitive tests relative to NCFI.","This work supports previous findings questioning the efficacy of CT or CS for AD. Moving toward CFIs focused on relevant goals and including measures related to the skills, abilities or activities that are the focus of the intervention is encouraged.

We examined the available evidence in a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched electronic databases until 7 January 2016 for observational studies investigating factors associated with QoL, well-being and life satisfaction in people with dementia. Articles had to provide quantitative data and include \u2a7e75% people with dementia of any type or severity. We included 198 QoL studies taken from 272 articles in the meta-analysis. The analysis focused on 43 factors with sufficient data, relating to 37639 people with dementia. Generally, these factors were significantly associated with QoL, but effect sizes were often small (0.1-0.29) or negligible (<0.09). Factors reflecting relationships, social engagement and functional ability were associated with better QoL. Factors indicative of poorer physical and mental health (including depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms) and poorer carer well-being were associated with poorer QoL. Longitudinal evidence about predictors of QoL was limited. There was a considerable between-study heterogeneity. The pattern of numerous predominantly small associations with QoL suggests a need to reconsider approaches to understanding and assessing living well with

Although there are generic measures of illness representations, there is a need for a brief tailored measure to use with people with dementia. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a brief measure called the Representations and Adjustment to Dementia Index (RADIX). The RADIX contains questions on the SRM elements: Identity, Cause, Timeline, Control, and Consequences.","The RADIX validation was conducted with a sample of 385 community-dwelling people with mild to moderate dementia who were taking part in the IDEAL cohort study. Test-retest reliability was conducted over a 4-week period with a separate sample of 20 people with dementia.","The validation process resulted in a reduction in the number of items in the Timeline, Control, and Consequences items. The resulting RADIX demonstrated good acceptability, internal reliability, and test-retest reliability. All the RADIX items had low missing data, indicating good acceptability. The factor analysis confirmed that the Consequences items formed two subscales (practical and emotional consequences) that had Cronbach's \u03b1 of 8 and 0.91 respectively. Test-retest reliability indicated that the Identity, Timeline, and Control items had moderate reliability and the practical and emotional consequences scales had good reliability.","The RADIX demonstrates acceptable psychometric properties, proves to be a useful measure for exploring people's beliefs about dementia, and could aid the provision of tailored information and support to people with dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

We utilise this concept to inform our analysis of 18 qualitative interviews with five people with dementia and four informal carers. Our participants are members of a pre-existing group of dementia advocates, representing the voices of those living with the condition. There are a growing number of people in the early stages of dementia - like our participants - being called upon to account for their experience, as a means of developing a politicised 'collective illness identity'. These interviews present an opportunity to study a group of people who are actively involved in speaking as, and for, people with dementia. Four themes emerged from the data: becoming a voice of or for people with dementia; biographical reinforcement; responsibilisation; and resistance. These themes illustrate the ways in which people with dementia participate in their own identity construction and, as representatives of those living with dementia, they also illustrate the ways in which illness narratives produce material and symbolic value.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

It is therefore imperative that research informs ways of maintaining such care. In this study, we propose that a needs-led approach can provide a useful, novel means of conceptualizing the impact of caring on the lives of family carers. Our aim was to develop and present a needs-led framework for understanding how providing care impacts on carers' fulfilment of needs.","In this qualitative study, we conducted 42 semistructured interviews with a purposively diverse sample of family carers to generate nuanced contextualized accounts of how caring impacted on carers' lives. Our inductive thematic analysis focused upon asking: \"What need is being impacted here?\" in order to generate a needs-led framework for understanding.","Nine themes were widely endorsed. Each completed the sentence: \"Being a carer impacts on fulfilling my need to\/for\u2026.\": Freedom; feel close to my relative; feel in control of my life; be my own person; protect my relative; share\/express my thoughts and feelings; take care of myself; feel connected to the people around me; get things done.","These needs echo those from other research areas, with relational needs emerging as particularly central. The needs-led approach offers a perspective that is able to capture both stresses and positive aspects of caregiving. We recommend that clinical interviewing using Socratic questioning to discover human needs that are being impacted by caring would provide a valuable starting point for care planning."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pini","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Patient

The goals focused on preventing future cases of dementia through risk reduction, maximising the benefit of a dementia diagnosis, improving quality of life, enabling the dementia workforce to improve practice, and optimising the quality and inclusivity of health and social care systems. Recommendations addressed gaps in knowledge and limitations in research methodology or infrastructure that would facilitate research in prioritised areas. A 10-point action plan provides strategies for delivering the proposed research agenda.","By creating complementary goals for research that mirror the need to find effective treatments, we provide a framework that enables a focus for new investment and initiatives.

with both MCI and MrNPS, and its effects on meta-cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes, as well as establish whether adapting difficulty levels and tailoring to individuals' profile is superior to generic training.","Older adults with MCI (n\u200a=\u200a9), MrNPS (n\u200a=\u200a11), or both (MCI+, n\u200a=\u200a25) were randomized into a home-based individually-tailored and adaptive CCT (n\u200a=\u200a21) or an active control condition (AC; n\u200a=\u200a23) in a double-blind design. Interventions lasted 8-12 weeks and outcomes were assessed after the intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up.","Participants in both conditions reported greater satisfaction with their everyday memory following intervention and at follow-up. However, participants in the CCT condition showed greater improvement on composite measures of memory, learning, and global cognition at follow-up. Participants with MrNPS in the CCT condition were also found to have improved mood at 3-month follow-up and reported using fewer memory strategies at the post-intervention and follow-up assessments. There was no evidence that participants with MCI+ were disadvantaged relative to the other diagnostic conditions. Finally, informant-rated caregiver burden declined at follow-up assessment in the CCT condition relative to the AC condition.","Home-based CCT with adaptive difficulty and personal tailoring appears superior to more generic CCT in relation to both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes.

For comparison there are 36.7 million HIV cases with an estimated 2 million new cases each year (WHO, 2017). The rise in dementia prevalence is largely due to population ageing, with the oldest being at highest risk. To date there are no diseases modifying medications for Alzheimer's disease or the other causes of dementia. Academics and research groups are increasingly focused on prevention or delay of dementia (Brayne and Miller, 2017) and a number of organizations now prioritize dementia, indicating a strong and coherent international effort to address this problem.

CFAS Wales Phase 1 data were collected from 2010 to 2013 by conducting structured interviews with older people aged over 65\u00a0years of age living in urban and rural areas of Wales, and included questions that assessed cognitive functioning, mood, and social networks.

Participants in the MCI category had weaker social networks than participants without cognitive impairment, whereas stronger social networks were associated with a decrease in the odds of experiencing mood problems, suggesting that they may offer a protective effect against anxiety and depression.

dementia. There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)].

area of study because it forms part of the diagnostic process and may help in monitoring disease progression. Most researchers and clinicians rely on informant ratings rather than observing actual functional performance or employing self-ratings. There has however been little research to verify whether informant ratings of functioning are accurate, and there has been even less research investigating the accuracy of self-ratings of functional ability in PwD. No study has used the performance-monitoring metacognitive approach to investigate awareness of functional ability.","Thirty-seven people with early-stage dementia completed an objective functional assessment and provided self-ratings before and after completing each section of the objective test. Informants provided ratings of functioning and burden. Scores were converted to percentages to allow for direct comparison.","Objectively assessed functional ability significantly correlated with self-ratings and informant ratings. Self-ratings did not correlate with informant ratings. For converted scores, self-ratings were more similar than informant ratings to the objectively assessed mean scores. Burden was unrelated to functional assessments after correcting for multiple comparisons.","Self-rated functional ability was more accurate than informant ratings when compared with objectively assessed ability, with informants tending to significantly underestimate the functional ability of PwD. The findings call into question the likelihood that informants will provide accurate ratings of functional ability and suggests that self-ratings may offer a more accurate estimate of functional ability. Self-ratings made by PwD should be more widely employed in clinical and research settings.

policy makers, the focus of end of life care has been on the dying trajectory of malignant disease. People with severe dementia have complex physical and psychological needs, yet the disease is not always recognised as terminal. Advance Care Planning involving people with dementia and their families can provide opportunities to discuss and later, initiate timely palliative care. We conducted a scoping review of studies exploring decisions associated with the EoLC of people with dementia.

Three exemplar populations are frail older people, people with dementia and people with severe traumatic brain injury. We hypothesise that these groups face some over-lapping challenges in securing good end-of-life care linked to their limited agency. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a scoping review and thematic synthesis.","To capture a range of literature, we followed established scoping review methods. We then used thematic synthesis to describe the broad themes emerging from this literature.","Initial searches generated 22,375 references, and screening yielded 49, highly heterogeneous, studies that met inclusion criteria, encompassing 12 countries and a variety of settings. The thematic synthesis identified three themes: the first concerned the processes of end-of-life decision-making, highlighting the ambiguity of the dominant shared decision-making process, wherein decisions are determined by families or doctors, sometimes explicitly marginalising the antecedent decisions of patients. Despite this marginalisation, however, the patient does play a role both as a social presence and as an active agent, by whose actions the decisions of those with authority are influenced. The second theme examined the tension between predominant notions of a good death as 'natural' and the drive to medicalise death through the lens of the experiences and actions of those faced with the actuality of death. The final theme considered the concept of antecedent end-of-life decision-making (in all its forms), its influence on policy and decision-making, and some caveats that arise from the studies.","Together these three themes indicate a number of directions for future research, which are likely to be applicable to other conditions that result in reduced agency. Above all, this review emphasises the need for new concepts and fresh approaches to end of life decision-making that address the needs of the growing population of frail older people, people with dementia and those with severe traumatic brain injury."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Birchley","ForeName":"Giles","Initials":"G","Identifier":"0000-0002-2973-2163","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

genotype status and occupational complexity, a measure of cognitive reserve, in individuals with delirium superimposed on dementia; and (2) whether decline in delirium severity was associated with these same factors over a post-acute care (PAC) stay.","Control group data (n\u2009=\u2009142) from a completed randomized clinical trial were used to address the aims of the study. Delirium severity was calculated by combining items from the Confusion Assessment Method and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. APOE \u03b54 carriers versus non-carriers were considered. Occupational complexity, a measure of cognitive reserve, was derived from the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire. Covariates examined included age, gender, education, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, and the Charlson comorbidity score. Data were nested (i.e., days nested within persons) and analyzed using multilevel models.","The presence of an APOE \u03b54 allele and higher Clinical Dementia Rating Scale were associated with greater delirium severity at baseline. The presence of an APOE \u03b54 allele was also associated with greater delirium severity averaged across the PAC stay. Occupational complexity was not associated with baseline delirium severity or average daily delirium severity; however, individuals with low occupational complexity showed a significant decreased in delirium severity during the course of their PAC stay.","Individual differences, including genetic factors and level of cognitive reserve, contribute to the severity of delirium in older adults with dementia.

The current study investigated current referral practices for neuroimaging in dementia, access to imaging modalities and investigated related GP training in Ireland and North Wales.","A questionnaire was distributed to GPs in the programme regions which included approximately two thirds of all GPs in the Republic of Ireland and all general practitioners in North Wales. A total of 2,093 questionnaires were issued.","48.6% of Irish respondents and 24.3% of Welsh respondents directly referred patients with suspected dementia for neuroimaging. Irish GPs reported greater direct access to neuroimaging than their Welsh counterparts. A very small percentage of Irish and Welsh GPs (4.7% and 10% respectively) had received training in neuroimaging and the majority who referred patients for neuroimaging were not aware of any dementia-specific protocols for referrals (93.1% and 95% respectively).","The benefits of direct GP access to neuroimaging investigations for dementia have yet to be established. Our findings suggest that current GP speciality training in Ireland and Wales is deficient in dementia-specific and neuroimaging training with the concern being that inadequate training will lead to inadequate referrals.

Cognitive rehabilitation is a goal-oriented behavioural intervention which focuses on improving everyday functioning through management of cognitive difficulties; it has been shown to be effective in Alzheimer's disease. To date, no studies have assessed its potential efficacy for addressing the impact of cognitive impairment in people with Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies.","Participants (n\u2009=\u200945) will be recruited from movement disorders, care for the elderly and memory clinics. Inclusion criteria include: a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies according to consensus criteria and an Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination - III score of\u2009\u2264\u200982. Exclusion criteria include: a diagnosis of any other significant neurological condition; major psychiatric disorder, including depression, which is not related to the patient's Parkinson's disease and unstable medication use for their physical or cognitive symptoms. A single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial, with concurrent economic evaluation, will compare the relative efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation with that of two control conditions. Following a goal-setting interview, the participants will be randomised to one of the three study arms: cognitive rehabilitation (eight weekly sessions), relaxation therapy (eight weekly sessions) or treatment as usual. Randomisation and treatment group allocation will be carried out by a clinical trials unit using a dynamic adaptive sequential randomisation algorithm. The primary outcomes are patients' perceived goal attainment at a 2-months post-intervention assessment and a 6-months follow-up. Secondary outcomes include patients' objective cognitive performance (on tests of memory and executive function) and satisfaction with goal attainment, carers' perception of patients' goal attainment and patients' and carers' health status and psychosocial well-being, measured at the same time points. Cost-effectiveness will be examined to explore the design of a larger cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a full trial.","This pilot study will evaluate the application of cognitive rehabilitation for the management of cognitive difficulties associated with Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. The results of the study will inform the design of a fully powered randomised controlled trial.","ISRCTN16584442 DOI 10.1186\/ISRCTN16584442 13 April

coping in chronic conditions. Better understanding of the illness representations held by people with dementia could help with targeting information and support so as to optimize adjustment and coping. In this mixed-methods study of illness representations among people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia we aimed to clarify the nature of the representations held, to determine whether specific profiles can be identified based on perceptions of the identity and cause of the condition, and to examine associations between these profiles and other participant characteristics. Data were collected in the second wave of the Memory Impairment and Dementia Awareness Study (MIDAS). Sixty-four people with dementia, who had been told their diagnosis at a memory clinic, completed interviews and responded to questionnaires. In each case a carer was also interviewed. Cluster analysis based on responses about identity and cause identified three profiles. 'Illness' cluster participants saw themselves as living with an illness and used diagnostic labels, 'ageing' cluster participants did not use diagnostic labels and viewed their difficulties as related to ageing, and 'no problem' cluster participants considered that they did not have any difficulties. 'Illness' cluster participants had better cognition and better awareness, but lower mood, and perceived more practical consequences, than 'ageing' cluster participants. Holding an 'illness' model may not be advantageous. Rather than encouraging adoption of such a model, it may be preferable to target information and select interventions in line with the person's representation profile.

Data from semi-structured interviews with 50 caregivers of people with dementia were analysed using content analysis.","The majority of caregivers gave accounts that appeared to endorse a medical\/diagnostic label, although many used different terms interchangeably. Caregivers differentiated between direct causes and contributory factors, but the predominant explanation was that dementia had a biological cause. Other perceived causes were hereditary factors, ageing, lifestyle, life events and environmental factors. A limited number of caregivers were able to identify things that people with dementia could do to help manage the condition, while others thought nothing could be done. There were varying views about the efficacy of medication.

This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) explored the feasibility of a self-management intervention for people with early-stage dementia.","The participants were people with early-stage dementia (n = 24) and for each participant a caregiver also took part. Participants were randomly allocated to either an eight-week self-management group intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). Assessments were conducted at baseline, three months and six months post-randomization by a researcher blind to group allocation. The primary outcome measure was self-efficacy score at three months.","Thirteen people with dementia were randomized to the intervention and 11 to TAU. Two groups were run, the first consisting of six people with dementia and the second of seven people with dementia. There was a small positive effect on self-efficacy with the intervention group showing gains in self-efficacy compared to the TAU group at three months (d = 0.35), and this was maintained at six months (d = 0.23). In terms of intervention acceptability, attrition was minimal, adherence was good, and satisfaction ratings were high. Feedback from participants was analyzed with content analysis. The findings suggest the positive aspects of the intervention were that it fostered independence and reciprocity, promoted social support, offered information, and provided clinician support.","This study has provided preliminary evidence that self-management may be beneficial for people with early-stage dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"REACH: The Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health,Department of Psychology,College of Life and Environmental Sciences,Exeter University,Exeter,EX4 4QG,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Toms","ForeName":"Gill","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology,Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,LL57 2AS,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Carys","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation,Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,LL57 2PZ,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brand","ForeName":"Andrew","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"North Wales Organization for Randomized Trials in Health,College of Health and Behavior Sciences (CoHABS),Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,LL57 2PZ,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Edwards","ForeName":"Rhiannon Tudor","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation,Bangor University,Bangor,Gwynedd,LL57 2PZ,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sanders","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Glan Traeth Community Team,Glan Traeth CPN office,Royal Alexandra Hospital,Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board,Denbighshire,LL18 3AS,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"REACH: The Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health,Department of Psychology,College of Life and Environmental Sciences,Exeter University,Exeter,EX4 4QG,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"17"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Efficacy"},{"DescriptorName":"Single-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","psychosocial intervention","self-care","self-efficacy","support group"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"1","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26674087","S1041610215002094","10.1017\/S1041610215002094"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26419732","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"09","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1545-7214","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"23","Issue":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Anticholinergic Exposure During Rehabilitation: Cognitive and Physical Function Outcomes in Patients with Delirium Superimposed on Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1250-1258"},"ELocationID":["S1064-7481(15)00208-0","10.1016\/j.jagp.2015.07.004"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["We examined the association between anticholinergic medication exposure and subsequent cognitive and physical function in patients with delirium superimposed on dementia during rehabilitation.

We evaluated a goal-setting intervention aimed at promoting increased cognitive and physical activity and improving mental and physical fitness, diet and health.","This was a pilot randomised controlled trial designed to guide planning for a larger-scale investigation, provide preliminary evidence regarding efficacy, and explore feasibility and acceptability. Primary outcomes were engagement in physical and cognitive activity. Participants aged over 50 living independently in the community were recruited through a community Agewell Centre. Following baseline assessment participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: control (IC) had an interview in which information about activities and health was discussed; goal-setting (GS n\u2009=\u200924) had an interview in which they set behaviour change goals relating to physical, cognitive and social activity, health and nutrition; and goal-setting with mentoring (GM, n\u2009=\u200924) had the goal-setting interview followed by bi-monthly telephone mentoring. Participants and researchers were blinded to group assignment. Participants were reassessed after 12\u00a0months.","Seventy-five participants were randomised (IC n\u2009=\u200927, GS n\u2009=\u200924, GM n\u2009=\u200924). At 12-month follow-up, the two goal-setting groups, taken together (GS n\u2009=\u200921, GM n\u2009=\u200922), increased their level of physical (effect size 0.37) and cognitive (effect size 0.15) activity relative to controls (IC n\u2009=\u200927). In secondary outcomes, the two goal-setting groups taken together achieved additional benefits compared to control (effect sizes\u2009\u2265\u20090.2) in memory, executive function, cholesterol level, aerobic capacity, flexibility, balance, grip strength, and agility. Adding follow-up mentoring produced further benefits compared to goal-setting alone (effect sizes\u2009\u2265\u20090.2) in physical activity, body composition, global cognition and memory, but not in other domains. Implementation of the recruitment procedure, assessment and intervention was found to be feasible and the approach taken was acceptable to participants, with no adverse effects.","A brief, low-cost

the degree of brain pathology and clinical manifestations. Early-life education, midlife social and occupational activities and later-life cognitive and social interactions are associated with a more favourable cognitive trajectory in older people. Previous studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested a possible role for the effects of cognitive reserve, but further research into different proxies for cognitive reserve and longitudinal studies is required. This study examined the effects of cognitive lifestyle on cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of cognition and dementia severity in people with PD.","Baseline assessments of cognition, and of clinical, social and demographic information, were completed by 525 participants with PD. Cognitive assessments were completed by 323 participants at 4-year follow-up. Cognition was assessed using the measures of global cognition dementia severity. Cross-sectional and longitudinal serial analyses of covariance for cognition and binomial regression for dementia were performed.","Higher educational level, socio-economic status and recent social engagement were associated with better cross-sectional global cognition. In those with normal cognition at baseline, higher educational level was associated with better global cognition after 4\u2009years. Increasing age and low levels of a measure of recent social engagement were associated with an increased risk of dementia.","Higher cognitive reserve has a beneficial effect on performance on cognitive tests and a limited effect on cognitive decline and dementia risk in PD."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons,

(MCI) to play an active role in managing their condition. Barlow, Wright, Sheasby, Turner, and Hainsworth have defined self-management as the \"individual's ability to manage the symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences and life style changes inherent in living with a chronic condition.\" Although commonly used in other chronic health conditions, there has been relatively little exploration of the role of self-management in dementia or MCI. This review aimed to identify group-based psychosocial interventions for people with dementia or MCI that incorporate significant elements of self-management. Fifteen interventions were included in the review: 12 for people with dementia and 3 for participants with MCI. In both the dementia and MCI interventions, the most commonly included self-management components were information, communication, and social support, and skills training. The review findings indicate that components of self-management have been incorporated into group-based interventions for people with dementia and MCI. Further studies are needed to address the methodological limitations of the included studies and to determine the effectiveness of self-management interventions with these populations.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, UK catherine.quinn@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Toms","ForeName":"Gill","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Anderson","ForeName":"Daniel","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The Retreat, York, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Appl Gerontol","NlmUniqueID":"8606502","ISSNLinking":"0733-4648"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Dysfunction","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Self-Management","QualifierName":"methods"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","group intervention","psychosocial intervention","self-care","self-efficacy"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2014","Month":"03","Day":"31"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"20"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"29"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"1","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"1","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25608870","0733464814566852","10.1177\/0733464814566852"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25488722","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"10","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1477-7525","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Dec","Day":"09"}},"Title":"Health and quality of life outcomes","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Qual Life Outcomes"},"ArticleTitle":"Care staff and family member perspectives on quality of life in people with very severe dementia in long-term care: a cross-sectional study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"175"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12955-014-0175-3","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Little is known about the quality of life of people with very severe dementia in long-term care settings, and more information is needed about the properties of quality of life measures aimed at this group. In this study we explored the profiles of quality of life generated through proxy ratings by care staff and family members using the Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia (QUALID) scale, examined factors associated with these ratings, and further investigated the psychometric properties of the QUALID.","Proxy ratings of quality of life using the QUALID were obtained for 105 residents with very severe dementia, categorised as meeting criteria for Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) stages 6 or 7, from members of care staff (n\u2009=\u2009105) and family members (n\u2009=\u200973). A range of resident and staff factors were also assessed.","Care staff and family member ratings were similar but were associated with different factors. Care staff ratings were significantly predicted by resident mood and awareness\/responsiveness. Family member ratings were significantly predicted by use of antipsychotic medication. Factor analysis of QUALID scores suggested a two-factor solution for both care staff ratings and family member ratings.","The findings offer novel evidence about predictors of care staff proxy ratings of quality of life and demonstrate that commonly-assessed resident variables explain little of the variability in family members' proxy ratings.

specifically judgements concerning memory task performance or appraisal of everyday memory functioning and also exploring the neuropsychological correlates of such awareness. This was investigated in 76 people with dementia, comprising 46 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 30 patients with vascular dementia (VaD). The Memory Awareness Rating Scale (Clare et al., 2002, Neuropsychol Rehabil, 12, 341-362) was used, which includes an Objective-Judgement Discrepancy (OJD) technique involving comparison of subjective evaluation of performance on specific memory tasks with actual performance, and a Subjective Rating Discrepancy (SRD) technique, which compares self versus informant judgement of everyday memory function. The AD and VaD groups showed lower awareness than a normal control group for both types of measures, the AD group showing less awareness than the VaD group on the OJD measure. Regression analyses supported associations for both groups between memory impairment and the OJD measure and between naming impairment and the SRD measure. The findings are discussed in terms of neurocognitive theories accounting for loss of awareness in dementia.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2014 The British Psychological Society."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morris","ForeName":"Robin G","Initials":"RG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Kings College, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nelis","ForeName":"Sharon M","Initials":"SM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Bangor University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Martyr","ForeName":"Anthony","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Bangor University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Markova","ForeName":"Ivana","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Hull, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Roth","ForeName":"Ilona","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Department of Life Sciences, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Bangor University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Whitaker","ForeName":"Christopher J","Initials":"CJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"North Wales Organisation for Randomised Trials in Health, Bangor University, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Bangor University, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Neuropsychol","NlmUniqueID":"101468753","ISSNLinking":"1748-6645"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Case-Control Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Vascular","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer's disease","Awareness","memory","vascular dementia"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"04"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"15"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25488044","10.1111\/jnp.12062"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25433373","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"10","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1477-7525","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Nov","Day":"30"}},"Title":"Health and quality of life outcomes","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Qual Life Outcomes"},"ArticleTitle":"Improving the experience of dementia and enhancing active life--living well with dementia: study protocol for the IDEAL study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"164"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12955-014-0164-6","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Enabling people with dementia and carers to 'live well' with the condition is a key United Kingdom policy objective.

management of response conflict suggests that being bilingual might contribute to increased cognitive reserve. In support of this, recent evidence indicates that bilinguals develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) later than monolinguals, and may retain an advantage in performance on executive control tasks. We compared age at the time of receiving an AD diagnosis in bilingual Welsh\/English speakers (n\u00a0=\u00a037) and monolingual English speakers (n\u00a0=\u00a049), and assessed the performance of bilinguals (n\u00a0=\u00a024) and monolinguals (n\u00a0=\u00a049) on a range of executive control tasks. There was a non-significant difference in age at the time of diagnosis, with bilinguals being on average 3\u00a0years older than monolinguals, but bilinguals were also significantly more cognitively impaired at the time of diagnosis. There were no significant differences between monolinguals and bilinguals in performance on executive function tests, but bilinguals appeared to show relative strengths in the domain of inhibition and response conflict. Bilingual Welsh\/English speakers with AD do not show a clear advantage in executive function over monolingual English speakers, but may retain some benefits in inhibition and management of response conflict. There may be a delay in onset of AD in Welsh\/English bilinguals, but if so, it is smaller than that found in some other clinical populations. In this Welsh sample, bilinguals with AD came to the attention of services later than monolinguals, and reasons for this pattern could be explored further.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2014 The

health conditions. However, there has been limited exploration of how applicable such an approach is in early stage dementia. In this study we explored the views of people with dementia and family caregivers on the use of self-management in dementia. We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 people with early stage dementia and 11 caregivers. We analyzed transcripts using thematic analysis. We found eight themes in the analysis, and they indicated that self-management occurs in the context of peoples' family and social relationships as well as relationships with professional services. Six of the themes involved barriers to and facilitators of self-management. It is evident from these findings that people with dementia and caregivers use self-management techniques. Their use of such techniques could be enhanced by the development of interventions designed to help people with dementia to develop their self-management skills.

Awareness and the QoL-AD: a cross-sectional study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"94"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1477-7525-12-94","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Self-report quality of life (QoL) measures for people with dementia are widely used as outcome measures in trials of dementia care interventions. Depressed mood, relationship quality and neuropsychiatric symptoms predict scores on these measures, whereas cognitive impairment and functional abilities typically do not. This study examines whether these self-reports are influenced by personality and by the person's awareness of his\/her impairments. A strong negative association between QoL and awareness of deficits would have implications for the validity of self-report in this context and for therapeutic interventions aiming to increase adjustment and coping.","Participants were 101 individuals with early\u2012stage dementia and their family carers participating in the Memory Impairment and Dementia Awareness (MIDAS) Study. QoL was assessed using the QoL-AD scale, and awareness was assessed in relation to memory, activities of daily living and social functioning. Self-concept, conscientiousness, quality of relationship and mood were assessed and a brief neuropsychological battery administered. Carers rated their own stress and well-being and reported on neuropsychiatric symptoms. A series of regression analyses predicting QoL-AD were carried out, identifying key variables in each domain of assessment to take forward to an overall model.","Cognitive impairment was not related to QoL. The final model accounted for 57% of the variance in QoL-AD scores, with significant contributions from depressed mood, severity of irritability shown by the person with dementia, self-concept, quality of relationship (rated by the person with dementia) and male gender. The bivariate relationships of QoL-AD with awareness of memory function, awareness of functional abilities and conscientiousness were mediated by both depressed mood and self-concept.","This study reports the most comprehensive approach to evaluation of awareness to date. Most of the indices of awareness used are not related to self-reported QoL. Discrepancies in evaluative judgements of memory function and functional abilities between people with dementia and carers are related to QoL, but this relationship is mediated by both depressed mood and self-concept, which have a much stronger relationship with QoL. The validity of self-report measures of QoL in people with early stage dementia is supported by these results."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"DSDC

Growing numbers of people with early-stage dementia are contributing accounts that emphasise the benefits of actively engaging in managing the condition. Self-management interventions share the common objectives of educating about the condition, optimising well-being, enhancing control over the situation and enabling people to take more responsibility for managing the condition. Benefits of such an approach can include improved knowledge, self-efficacy, health status, and better performance of self-management behaviours. However, there is only preliminary evidence that people with early-stage dementia can benefit from such interventions.","This feasibility study involves the development of a self-management group intervention for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. This study is a single-site pilot randomised-controlled trial. Forty-two people with early stage dementia, each with a caregiver (family member\/friend), will be randomised to either the self-management group intervention or to treatment as usual.The self-management group intervention will involve eight weekly sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, held at a memory clinic in North Wales. All participants will be re-assessed three and six months post-randomisation. This study is intended to supply an early evaluation of the self-management intervention so that a full scale trial may be powered from the best available evidence. It will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the study design and the recruitment strategies. It will estimate the parameters and confidence intervals for the research questions of interest. The primary outcome of interest is the self-efficacy score of the person with dementia at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for the person with dementia are self-efficacy at six months post-randomisation and cognitive ability, mood and well-being at three and six months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for caregivers are their distress and stress at three and six months post-randomisation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be examined.","This study will provide preliminary information about the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a self-management group

awareness and dementia little can be concluded concerning their relationship and the role of other factors. It is likely that studies capture different phenomena of awareness. This study aimed at identifying and delineating such variation by analysing data from three questionnaires obtained during the longitudinal study of awareness in 101 people with early-stage dementia. The data concerned awareness in relation to memory, activities of daily living and socio-emotional function. Significant differences in patterns of discrepancies were obtained. This suggests that the awareness phenomena involved were structurally different; and that, in turn, this may reflect variation in the intrinsic linking between awareness and its 'object' (different 'objects' determining different kinds of judgements). The identification of such differences is necessary so that appropriate methodologies can be applied to the study of awareness in different contexts.

We interviewed 12 family caregivers of relatives with dementia. We analysed transcripts of these interviews using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Six key themes emerged from the analysis, which were encompassed under an overarching theme of 'balancing needs'. This describes the caregivers' constant struggle to balance their own needs against those of their relative, which created a series of dilemmas. These dilemmas emerged from the desire to try to preserve the caregivers' relationship with their relative, while recognising that this relationship was changing. The caregivers' relationship with their relative influenced the caregivers' motivations to provide care and gave caregiving meaning. Although caregivers were motivated to provide care the battle to balance needs meant that the caregivers recognised there might come a time when they may need to cease caregiving.

This systematic review explores the relevance of attachment for people with dementia, and how attachment influences the experience of caregivers of people with dementia. Eighteen studies were included. Three focused on attachment in terms of parent fixation in dementia, three examined attachment behaviour in dementia, five addressed attachment and dementia-related behavioural problems, and seven concentrated on attachment in caregivers. Attachment behaviours were evident at various stages of dementia and the presence of parent fixation was observed when attachment needs were not being met. Insecure attachment was related to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Attachment security had important consequences for caregiver psychological health.

The aim of the current study was to explore how the members work together with this triadic context. Six spousal caregiving dyads and the three Admiral Nurses who worked with the couples were interviewed. Transcripts of these interviews were analysed to form six case studies, each containing the perspectives of the three members of the triad. The processes emerging in these case studies were encompassed under an overarching dynamic process of 'negotiating the balance'. This describes the ongoing struggle of the members to balance the views of the other members against their own needs. Coalitions could occur as members worked together to tackle problems. The findings of this study highlight the importance of exploring the perspectives of all members of the triad.

We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the recently updated Wechsler Memory Scale verbal paired associates (VPA) in distinguishing the earliest stages of memory impairment (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI), and the clinical application at the case level, compared with other episodic memory tasks. Participants were 77 people with aMCI and 77 matched healthy older adults (HOA). VPA performance distinguished aMCI from HOA at the group level with large effect sizes, of similar size to the other tasks at immediate recall, but smaller than the CVLT-II list-learning task at delayed recall. Similarly, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated good discrimination, similar to other tasks, but again with CVLT-II more accurate at delayed recall. Although group differences remained for normative data, on a case basis using existing normative data the VPA failed to identify 70% of aMCI as impaired. The findings suggest further examination of the normative data is required before the VPA is useful in clinical practice, and highlight the importance of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment in detecting mild memory changes in older adults.

Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. The unit of analysis in the meta-analysis was the change from baseline score. Overall estimates of treatment effect were calculated using a fixed-effect model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured using a standard Chi(2) statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing examination of effect sizes, but no meta-analysis could be conducted.","Cognitive training was not associated with positive or negative effects in relation to any reported outcomes. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate. The single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation found promising results in relation to a number of participant and caregiver outcomes, and was generally of high quality.","Available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. However, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. The results of the single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. Further, well-designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence.

a clinically effective intervention for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, vascular or mixed dementia and their carers. This study aims to establish whether CR is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for people with early-stage dementia and their carers.","In this multi-centre, single-blind randomised controlled trial, 480 people with early-stage dementia, each with a carer, will be randomised to receive either treatment as usual or cognitive rehabilitation (10 therapy sessions over 3 months, followed by 4 maintenance sessions over 6 months). We will compare the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation with that of treatment as usual with regard to improving self-reported and carer-rated goal performance in areas identified as causing concern by people with early-stage dementia; improving quality of life, self-efficacy, mood and cognition of people with early-stage dementia; and reducing stress levels and ameliorating quality of life for carers of participants with early-stage dementia. The incremental cost-effectiveness of goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation compared to treatment as usual will also be examined.","If the study confirms the benefits and cost-effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation, it will be important to examine how the goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation approach can most effectively be integrated into routine health-care provision. Our aim is to provide training and develop materials to support the implementation of this approach following trial completion."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of

based on evaluative judgement and performance monitoring are often regarded as equivalent, but the Levels of Awareness Framework suggests they reflect different awareness phenomena. Examination of memory awareness among groups with differing degrees of impairment provides a test of this proposition.","Ninety-nine people with dementia (PwD), 30 people with mild cognitive impairment (PwMCI), and their relatives completed isomorphic performance monitoring and evaluative judgement measures of memory awareness and were followed up at 12 and (PwD only) 20 months. In addition to the resulting awareness indices, comparative accuracy scores were calculated using the relatives' data to establish whether any inaccuracy was specific to self-ratings.","When making evaluative judgements about their memory in general, both PwD and PwMCI tended to overestimate their own functioning relative to informant ratings made by relatives.

For both groups, there were no associations between different aspects of identity. People in the early stages of dementia do not differ much from healthy older adults in terms of their identity.

MRI also yielded the highest number of studies with extractable data for meta-analysis (n = 32 [46% of all structural MRI studies]), followed by cerebrospinal fluid tau (n = 24 [73%]). There were few studies on positron emission tomography ligands for amyloid having suitable data for meta-analysis (n = 4). There was considerable variation across studies in reporting outcomes, methods of blinding and selection, means of accounting for indeterminate or missing values, the interval between the test and assessments, and the determination of test thresholds.","The body of evidence for biomarkers is not large and is variable across the different types of biomarkers. Important information is missing from many study reports, highlighting the need for standardization of methodology and reporting to improve the rigor of biomarker validation."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 The Alzheimer's Association.

All these factors were significantly related to caregiving outcomes as measured by caregiver burden, role captivity, and competence.","Based on these findings, it is recommended that interventions aimed at reducing caregiving stress should take into account the impact of the quality of the relationship and the caregivers' motivations for providing care. More longitudinal research is needed to explore how meanings, motivations, and relationship quality change over the caregiving career."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, UK. catherine.quinn@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McGuinness","ForeName":"Ted","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"06","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["classification","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cost of Illness"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Emotional Intelligence"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Motivation"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Adjustment"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"6","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"6","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"2","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22652014","S1041610212000889","10.1017\/S1041610212000889"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22572810","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2012","Month":"06","Day":"22"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"33","Issue":"2-3","PubDate":{"Year":"2012"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Executive function and activities of daily living in Alzheimer's disease: a correlational meta-analysis.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"189-203"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000338233","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The assessment of executive function (EF) and activities of daily living (ADL) are important elements in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.","Following a comprehensive search in three databases, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to investigate the association between ADL ability and seventeen tests of EF, three tests of attention and working memory and the Mini-Mental State Examination.

We developed an observational tool, AwareCare, which care staff can use to identify signs of awareness in residents with very severe dementia, based on the concept of the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM). Using WHIM items as a guide, and following focus groups with care staff and family members, an expert panel identified 28 environmental stimuli and 35 response categories for the initial version of AwareCare. After baseline assessments of cognition, well-being and quality of life were taken, 40 residents were observed individually for 30 minutes on 5 occasions. Based on the observational data, 10 stimulus categories and 14 response categories were identified for further analysis and formed the final version of AwareCare. All participants showed awareness to varying degrees. Social stimuli elicited the most responses. Greater awareness was associated with better cognitive function, self-care, mobility, and responsiveness, but not with proxy-rated quality of life. Understanding the nature of awareness in this group is an important element in ensuring appropriate levels of interaction and stimulation, and hence enhancing quality of care."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Whitaker","ForeName":"Rhiannon","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jelley","ForeName":"Hannah","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hoare","ForeName":"Zoe","Initials":"Z"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilson","ForeName":"Barbara","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"G0701817","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Validation Study"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Neuropsychol Rehabil","NlmUniqueID":"9112672","ISSNLinking":"0960-2011"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["classification","nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Vascular","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":"instrumentation"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"5","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22264147","10.1080\/09602011.2011.640467"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21995710","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"02"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1464-0686","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"19","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Memory (Hove, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Memory"},"ArticleTitle":"Exploring the basis and boundary conditions of SenseCam-facilitated recollection.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"758-67"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/09658211.2010.533180","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"SenseCam review has been shown to promote and sustain subsequent access to memories that might otherwise remain inaccessible. While SenseCam review facilitates recollection for personally experienced events, we know little about the boundary conditions under which this operates and about how underlying processing mechanisms can be optimally recruited to offset memory impairments of the sort that occur in dementia. This paper considers some of these issues with a view to targeting future research that not only clarifies our evolving body of theory about how memory works, but also informs about how memory-assistive technologies for patients might be employed to maximal effect. We begin by outlining key factors that are known to influence recollection. We then examine variability in the decline of memory function both in normal ageing and in dementia. Attention is drawn to similarities in the recollection deficits associated with depression and dementia, and we suggest that this may reflect shared underlying mechanisms. We conclude by discussing how one particular theoretical rationale can be intersected with key SenseCam capabilities to define priorities for ongoing and future SenseCam research."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Barnard","ForeName":"Philip J","Initials":"PJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"MRC

PwD completed neuropsychological tests and measures of mood and quality of life. Carers completed measures of mood and stress. At initial assessment, discrepancies were greatest for activities of daily living, moderate for memory, and least pronounced for socio-emotional functioning. Discrepancy scores did not change over time. PwD self-ratings indicated perceived poorer functioning in everyday activities over time, but no change for memory and socio-emotional functioning. Carer ratings indicated perceived decline in everyday activities and socio-emotional functioning, but no change for memory. PwD declined in neuropsychological functioning, but self-ratings of depression, anxiety, and quality of life remained stable over time. Carer mood and stress levels also remained stable.

Within an integrative biopsychosocial model that acknowledges the influence of neurocognitive, psychological, and social variables on awareness, challenges for empirical research on awareness in dementia are addressed, and a 'levels of awareness' framework is presented within which awareness operates at four levels of increasing complexity, providing a means of differentiating among awareness phenomena. Approaches to mapping awareness phenomena are discussed, and directions for future research and clinical practice are outlined.","The levels of awareness framework should act as a stimulus to further research in this area, resulting in a more coherent understanding of the nature of awareness deficits, the implications of these for people with dementia and their caregivers, and the possibilities for targeted and effective interventions."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Gwynedd, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Markov\u00e1","ForeName":"Ivana S","Initials":"IS"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Roth","ForeName":"Ilona","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morris","ForeName":"Robin G","Initials":"RG"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"06","Day":"27"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Concept Formation"},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Denial, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Theoretical"},{"DescriptorName":"Research"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"6","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"6","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"3","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21702711","10.1080\/13607863.2011.583630"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21685780","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"09","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2012","Month":"05","Day":"21"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1546-4156","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"26","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2012 Apr-Jun"}},"Title":"Alzheimer disease and associated disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Marital relationship quality in early-stage dementia: perspectives from people with dementia and their spouses.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"148-58"},"ELocationID":"10.1097\/WAD.0b013e318221ba23","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Spouse caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) report relatively poor marital relationship quality (RQ), but few studies have obtained the perspective of the PwD, examined discrepancies between spouses, or considered changes in RQ over time. This study explored caregiver and PwD perceptions of RQ, identified associated factors, and examined changes over an 18-month period. Participants were 54 couples where one spouse had early-stage dementia and 54 were control couples. RQ was assessed with the Positive Affect Index. Measures of mood, stress, and quality of life (QoL) were also administered. The clinical couples were followed up after 9 and 18 months. Caregivers gave significantly lower RQ ratings than controls. PwD ratings did not differ significantly from those of caregivers or controls. Dyadic discrepancies were significantly greater in the clinical than in the control group. Caregiver ratings were associated with stress, whereas PwD ratings were associated with depression and QoL. Discrepancies were associated with caregiver stress and with PwD mood, QoL, and age. Caregiver ratings declined significantly over time; PwD ratings did not decline significantly, but showed different trends for men and women.

Delirium is common and deadly in older adults with dementia, and is often referred to as delirium superimposed on dementia, or DSD. Interventions that treat DSD are not well-developed because the mechanisms involved in its etiology are not completely understood. We have developed a theory-based intervention for DSD that is derived from the literature on cognitive reserve and based on our prior interdisciplinary work on delirium, recreational activities, and cognitive stimulation in people with dementia. Our preliminary work indicate that use of simple, cognitively stimulating activities may help resolve delirium by helping to focus inattention, the primary neuropsychological deficit in delirium. Our primary aim in this trial is to test the efficacy of Recreational Stimulation for Elders as a Vehicle to resolve DSD (RESERVE- DSD).","This randomized repeated measures clinical trial will involve participants being recruited and enrolled at the time of admission to post acute care. We will randomize 256 subjects to intervention (RESERVE-DSD) or control (usual care). Intervention subjects will receive 30-minute sessions of tailored cognitively stimulating recreational activities for up to 30 days. We hypothesize that subjects who receive RESERVE-DSD will have: decreased severity and duration of delirium; greater gains in attention, orientation, memory, abstract thinking, and executive functioning; and greater gains in physical function compared to subjects with DSD who receive usual care. We will also evaluate potential moderators of intervention efficacy (lifetime of complex mental activities and APOE status). Our secondary aim is to describe the costs associated with RESERVE-DSD.","Our theory-based intervention, which uses simple, inexpensive recreational activities for delivering cognitive stimulation, is innovative because, to our knowledge it has not been tested as a treatment for DSD. This novel intervention for DSD builds on our prior delirium, recreational activity and cognitive stimulation research, and draws support from cognitive reserve theory.","ClinicalTrials.gov

Independently, the two intervention types have been found to improve functional performance in people with dementia. The mechanisms underpinning these improvements come from comparable and diverse pathways. This suggests that it may be beneficial for the two intervention types to be coupled as part of regular care in individuals with a range of cognitive impairments. The aims of this review are threefold. The first aim is to present evidence to support the use for combining exercise and cognition-focused interventions. This will be achieved by reviewing the mechanisms of both approaches in improving functional performance in older people and in people with dementia and summarising recent progress. The increased risk of depression, falls and cardiovascular disease risk in people with dementia will also be highlighted. The second aim is to discuss the parameters of the two approaches that should be considered when combining them in terms of possible efficient models, especially in relation to exercise protocols as this is where the current literature shows the most promising outcomes. Maximisation of the efficacy of preventative and treatment interventions which focus on both cognitive functioning and physical health should lead to improving and extending functional independence. Key aspects of any combined intervention would involve the inclusion of both cardiovascular and other types of exercises, including falls reduction, and exercises addressing memory and executive function via goal setting in the real-life context. The third aim is to explore some of the issues that may arise when attempting to incorporate interventions into the regular treatment of people with dementia. Consideration must also be given to caregivers and the education of health professionals as well as to the mode of intervention itself. Further research is necessary in order to discern the most effective types of both intervention models. Provision of combined interventions might enhance the improvements in functional independence in people with dementia over and above the interventions being used separately.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2010 S.

One reason for this may be the assumption that people with severe dementia are unaware of what is happening to them. However, there is converging evidence to suggest that global assumptions of unawareness are inappropriate. This trial platform study aims to assist care staff in perceiving and responding to subtle signs of awareness and thus enhance their practice.","In Stage One, a measure of awareness in severe dementia will be developed. Two focus groups and an expert panel will contribute to item and scale development. In Stage Two observational data will be used to further develop the measure. Working in four care homes, we will recruit 40 individuals with severe dementia who have no, or very limited, verbal communication. Data on inter-rater reliability and frequency of all items and exploratory factor analysis will be used to identify items to be retained. Test-retest and inter-rater reliability for the new measure will be calculated. Correlations with scores for well-being and behaviour and with proxy ratings of quality of life will provide an indication of concurrent validity. In Stage Three the new measure will be used in a single blind cluster randomised trial. Eight care homes will participate, with 10 residents recruited in each giving a total sample of 80 people with severe dementia. Homes will be randomised to intervention or usual care conditions. In the intervention condition, staff will receive training in using the new measure and will undertake observations of designated residents. For residents with dementia, outcomes will be assessed in terms of change from baseline in scores for behaviour, well-being and quality of life. For care staff, outcomes will be assessed in terms of change from baseline in scores for attitudes, care practice, and well-being.","The results will inform the design of a larger-scale trial intended to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of increasing the sensitivity of care staff to signs of awareness in residents with severe dementia.","ISRCTN59507580 http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Gwynedd LL57 2AS, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Whitaker","ForeName":"Rhiannon","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilson","ForeName":"Barbara A","Initials":"BA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN59507580"}}},"GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"G0701817","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"06","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Trials","NlmUniqueID":"101263253","ISSNLinking":"1745-6215"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication Barriers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Single-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Staff Development","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2010","Month":"04","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2010","Month":"06","Day":"25"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"6","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"6","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"9","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20579370","1745-6215-11-73","10.1186\/1745-6215-11-73","PMC2908603"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Age Ageing. 1993 May;22(3):183-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8503314"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 1982 Sep;139(9):1136-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7114305"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Nov;9(6):535-41","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16214701"}},{"Citation":"Int J Nurs Stud. 1991;28(1):65-75","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"1856035"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Sep;9(5):394-413","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16024399"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2005 Oct;45 Spec No 1(1):133-46","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16230760"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2005 Oct;45 Spec No 1(1):96-105","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16230756"}},{"Citation":"J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci. 1999 May;54(3):P180-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10363040"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2002 Mar;14(1):25-38","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12094904"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Sep;9(5):414-22","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16024400"}},{"Citation":"Br J Clin Psychol. 2004 Jun;43(Pt 2):177-96","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15169617"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2005 Oct;45 Spec No 1(1):11-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16230745"}},{"Citation":"Psychopharmacol Bull. 1988;24(4):653-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"3249767"}},{"Citation":"Geriatr Nurs. 2001 Mar-Apr;22(2):106-10","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11326220"}},{"Citation":"Int J Nurs Stud. 2003 Jul;40(5):473-9;

In this article we propose a theory-based intervention for DSD that is derived from the literature on cognitive reserve and neuroplasticity. We begin by defining cognitive reserve, the guiding framework for our hypothesis. We review the pathophysiology and neuropsychology of delirium noting the similarities with dementia-these two conditions reflecting acute and chronic reductions in cognitive reserve, respectively. We then review the evidence for activity-dependent plasticity as a possible mechanism for sparing cognitive reserve in dementia and its potential for addressing DSD. Cognitive training (CT) in the form of stimulating activities has been shown to evoke cognitive processing and facilitate plasticity in dementia. Because of the similarities between dementia and delirium, the use of recreational activities as a vehicle for supporting attentional capacity, and delivering cognitive stimulation, may hold promise for the resolution of DSD. Based on integrated evidence from the literature, we hypothesize that engagement in cognitively stimulating recreational activities will help reduce delirium severity and duration in persons with dementia while providing improved quality of life and reduced costs of care."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kolanowski","ForeName":"Ann M","Initials":"AM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing, Pennsylvania State University, 106 Health & Human Development East, University Park, PA 16802, USA. amk20@psu.edu"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fick","ForeName":"Donna M","Initials":"DM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Therrien","ForeName":"Barbara","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gill","ForeName":"David J","Initials":"DJ"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"R01 NR011042","Acronym":"NR","Agency":"NINR NIH HHS","Country":"United States"},{"GrantID":"R01 NR012242","Acronym":"NR","Agency":"NINR NIH HHS","Country":"United States"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Delirium","QualifierName":["complications","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Leisure Activities","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Theoretical"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuronal Plasticity"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"3","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"3","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"4","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20336555","920247029","10.1080\/13607860903167853"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"20301007","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"10","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2010","Month":"11","Day":"18"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1744-4128","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2010"}},"Title":"Neuropsychology, development, and cognition.

The primary outcome measure of the study is the change from baseline in the total score on the Cambridge Cognitive Score (CAMCOG). Secondary outcomes of interest include changes in memory, attention, executive functions, mood and quality of life. Primary endpoints will be collected 12, 52 and 104 weeks after the baseline assessment.","The proposed project will produce the best available evidence on the merits of increased cognitive activity as a strategy to prevent cognitive decline among older adults with MCI. We anticipate that the results of this study will have implications for the development of evidence-based preventive strategies to reduce the rate of cognitive decline amongst older people at risk of dementia.","ACTRN12608000556347."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vidovich","ForeName":"Mandy

persist in people with dementia. The aim of this systematic review was to examine methods currently used to investigate self and identity in people with dementia, and the resulting evidence as to the persistence of self and identity throughout the course of the disease. Thirty-three studies were reviewed, which showed that many approaches have been taken to studying aspects of self and identity in dementia, including both quantitative and qualitative methods. This appears to be partly due to the differing underlying concepts of self that have been used as a basis for these studies. Consequently, results obtained from these studies are somewhat disparate, although it is possible to draw some tentative conclusions from the available evidence. Almost all of the studies suggest that there is at least some evidence for persistence of self in both the mild and moderate to severe stages of the illness, although many studies record some degree of deterioration in aspects of self or identity. Further research is required to clarify existing evidence and to address outstanding questions regarding self and identity in dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Caddell","ForeName":"Lisa S","Initials":"LS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, UK. psp685@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Clin Psychol Rev","NlmUniqueID":"8111117","ISSNLinking":"0272-7358"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Recall","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"58"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2009","Month":"06","Day":"04"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2009","Month":"10","Day":"06"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2009","Month":"10","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19896760","S0272-7358(09)00139-1","10.1016\/j.cpr.2009.10.003"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19847071","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"01","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"10","Day":"22"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0922-6028","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2009"}},"Title":"Restorative neurology and neuroscience","ISOAbbreviation":"Restor Neurol Neurosci"},"ArticleTitle":"Can we change brain functioning with cognition-focused interventions in Alzheimer's disease?

Reduced awareness may serve a protective function against the threats to self posed by the onset and progression of dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Naylor","ForeName":"Emma","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Wales Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Neuropsychol Rehabil","NlmUniqueID":"9112672","ISSNLinking":"0960-2011"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Analysis of Variance"},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Eidetic Imagery","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":"etiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Personality Inventory"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Statistics as Topic"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"10","Day":"17","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"4","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"10","Day":"17","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18924000","786626811","10.1080\/09602010701608681"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18325650","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"08","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0277-9536","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"66","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Social science & medicine (1982)","ISOAbbreviation":"Soc Sci Med"},"ArticleTitle":"'I don't do like I used to do': a grounded theory approach to conceptualising awareness in people with moderate to severe dementia living in long-term care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2366-77"},"ELocationID":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2008.01.045","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"While awareness among people with mild to moderate dementia residing in the community has been extensively studied, little evidence has been presented regarding the extent to which people with moderate to severe dementia living in residential care show awareness of their own situation and functioning. The present study aimed to explore how differing degrees of awareness are manifested in the conversations and interactions of people with dementia living in residential care settings, and to identify theoretical and practical implications. Transcripts of 304 conversations with 80 individuals with dementia living in residential care homes in England and Wales were analysed using a grounded theory approach. All 80 participants demonstrated a degree of retained awareness, and there was considerable evidence of retained awareness throughout the conversations, expressed in relation to the three domains of self, relationship, and the environmental context. Two-thirds of participants also demonstrated at least one instance of unawareness, although demonstrations of retained awareness outweighed indications of unawareness. Unawareness was evident in relation to appraisal of functioning and the meaning ascribed to the situation. A grounded theory model of awareness in people with moderate to severe dementia who still communicate verbally proposes that demonstration of awareness involves a set of analytic and behavioural processes, a scope or timescale, and a focus. Awareness is demonstrated in relation to a given focus and scope through the involvement of cognitive processes of varying degrees of complexity, ranging from registering through appraising and interpreting to reflection. Unawareness may be demonstrated in relation to some elements of process, focus or scope, while other aspects remain unaffected. Understanding more about the capacity for retained awareness and the specific ways in which awareness can be compromised may assist care staff in responding effectively to residents' needs."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rowlands","ForeName":"Julia","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bruce","ForeName":"Errollyn","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Soc Sci Med","NlmUniqueID":"8303205","ISSNLinking":"0277-9536"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Ego"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"23"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"8","Day":"30","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18325650","S0277-9536(08)00045-2","10.1016\/j.socscimed.2008.01.045"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18247118","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"07","Day":"09"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1040-7308","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Neuropsychology review","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuropsychol Rev"},"ArticleTitle":"Errorless learning in the rehabilitation of memory impairment: a critical review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1-23"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s11065-008-9051-4","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This review considers the origins of the errorless learning (EL) concept, its application in memory rehabilitation, the evidence for its effectiveness, and the theoretical basis for the observed findings.

Twenty three AD patients and age-matched controls named pictures of objects and actions and took part in a word-picture verification task. The results for picture naming revealed that both patients and controls were faster and produced more target responses for objects than actions. In the comprehension task, accuracy levels were comparable for nouns and verbs, but response times were longer for verbs. Although patients were more error prone and had longer latencies in both tasks than controls, the only qualitative difference in performance between the groups was in response to trials with semantically related foils in the word-picture verification task. Patients were particularly error prone in this condition. We conclude that the results do not provide support for the notion that verbs are selectively preserved in AD. They also do not provide conclusive evidence for claims that depressed naming and comprehension is (always) due to loss of semantic knowledge or inadequate access to semantic knowledge.

Cognitive conceptualisation, neural correlates, and diagnostic relevance of impaired memory for faces and names.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"898-906"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Memory for faces and names has increasingly become a focus of cognitive assessment and research in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper reviews evidence from cognitive and clinical neuroscience regarding the question of whether AD is associated with a specific deficit in face recognition, face-name association, and retrieval of semantic information and names. Cognitive approaches conceptualizing face recognition and face-name association have revealed that, compared to other types of visual stimuli, faces are \"special\" because of their complexity and high intraclass similarity, and because their association with proper names is arbitrary and unique. Neuroimaging has revealed that due to this particular status, face perception requires a complex interplay of highly specialized secondary visual areas located in the occipitotemporal cortex with a widely distributed system of cortical areas subserving further task-dependent processing. Our review of clinical research suggests that AD-related deficits in face recognition are primarily due to mnestic rather than perceptual deficits. Memory for previously studied or famous faces is closely related to mediotemporal and temporocortical brain regions subserving episodic and semantic memory in general, suggesting that AD-related impairments in this domain are due to neural degeneration in these areas. Despite limited specificity due to the apparent absence of a \"genuine\" domain-specific deficit of face memory in AD, testing memory for faces and names is useful in clinical contexts, as it provides highly sensitive indices of episodic and semantic memory performance. Therefore, clinical assessment of face memory can usefully contribute to early detection of memory deficits in prodromal and initial stages of AD, and represents a basis for further attempts at rehabilitation. Further advantages, such as ecological validity, high task comprehensibility and, in the case of novel face learning, independence from premorbid intelligence level, render measures of face recognition valuable for clinical assessment in early AD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Werheid","ForeName":"Katja","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Humboldt-University at Berlin, Berlin, Germany. katja.werheid@cms.hu-berlin.de"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Italy","MedlineTA":"Cortex","NlmUniqueID":"0100725","ISSNLinking":"0010-9452"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Concept Formation"},{"DescriptorName":"Face"},{"DescriptorName":"Facial Expression"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Names"},{"DescriptorName":"Recognition, Psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Retention, Psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Verbal Behavior"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"90"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"10","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"6","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"10","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17941348","S0010-9452(08)70689-0","10.1016\/s0010-9452(08)70689-0"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17852759","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"05","Day":"02"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2008","Month":"03","Day":"12"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0960-2011","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"Neuropsychological rehabilitation","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuropsychol Rehabil"},"ArticleTitle":"Learning face-name associations in early-stage dementia: comparing the effects of errorless learning and effortful processing.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"735-54"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Some recent studies suggest that errorless learning principles may be beneficial in memory rehabilitation for people with dementia, while others indicate that effortful processing may be more important. The present study compared the effects of four different learning techniques, varying in level of effort required and number of errors elicited, on free recall, cued recall and recognition of novel and previously known associations among people with early-stage dementia. Ten participants with a diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer's, vascular or mixed dementia learned novel and previously familiar face-name associations with each of four techniques--vanishing cues, forward cues, target selection, and paired associate learning--in a within-subjects design. All conditions produced significant learning for both novel and familiar associations. There were no significant differences between conditions, although mean scores were slightly higher for errorful conditions. Reducing errors did not produce any benefits. Enhancing level of effort had no significant effects for familiar associations, but high-effort conditions were significantly more effective than low-effort conditions in facilitating cued recall of novel associations.

We tested the hypothesis put forward in (some) previous studies that in Alzheimer's dementia the production of verbs, that is required in action naming, is better preserved than the production of nouns, that is required in object naming. The possible reason for the dissociation is that verbs are supported predominantly by frontal brain structures that may remain relatively better preserved in early Alzheimer's disease. Objects, on the other hand, are supported by temporal lobe structures that are affected early in the disease. An alternative hypothesis, which is supported by other studies, is that action naming is more impaired than object naming due to verbs being semantically more complex than nouns. In order to test these contrasting hypotheses, the present study used more stringent methodology than previous studies. We used a larger set of stimuli with carefully matched object and action items and we collected not only accuracy data but also naming latencies, a measure that is sensitive to even mild lexical retrieval problems. We compared the performance of 19 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease with that of 19 healthy age matched participants. We found that both the patients and the comparison group responded faster and made fewer errors on the object pictures than the action pictures. A qualitative analysis of the naming errors indicated that object and action naming pose different demands for the language system. The results overall suggest that the patients' performance is an exaggeration of the pattern present in the comparison participants."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Druks","ForeName":"Judit","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University College, and Whittington Hospital, London, UK. j.druks@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Masterson","ForeName":"Jackie","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kopelman","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rose","ForeName":"Anita","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rai","ForeName":"Gucharan","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"Agency":"Wellcome Trust","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2006","Month":"07","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Brain Lang","NlmUniqueID":"7506220","ISSNLinking":"0093-934X"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"epidemiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Names"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Reaction Time"},{"DescriptorName":"Semantics"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2005","Month":"08","Day":"15"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2006","Month":"04","Day":"28"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2006","Month":"06","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"2","Day":"7","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16843522","S0093-934X(06)00116-7","10.1016\/j.bandl.2006.06.003"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16565033","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"06","Day":"08"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0960-2011","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Neuropsychological rehabilitation","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuropsychol Rehabil"},"ArticleTitle":"Measuring awareness in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: development of the Memory Awareness Rating Scale--adjusted.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"178-93"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Variations in level of awareness among people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may impact on well-being for the person with dementia and their carer, and may influence outcomes of cognitive rehabilitation interventions. Awareness has often been assessed using discrepancies between self and proxy rating or between self-rating and objective task performance, with the latter considered to be preferable. Measures are available that are suitable for people with mild AD, for example the Memory Awareness Rating Scale (MARS). However, these may be less appropriate for people whose impairments are more advanced and who consequently have more difficulty with the objective task component. In order to provide a measure suitable for people with moderate AD, an adjusted Memory Awareness Rating Scale (MARSA) was developed by altering the objective task component of the MARS. The MARSA was piloted with 41 participants with mild to moderate AD. It was found to be suitable for use with a broader group of participants than the MARS. The component ratings were found to have good internal consistency. The component ratings and the two indices of awareness had high test-retest reliability. The extension of the original measure offers the opportunity to consider awareness throughout the course of the disease and provides a basis for longitudinal investigations of awareness."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hardy","ForeName":"Rachel M","Initials":"RM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan R","Initials":"JR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Neuropsychol Rehabil","NlmUniqueID":"9112672","ISSNLinking":"0960-2011"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Disability Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Weights and Measures"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"28","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"6","Day":"9","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"28","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16565033","T5Q572T5H483LWU3","10.1080\/09602010500145646"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16513992","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"05","Day":"16"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2007","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1049-7323","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Qualitative health research","ISOAbbreviation":"Qual Health Res"},"ArticleTitle":"Illness representations and lived experience in early-stage dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"484-502"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The self-regulation model of illness behavior provides a framework for understanding how threats to self from chronic illness can be managed and proposes a significant role for illness representations.

Apathy and psychosis are frequently present in patients with less awareness, and may share common neuropathological substrates with awareness.

One of the reasons underlying variability in study results relates to the complexities around the concept of awareness itself. Two sources of conceptual problems are explored. First, the meaning of awareness is examined and, within the dementia literature, various conceptualizations of awareness are identified which could be traced to three broad frameworks within which awareness and related terms are conceived. Differences between meanings of awareness are thus highlighted and the importance of making such differences explicit in studies was discussed. Second, the relational aspect of awareness is raised as a crucial issue determining the phenomenon of awareness elicited in clinical practice. Thus, in dementia, awareness is related to various \"objects\" including the illness as a whole, memory problems, activities of daily living, affective changes and many others. In each case, however, the object of awareness will elicit a different phenomenon of awareness, again carrying implications for the generalizability of study results. Clarification of conceptual problems is essential for future work in this area in order that empirical studies can provide meaningful answers concerning the therapeutic and predictive validity of different aspects of awareness."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Markov\u00e1","ForeName":"Ivana S","Initials":"IS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, University of Hull, UK. ismarkova@psych.hi-net.co.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wang","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Romero","ForeName":"Barbara","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kenny","ForeName":"Geraldine","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Affect"},{"DescriptorName":"Biomedical Research","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatry","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics"},{"DescriptorName":"Reference Values"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"7","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"7","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16024398","W122263401757805","10.1080\/13607860500142945"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16024397","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1360-7863","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"9","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Awareness in dementia: a subject for scrutiny.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"384-5"},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, University of Wales Bangor, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"7","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"7","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16024397","GH0678JV2TM71031","10.1080\/13607860500142887"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15202541","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"07","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1380-3395","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"26","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology","ISOAbbreviation":"J Clin Exp Neuropsychol"},"ArticleTitle":"Awareness in early-stage Alzheimer's disease: relationship to outcome of cognitive rehabilitation.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"215-26"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Awareness of difficulties may have an important impact on functioning and response to intervention in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinical reports and retrospective studies suggest an association, but this has not previously been tested in a prospective study. Using a new measure of awareness, the Memory Awareness Rating Scale (MARS), which was designed to take account of methodological limitations identified in a review of previous studies, the present study explored the relationship between awareness of difficulties and outcome of a cognitive rehabilitation (CR) intervention in 12 participants with a diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer's disease. The relationship between awareness and mood, behaviour and executive function was also assessed. The results provide the first demonstration in a prospective study that higher levels of awareness are related to better CR outcomes. Awareness was associated with depression and reported behaviour problems, but not with performance on tests of executive function. These results suggest that variations in level of awareness in early-stage AD are influenced by psychological factors, and that explanatory models need to take these factors into account. Awareness of difficulties may serve as a useful predictor of the likely effectiveness of CR, andthis may assist clinicians in selecting appropriate interventions for individuals with early-stage AD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Sub-department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK. l.clare@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilson","ForeName":"Barbara A","Initials":"BA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carter","ForeName":"Gina","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Roth","ForeName":"Ilona","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hodges","ForeName":"John R","Initials":"JR"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"G9724461","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Clinical Trial","Comparative Study","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Clin Exp Neuropsychol","NlmUniqueID":"8502170","ISSNLinking":"1380-3395"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["etiology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Retrospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"6","Day":"19","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"20","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"6","Day":"19","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15202541","10.1076\/jcen.26.2.215.28088"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15169617","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"10","Day":"07"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0144-6657","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"43","Issue":"Pt 2","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"The British journal of clinical psychology","ISOAbbreviation":"Br J Clin Psychol"},"ArticleTitle":"Awareness in early-stage Alzheimer's disease: a review of methods and evidence.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"177-196"},"ELocationID":"10.1348\/014466504323088042","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This review has three main aims: (1) To illustrate the strengths and limitations of current approaches to assessing awareness of difficulties and impairments in people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD).

There is an extensive literature emphasising biological explanations in which unawareness is viewed essentially as a symptom, but possible psychosocial factors, together with the socially constructed nature of expressed awareness, are largely neglected. The onset of dementia may be viewed as a threat to self occasioning attempts to regain control through a range of psychological strategies, which are likely to affect the ways in which people communicate an account of their experience and hence the extent to which they may be considered 'aware'. In the present study, 12 participants with a medical diagnosis of early stage Alzheimer's disease, who were described in clinical records as ranging from 'very aware' to 'unaware' of their illness, were interviewed on two occasions. Partners were also interviewed separately on each occasion. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. In response to their memory difficulties, participants were seen as engaging in the processes of acknowledging, reacting, explaining, experiencing the emotional impact, and adjusting. All participants acknowledged memory problems, indicating a basic awareness of changes in their memory functioning, but made varying judgements about the meaning and impact of these. The resulting spectrum of responses formed a continuum running from 'self-maintaining' to 'self-adjusting'. A self-maintaining stance related to attempts to normalise the situation and minimise the difficulties, thus maintaining continuity with prior sense of self, while a self-adjusting stance related to attempts to confront the difficulties and adapt one's sense of self accordingly. A preliminary model of the construction of awareness in early stage Alzheimer's is presented that acknowledges biological mechanisms but places the main emphasis on psychosocial factors and self-concept."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Sub-department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London, Gower Street, WC1E 6BT London, UK. l.clare@ucl.ac.uk"}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Soc Sci Med","NlmUniqueID":"8303205","ISSNLinking":"0277-9536"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Evid Based Nurs. 2004 Jul;7(3):96","PMID":"15252924"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Internal-External Control"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Narration"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Uncertainty"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"7","Day":"25","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"28","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"7","Day":"25","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12878102","S0277953602004768","10.1016\/s0277-9536(02)00476-8"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12382992","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"02","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0894-4105","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Neuropsychology","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuropsychology"},"ArticleTitle":"Relearning face-name associations in early Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"538-47"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions based on errorless learning principles in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) was provided by Clare et al.

While some 'memory training' studies do report an increase in self-report scores on scales assessing these variables, it is not clear whether the changes are attributable to the intervention.

Significant changes observed in intervention studies should be viewed in this context."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Sub-department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London, UK. l.clare@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilson","ForeName":"Barbara A","Initials":"BA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carter","ForeName":"Gina","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Breen","ForeName":"Kristin","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Berrios","ForeName":"German E","Initials":"GE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hodges","ForeName":"John R","Initials":"JR"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Ambulatory Care Facilities"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety Disorders","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Depressive Disorder, Major","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["etiology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"28","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12325058","10.1002\/gps.735"]}}}]}
