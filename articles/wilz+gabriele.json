Studies show evidence for the benefits of individualized music. However, the immediate reactions to individualized music have not yet been adequately investigated.","The research objective of the study was the investigation of the immediate effects of an individualized music intervention in a nursing home using a newly developed systematic behavioral observation rating scale.","In 153 behavioral observations of 20 PwD, 32 different experiences and behaviors pertaining to 11 categories such as emotional and motor changes which indicate immediate reactions to listening to music were rated.","Participants showed significantly more positive reactions (e. g. joy or relaxation) and less negative reactions immediately after listening to the music compared to before. Moreover, in the course of listening to music, participants showed significantly more positive reactions, most often smiles, movements to music, attentive listening, relaxation and general vigilance \/ interest \/ social contact.","The systematic behavioral observation rating scale proved to be a suitable method for rating the experiences and behaviors of people with dementia.

The results of a\u00a0current study suggest that personality traits, sociodemographic and caregiving variables could be associated with poor sleep quality of caregivers of PwD. Nevertheless, the detailed impact of these variables on sleep quality of caregivers is still unknown.","This study is based on secondary data from the Tele.TAnDem project. First, descriptive data of 322 caregivers were analyzed regarding prevalence rates of poor sleep quality and high rates of daytime sleepiness in comparison to non-caregivers. Second, hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to calculate the predictive effect of interpersonal and caregiving related variables on subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.","With respect to the prevalence, descriptive data indicate a poorer subjective sleep quality and higher rates of daytime sleepiness of caregivers of PwD compared to non-caregivers. Regression analyses revealed significant effects for gender, disturbed day-night rhythm, burden of caregiving, stress coping strategies and depressive symptoms regarding subjective sleep quality. The number of disturbed behavior patterns, the burden of caregiving and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher rates of daytime sleepiness.","Caregiving of PwD affects subjective sleep quality as well as daytime sleepiness of caregiving relatives.

care, the role of caregiving sons will also become more important; however, little is known about the caregiving experiences of sons.","Potential differences between caregiving sons and daughters were investigated with respect to the style of caregiving, the feeling of stress and burden and the utilization of support offers.","Baseline survey data from the interventional study Tele.TAnDem conducted from September 2012 to January 2014 were analyzed. From the total sample of 322 caregiving relatives of people suffering from dementia the participating sons (n\u202f=\u200917) were selected. For comparison 17\u00a0participants from the subsample of daughters (n\u202f=\u2009111) were selected by propensity score matching. The analyses were conducted using t\u2011tests, Mann-Whitney tests and \u03c7-tests.","The analyses regarding the style of caregiving, the feeling of stress and burden and the utilization of professional and informal assistance did not reach statistical significance. Daughters scored on average higher than sons only with respect to the acceptance of the caregiving situation (p\u202f<\u20090.05).","Overall caregiving daughters and sons did not differ with respect to caregiving experiences as strongly as previously assumed. Perhaps earlier studies found more gender differences because caregiving sons compared to daughters already have different initial situations, which however remained uncontrolled."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Theurer","ForeName":"Christina","Initials":"C","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1636-8964","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Abteilung

Through qualitative content analysis, this study analyzed intervention strategies applied by therapists in a randomized-controlled trial in Germany to assist caregivers in managing losses and associated emotions. Sequences from 61 therapy sessions that included interventions targeting grief, loss, and change were transcribed and analyzed. A category system was developed deductively, and the intercoder reliability was satisfactory. The identified grief intervention strategies were recognition and acceptance of loss and change,addressing future losses,normalization of grief, and redefinition of the relationship Therapists focused on identifying experienced losses, managing associated feelings, and fostering acceptance of these losses. A variety of cognitive-behavioral therapy-based techniques was applied with each strategy.
