Total self-rated and informant-rated scores on the Functional Activities Questionnaire were split into six ability levels to monitor how poorer functioning impacts the ability to live well. We also investigated the potential influence of sociodemographic and diagnostic variables, depression, cognition, and carer stress.","Multivariate multiple regression models found that people with dementia who had the greatest functional impairment according to self-ratings and informant ratings had poorer living well scores than those with the least functional impairment. Sociodemographic and diagnostic factors and cognition had little impact on effect sizes. For self-ratings, depression attenuated the relationship between functional ability and living well, whereas carer stress attenuated informant ratings.","People with dementia with the least functional impairments had greater capability to live well than those with the most functional impairment. Even subtle perceived difficulties in functional ability had a detrimental effect on the ability of people with dementia to live well. Depression in people with dementia and carer stress in informants influenced these associations, and therefore, these factors should be routinely included in future research studies and clinical assessments."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

is hampered by inconsistent conceptualization and measurement of outcomes and limited evidence about the relative impact of different variables. We aimed to address these issues.","We analyzed data from 1283 caregivers of community-dwelling individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia in the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life cohort study. We generated a \"living well\" latent factor from measures of quality of life, satisfaction with life, and well-being. We used structural equation modelling to derive latent variables for 7 domains reflecting caregivers' perceptions of their personal resources and experiences, and to examine the associations with caregivers' perceptions of their capability to \"live well.\"","The domain of psychological characteristics and psychological health was most strongly related to living well [2.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08-2.97], followed by physical fitness and physical health (1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-1.91) and experiencing caregiving (1.34; 95% CI, 0.99-1.70). Social capitals, assets and resources (0.68; 95% CI, 0.35-1.00) and relationship with the person with dementia (-0.22; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.03) had smaller, significant associations. Social location (0.28; 95% CI, -0.33 to 0.89) and managing everyday life with dementia (0.06; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.28) were not significantly associated with living well.","These findings demonstrate the importance of supporting caregivers' psychological and physical health and their ability to develop and maintain positive coping strategies, as well as enabling them to maintain vital social capitals, assets and resources."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for

aspects of providing care and that this may have a beneficial influence on their well-being. The aim of this systematic review was to explore how positive aspects of caregiving (PAC) affects the well-being of caregivers of people with dementia.","We searched electronic databases for quantitative studies exploring the association between PAC and caregiver well-being. Studies were included if they involved informal (unpaid) caregivers of people with dementia, at least 75% of whom had to be residing in the community. A narrative synthesis was used to explore patterns within the data.","Fifty-three studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Most studies utilized a cross-sectional design. The majority of samples consisted primarily of spouses and female caregivers. Twenty different PAC measures were employed and studies referred to a variety of constructs, such as satisfactions, gains, meaning, and rewards. PAC was associated with lower depressive symptoms and burden. Conversely, PAC was associated with better mental health, quality of life, satisfaction with life, and competence\/self-efficacy. PAC was not associated with self-rated health or personal strain\/stress.","The findings suggest that identifying PAC is associated with better caregiver well-being, although further longitudinal studies are required to explore how this relationship changes over time. Interventions that enable caregivers to gain a more positive experience of caregiving could be beneficial for their well-being."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

a major need for longitudinal research examining the experiences of people with dementia and their primary carers, as relatively little is known about how the factors associated with capability to 'live well' vary over time. The main aim of the IDEAL-2 study is to investigate how and why, over time, people with dementia and their primary carers might vary in their capability to live well with dementia, whilst exploring both their use of health and care services and their unmet needs.","IDEAL-2 will build on the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) cohort of 1547 people (who, at recruitment between July 2014 and July 2016, had mild-to-moderate dementia), and their 1283 primary carers in Great Britain. The existing cohort will be enriched with additional participants with mild-to-moderate dementia (and their primary carers where available and willing) from the following groups: people with rarer forms of dementia, and\/or those who are \u226590\u00a0years or\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years of age at time of recruitment. We will assess the primary outcome, capability to live well with dementia, and the factors influencing it using questionnaires at yearly intervals for 3 years. Additionally, we will seek to link the cohort data with administrative data to obtain information about health service use. Some participants will be invited for in-depth face-to-face interviews. The cohort study will be supplemented by linked research focusing on: the co-production of new measures of living well; including the perspectives of people with advanced dementia living in residential care settings; including people with dementia from black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups; and understanding the experience of people living with undiagnosed dementia.","IDEAL-2 will provide evidence about the key indicators of, and factors associated with, living well over the course of dementia and how these differ for particular subgroups. It will tell us which combinations of services and support are most beneficial and cost-effective. Moreover, the IDEAL-2 study will gather evidence from under-researched groups of people with dementia, who are likely to have their own distinct perceptions of living well."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Silarova","ForeName":"Barbora","Initials":"B","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2473-2527","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health (REACH), College of Medicine and Health, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential impact of deprivation and urban\/rural areas on capability to live well with dementia and to examine whether availability of informal carers modified the associations.","The analysis was based on a large cohort study of 1547 community-dwelling people with dementia across Great Britain. Quality of life, life satisfaction, and well-being were measured as indices of \"living well.\" Multivariate modelling was used to investigate differences in living well measures across deprivation quintiles and urban\/rural areas adjusting for sociodemographic factors and number of comorbidities and stratifying by three groups: those living with a carer, those with a noncoresident carer and those without a carer.","Negative dose-response relationships between deprivation and measures of quality of life (-2.12; 95% CI: -3.52, -0.73), life satisfaction (-1.27; 95% CI: -2.70, 0.16), and well-being (-5.24; 95% CI: -10.11, -0.36) were found in participants living with a carer. The associations were less clear in those with a noncoresident carer and those without a carer but these two groups generally reported lower scores on living well indicators than participants living with a carer.

'living well' with dementia, but there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the factors related to quality of life (QoL), subjective well-being or life satisfaction in people with dementia. We examined the available evidence in a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched electronic databases until 7 January 2016 for observational studies investigating factors associated with QoL, well-being and life satisfaction in people with dementia. Articles had to provide quantitative data and include \u2a7e75% people with dementia of any type or severity. We included 198 QoL studies taken from 272 articles in the meta-analysis. The analysis focused on 43 factors with sufficient data, relating to 37639 people with dementia. Generally, these factors were significantly associated with QoL, but effect sizes were often small (0.1-0.29) or negligible (<0.09). Factors reflecting relationships, social engagement and functional ability were associated with better QoL. Factors indicative of poorer physical and mental health (including depression and other neuropsychiatric symptoms) and poorer carer well-being were associated with poorer QoL. Longitudinal evidence about predictors of QoL was limited. There was a considerable between-study heterogeneity. The pattern of numerous predominantly small associations with QoL suggests a need to reconsider approaches to understanding and assessing living well with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Martyr","ForeName":"Anthony","Initials":"A","Identifier":"0000-0002-1702-8902","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School

Although there are generic measures of illness representations, there is a need for a brief tailored measure to use with people with dementia. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a brief measure called the Representations and Adjustment to Dementia Index (RADIX). The RADIX contains questions on the SRM elements: Identity, Cause, Timeline, Control, and Consequences.","The RADIX validation was conducted with a sample of 385 community-dwelling people with mild to moderate dementia who were taking part in the IDEAL cohort study. Test-retest reliability was conducted over a 4-week period with a separate sample of 20 people with dementia.","The validation process resulted in a reduction in the number of items in the Timeline, Control, and Consequences items. The resulting RADIX demonstrated good acceptability, internal reliability, and test-retest reliability. All the RADIX items had low missing data, indicating good acceptability. The factor analysis confirmed that the Consequences items formed two subscales (practical and emotional consequences) that had Cronbach's \u03b1 of 8 and 0.91 respectively. Test-retest reliability indicated that the Identity, Timeline, and Control items had moderate reliability and the practical and emotional consequences scales had good reliability.","The RADIX demonstrates acceptable psychometric properties, proves to be a useful measure for exploring people's beliefs about dementia, and could aid the provision of tailored information and support to people with dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

We utilise this concept to inform our analysis of 18 qualitative interviews with five people with dementia and four informal carers. Our participants are members of a pre-existing group of dementia advocates, representing the voices of those living with the condition. There are a growing number of people in the early stages of dementia - like our participants - being called upon to account for their experience, as a means of developing a politicised 'collective illness identity'. These interviews present an opportunity to study a group of people who are actively involved in speaking as, and for, people with dementia. Four themes emerged from the data: becoming a voice of or for people with dementia; biographical reinforcement; responsibilisation; and resistance. These themes illustrate the ways in which people with dementia participate in their own identity construction and, as representatives of those living with dementia, they also illustrate the ways in which illness narratives produce material and symbolic value.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

general practitioners (GPs) should engage in direct referrals. The current study investigated current referral practices for neuroimaging in dementia, access to imaging modalities and investigated related GP training in Ireland and North Wales.","A questionnaire was distributed to GPs in the programme regions which included approximately two thirds of all GPs in the Republic of Ireland and all general practitioners in North Wales. A total of 2,093 questionnaires were issued.","48.6% of Irish respondents and 24.3% of Welsh respondents directly referred patients with suspected dementia for neuroimaging. Irish GPs reported greater direct access to neuroimaging than their Welsh counterparts. A very small percentage of Irish and Welsh GPs (4.7% and 10% respectively) had received training in neuroimaging and the majority who referred patients for neuroimaging were not aware of any dementia-specific protocols for referrals (93.1% and 95% respectively).","The benefits of direct GP access to neuroimaging investigations for dementia have yet to be established. Our findings suggest that current GP speciality training in Ireland and Wales is deficient in dementia-specific and neuroimaging training with the concern being that inadequate training will lead to inadequate referrals. Further training would complement guidelines and provide a greater understanding of the role and appropriateness of neuroimaging techniques in the diagnosis of dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ciblis","ForeName":"Aurelia S","Initials":"AS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Butler","ForeName":"Marie-Louise","Initials":"ML","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bokde","ForeName":"Arun L W","Initials":"AL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mullins","ForeName":"Paul G","Initials":"PG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Bangor, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McNulty","ForeName":"Jonathan P","Initials":"JP","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"23"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"PLoS One","NlmUniqueID":"101285081","ISSNLinking":"1932-6203"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnostic imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Ireland"},{"DescriptorName":"Radiography"},{"DescriptorName":"Referral and Consultation"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Wales"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2015","Month":"08","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2016","Month":"02","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"3","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"3","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27007435","10.1371\/journal.pone.0151793","PONE-D-15-32256","PMC4805299"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2007 Jan;22(1):47-54","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17044135"}},{"Citation":"Ont Health Technol Assess Ser. 2014;14(2):1-67","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24592297"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2008 Jul;23(7):663-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18229882"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2014 Jul;29(7):682-93","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24458456"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2010 Sep;25(9):912-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20803720"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimers Dement. 2013 Mar;9(2):208-45","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23507120"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2014 Apr;26(4):605-13","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24382116"}},{"Citation":"Br J Gen Pract. 2010 Sep;60(578):e360-5","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20849686"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2006 Apr;21(4):319-24","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16534765"}},{"Citation":"Ir J Med Sci. 2016 Aug;185(3):597-602","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"26048643"}},{"Citation":"Lancet Neurol. 2002 May;1(1):13-21","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12849541"}},{"Citation":"Fam Pract. 2011 Jun;28(3):272-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21115987"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26836172","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"51","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2016"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"\"I Don't Think Of It As An Illness\": Illness Representations in Mild to Moderate Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"139-50"},"ELocationID":"10.3233\/JAD-150794","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The self-regulatory model proposes that illness representations influence adjustment and coping in chronic conditions. Better understanding of the illness representations held by people with dementia could help with targeting information and support so as to optimize adjustment and coping. In this mixed-methods study of illness representations among people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's, vascular, or mixed dementia we aimed to clarify the nature of the representations held, to determine whether specific profiles can be identified based on perceptions of the identity and cause of the condition, and to examine associations between these profiles and other participant characteristics. Data were collected in the second wave of the Memory Impairment and Dementia Awareness Study (MIDAS). Sixty-four people with dementia, who had been told their diagnosis at a memory clinic, completed interviews and responded to questionnaires. In each case a carer was also interviewed. Cluster analysis based on responses about identity and cause identified three profiles. 'Illness' cluster participants saw themselves as living with an illness and used diagnostic labels, 'ageing' cluster participants did not use diagnostic labels and viewed their difficulties as related to ageing, and 'no problem' cluster participants considered that they did not have any difficulties. 'Illness' cluster participants had better cognition and better awareness, but lower mood, and perceived more practical consequences, than 'ageing' cluster participants. Holding an 'illness' model may not be advantageous. Rather than encouraging adoption of such a model, it may be preferable to target information and select interventions in line with the person's representation profile.

condition is a key United Kingdom policy objective. The aim of this project is to identify what helps people to live well or makes it difficult to live well in the context of having dementia or caring for a person with dementia, and to understand what 'living well' means from the perspective of people with dementia and carers.","Over a two-year period, 1500 people with early-stage dementia throughout Great Britain will be recruited to the study, together with a carer wherever possible. All the participants will be visited at home initially and again 12 months and 24 months later. This will provide information about the way in which well-being, life satisfaction and quality of life are affected by social capitals, assets and resources, the challenges posed by dementia, and the ways in which people adjust to and cope with these challenges. A smaller group will be interviewed in more depth.","The findings will lead to recommendations about what can be done by individuals, communities, health and social care practitioners, care providers

management of response conflict suggests that being bilingual might contribute to increased cognitive reserve. In support of this, recent evidence indicates that bilinguals develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) later than monolinguals, and may retain an advantage in performance on executive control tasks. We compared age at the time of receiving an AD diagnosis in bilingual Welsh\/English speakers (n\u00a0=\u00a037) and monolingual English speakers (n\u00a0=\u00a049), and assessed the performance of bilinguals (n\u00a0=\u00a024) and monolinguals (n\u00a0=\u00a049) on a range of executive control tasks. There was a non-significant difference in age at the time of diagnosis, with bilinguals being on average 3\u00a0years older than monolinguals, but bilinguals were also significantly more cognitively impaired at the time of diagnosis. There were no significant differences between monolinguals and bilinguals in performance on executive function tests, but bilinguals appeared to show relative strengths in the domain of inhibition and response conflict. Bilingual Welsh\/English speakers with AD do not show a clear advantage in executive function over monolingual English speakers, but may retain some benefits in inhibition and management of response conflict. There may be a delay in onset of AD in Welsh\/English bilinguals, but if so, it is smaller than that found in some other clinical populations. In this Welsh sample, bilinguals with AD came to the attention of services later than monolinguals, and reasons for this pattern could be explored further.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2014 The

health conditions. However, there has been limited exploration of how applicable such an approach is in early stage dementia. In this study we explored the views of people with dementia and family caregivers on the use of self-management in dementia. We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 people with early stage dementia and 11 caregivers. We analyzed transcripts using thematic analysis. We found eight themes in the analysis, and they indicated that self-management occurs in the context of peoples' family and social relationships as well as relationships with professional services. Six of the themes involved barriers to and facilitators of self-management. It is evident from these findings that people with dementia and caregivers use self-management techniques. Their use of such techniques could be enhanced by the development of interventions designed to help people with dementia to develop their self-management skills.

Growing numbers of people with early-stage dementia are contributing accounts that emphasise the benefits of actively engaging in managing the condition. Self-management interventions share the common objectives of educating about the condition, optimising well-being, enhancing control over the situation and enabling people to take more responsibility for managing the condition. Benefits of such an approach can include improved knowledge, self-efficacy, health status, and better performance of self-management behaviours. However, there is only preliminary evidence that people with early-stage dementia can benefit from such interventions.","This feasibility study involves the development of a self-management group intervention for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. This study is a single-site pilot randomised-controlled trial. Forty-two people with early stage dementia, each with a caregiver (family member\/friend), will be randomised to either the self-management group intervention or to treatment as usual.The self-management group intervention will involve eight weekly sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, held at a memory clinic in North Wales. All participants will be re-assessed three and six months post-randomisation. This study is intended to supply an early evaluation of the self-management intervention so that a full scale trial may be powered from the best available evidence. It will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the study design and the recruitment strategies. It will estimate the parameters and confidence intervals for the research questions of interest. The primary outcome of interest is the self-efficacy score of the person with dementia at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for the person with dementia are self-efficacy at six months post-randomisation and cognitive ability, mood and well-being at three and six months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for caregivers are their distress and stress at three and six months post-randomisation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be examined.","This study will provide preliminary information about the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a self-management group

We interviewed 12 family caregivers of relatives with dementia. We analysed transcripts of these interviews using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Six key themes emerged from the analysis, which were encompassed under an overarching theme of 'balancing needs'. This describes the caregivers' constant struggle to balance their own needs against those of their relative, which created a series of dilemmas. These dilemmas emerged from the desire to try to preserve the caregivers' relationship with their relative, while recognising that this relationship was changing. The caregivers' relationship with their relative influenced the caregivers' motivations to provide care and gave caregiving meaning. Although caregivers were motivated to provide care the battle to balance needs meant that the caregivers recognised there might come a time when they may need to cease caregiving.

We developed an observational tool, AwareCare, which care staff can use to identify signs of awareness in residents with very severe dementia, based on the concept of the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM). Using WHIM items as a guide, and following focus groups with care staff and family members, an expert panel identified 28 environmental stimuli and 35 response categories for the initial version of AwareCare. After baseline assessments of cognition, well-being and quality of life were taken, 40 residents were observed individually for 30 minutes on 5 occasions. Based on the observational data, 10 stimulus categories and 14 response categories were identified for further analysis and formed the final version of AwareCare. All participants showed awareness to varying degrees. Social stimuli elicited the most responses. Greater awareness was associated with better cognitive function, self-care, mobility, and responsiveness, but not with proxy-rated quality of life.

Limited understanding of dementia appeared to add considerably to the difficulties faced by caregivers at a time when they were having to respond to major changes in their relationship and interactions, make significant adjustments in their lives and consider the future.","This study underlines the importance of helping family members to develop a working understanding of the condition in the early stages."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bangor University, School of Psychology, Gwynedd, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pearce","ForeName":"Alison","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Dijkhuizen","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Comprehension"},{"DescriptorName":"Data Interpretation, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Life Change Events"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Spouses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"1","Day":"1","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19023728","905762087","10.1080\/13607860802380623"]}}}]}
