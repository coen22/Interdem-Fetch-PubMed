Nurses and nursing assistants in 15 Flemish nursing homes (Belgium) completed the Palliative care Outcome Scale for 109 residents with palliative care needs.","Pain, as well as other physical symptoms, was present in more than half of the nursing home residents according to caregivers. The most prominent needs occurred on psychosocial and spiritual domains, such as patient anxiety, support, finding life worth living and self-worth. Caregivers reported that residents with dementia experienced fewer physical symptoms apart from pain than did residents without dementia (coeffficient -0.73, 95% CI -1.18-0.84; P\u2009=\u20090.001. Furthermore, residents with dementia received higher scores on the items \"support\" (coefficient 0.75; 95% CI 0.15-1.34, P\u2009=\u20090.015), \"life worthwhile\" (coeffficient 0.58; 95% CI 0.090-1.07, P\u2009=\u20090.020) and \"self-worth\" (coefficient 0.58, 95% CI 0.13-1.03, P\u2009=\u20090.012).","According to caregivers, residents with dementia experienced fewer other physical symptoms (e.g. nausea) than residents without dementia. This, however, might be a result of an underdetection of other symptoms in nursing home residents with dementia. Furthermore, most challenges in nursing homes lie within the spiritual and psychosocial domains of palliative care, particularly in people with dementia. These aspects should be integrated in the professional education of caregivers. Assessment tools might be of help to improve the identification of needs and symptoms.

Besides clarifying the quality of the caregiving relationship in two populations of chronically ill patients, this investigation examines whether patient characteristics, carer characteristics and network characteristics are predictive of relationship quality in dementia caregiving. Partners, children or children-in-law caring for a relative suffering from dementia (N = 144) and partners or parents of persons suffering from chronic mental illness (N = 77) were interviewed with a semi-structured questionnaire. The measurement of relationship quality is based on the literature of Expressed Emotion and covers two dimensions: the level of criticism and the level of warmth. In general, the relationship between a carer and his or her chronically ill relative was marked by a low level of conflict or criticism and a high degree of warmth. The main predictors of a poorer relationship quality were disturbances in the patient's behaviour and the carer's perception of these disturbances. Our results suggest that, rather than limiting investigations to the burden experienced by the family carer, future research and interventions on chronically ill patients should focus on the quality of the carer-patient relationship and its determinants."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spruytte","ForeName":"Nele","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"LUCAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. nele.spruytte@med.kuleuven.ac.be"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van Audenhove","ForeName":"Chantal","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lammertyn","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Storms","ForeName":"Gerrit","Initials":"G"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Psychol Psychother","NlmUniqueID":"101135751","ISSNLinking":"1476-0835"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Chronic Disease"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"10","Day":"25","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"28","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"10","Day":"25","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12396755","10.1348\/147608302320365208"]}}}]}
