Moreover, staff may find difficulty in translating what they have learned during training into practice. This paper report the development and evaluation of a set of workshops using an appreciative inquiry approach to implement person-centred dementia care in two hospital wards. Staff worked collaboratively to develop a ward vision and to implement a number of action plans. Using appreciative inquiry approach, staff attitudes towards persons with dementia improved, inter-professional collaboration was enhanced and small changes in staff practices were noted. Dementia care in hospitals can be enhanced by empowering staff to take small but concrete actions after they engage in appreciative inquiry workshops, during which they are listened to and appreciated for what they can contribute."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scerri","ForeName":"Anthony","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Malta, Malta."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Stirling, UK; Salford Institute for Dementia, University of Salford, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scerri","ForeName":"Charles","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta, Malta."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"06"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitals","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Patient Relations"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["appreciative inquiry","dementia","evaluation","hospital wards","person-centred care","staff empowerment"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27758956","1471301216663953","10.1177\/1471301216663953"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27662075","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"03","Day":"15"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1364-6915","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"08"}},"Title":"Aging & mental health","ISOAbbreviation":"Aging Ment Health"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia training programmes for staff working in general hospital settings - a systematic review of the literature.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"783-796"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/13607863.2016.1231170","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Although literature describing and evaluating training programmes in hospital settings increased in recent years, there are no reviews that summarise these programmes.
