This project evaluates a model of care that integrates evidence-based strategies into a person-centred interdisciplinary rehabilitation package: Interdisciplinary Home-bAsed Reablement Program (I-HARP). Two central aims are: 1) to determine the effectiveness of I-HARP on functional independence, mobility, quality of life and depression among people with dementia, their home environmental safety, carer burden and quality of life, and I-HARP cost-effectiveness; and 2) to evaluate the processes, outcomes and influencing factors of the I-HARP implementation.","I-HARP is a 4-month model of care, integrated in community aged care services and hospital-based community geriatric services, and consists of: 1) 8-12 home visits, tailored to the individual client's needs, by an occupational therapist, registered nurse, and other allied health staff; 2) minor home modifications\/assistive devices to the value of <A$1000 per participant; and 3) three individual carer support sessions. The overarching design is a mixed-methods action research approach, consisting of a multi-centre pragmatic parallel-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) and realist evaluation, conducted in two phases. Participants include 176 dyads (person aged >\u200960\u2009years with mild to moderate dementia and his\/her carer). During Phase I, I-HARP advisory group is established and training of I-HARP interventionists is completed, and the effectiveness of I-HARP is examined using a pragmatic RCT. Phase II, conducted concurrently with Phase I, focuses on the process evaluation of the I-HARP implementation using a realist approach. Semi-structured interviews with participants and focus groups with I-HARP interventionists and participating site managers will provide insights into the contexts, mechanisms and outcomes of I-HARP.","I-HARP is being evaluated within the real-world systems of hospital-based and community-based aged care services in Australia. Future directions and strategies for reablement approaches to care for community dwelling people living with dementia, will be developed. The study will provide evidence to inform key stakeholders in their decision making and the use\/delivery of the program, as well as influence future systems-thinking and changes for dementia care.","Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTR N12618000600246 (approved

Main limitations of the 18 tools reviewed concern a lack of standardization, normative data, and criterion validity, as well as poor evidence of reliability of tools originally developed for non-neurodegenerative LCI (e.g., aphasia in the context of cerebrovascular accidents). Furthermore, no tool considers the perspectives of people with dementia regarding the impact of LCI on their daily lives.","Further research is needed to improve reliability and validity of currently available tools for the linguistic assessment of people living with dementia.

The introduction of social health has followed the zeitgeist of campaigners for a better life for those living with dementia, with initiatives to improve the social images of dementia (Alzheimers.org, 2017). Examples from social research in dementia to examine friendships and the social environments of people with dementia exist (Medeiros et al., 2012), but introduction of the paradigm of social health in dementia (Vernooij-Dassen and Jeon, 2016) has harnessed a growing research agenda (de Vugt and Dr\u00f6es, 2017). This paradigm provides an umbrella concept to study how social aspects influence the dynamic balance between opportunities and limitations in dementia. Social health goes beyond the neuropathology of dementia, to understand how people, their social networks and wider society with its norms, interact with the condition (Vernooij-Dassen and Jeon, 2016). It is not far removed from the ideas of Tom Kitwood, the pioneer of person-centered dementia care, who noted that \"personhood is a standing or status that is bestowed upon one human being, by others, in the context of relationship and social being\" (Kitwood, 1997). The INTERDEM (Early detection and timely INTERvention in DEMentia, www.interdem.org) psychosocial research agenda aspired to improve knowledge about social inclusion and reciprocal relationships for people with dementia (Moniz-Cook et al., 2011).

However, these programs (such as the Care of People with dementia in their Environments (COPE) program) are not widely available. The primary aim of this study is to determine the strategies and processes that enable the COPE program to be implemented into existing dementia care services in Australia.","This study uses a mixed methods approach to test an implementation strategy. The COPE intervention (up to ten consultations with an occupational therapist and up to two consultations with a nurse) will be implemented using a number of strategies including planning (such as developing and building relationships with dementia care community service providers), educating (training nurses and occupational therapists in how to apply the intervention), restructuring (organisations establishing referral systems; therapist commitment to provide COPE to five clients following training) and quality management (coaching, support, reminders and fidelity checks). Qualitative and quantitative data will contribute to understanding how COPE is adopted and implemented. Feasibility, fidelity, acceptability, uptake and service delivery contexts will be explored and a cost\/benefit evaluation conducted. Client outcomes of activity engagement and caregiver wellbeing will be assessed in a pragmatic pre-post evaluation.","While interventions that promote independence and wellbeing are effective and highly valued by people with dementia and their carers, access to such programs is limited. Barriers to translation that have been previously identified are addressed in this study, including limited training opportunities and a lack of confidence in clinicians working with complex symptoms of dementia. A strength of the study is that it involves implementation within different types of existing services, such as government and private providers, so the study will provide useful guidance for further

management of behavioural and psychological disturbances, yet they are commonly used in nursing homes. Organisational culture is an important consideration influencing use of psychotropic medicines. Schein's theory elucidates that organisational culture is underpinned by basic assumptions, which are the taken for granted beliefs driving organisational members' behaviour and practices. By exploring the basic assumptions of culture we are able to find explanations for why psychotropic medicines are prescribed contrary to standards. A qualitative study guided by Schein's theory was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 40 staff representing a broad range of roles from eight nursing homes. Findings from the study suggest two basic assumptions influenced the use of psychotropic medicines: locus of control and necessity for efficiency or comprehensiveness. Locus of control pertained to whether staff believed they could control decisions when facing negative work experiences. Necessity for efficiency or comprehensiveness concerned how much time and effort was spent on a given task. Participants' arrived at decisions to use psychotropic medicines that were inconsistent with ideal standards when they believed they were helpless to do the right thing by the resident and it was necessary to restrict time on a given task. Basic assumptions tended to provide the rationale for staff to use psychotropic medicines when it was not compatible with standards. Organisational culture is an important factor that should be addressed to optimise psychotropic medicine use.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods A retrospective analysis of national audit data collected from 426 facilities between 2015 and 2016 was performed. Regression models were used to examine associations between five clinical indicators (falls, pressure injury, physical restraint, unplanned weight loss and polypharmacy) and level of care needs measured by the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) and consumer and care staff survey responses. Results With the exception of polypharmacy, commonly collected negative clinical outcomes were rare events. Compared with care homes with <25% of residents having high-level care needs (high ACFI), homes with 25<75% high-ACFI residents had more occurrences of all negative clinical outcomes except pressure injury. Homes with \u226575% high-ACFI residents reported the highest rates of polypharmacy (odds ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.39 - 1.57). Falls, unplanned weight loss and pressure injury were inversely associated with satisfaction scores adjusted for residents' level of care needs. Conclusions This first Australian study of multistate clinical indicator data suggests interpretation of clinical indicators of aged-care home quality requires consideration of the level of residents' care needs. What is known about the topic? Many Australian aged-care providers use quality indicators (QI) through benchmarking companies or in-house programs. The five most widely used aged-care clinical QIs in Australia are falls, pressure injury, physical restraint, unplanned weight loss and polypharmacy. Prevalence and incidence of these QIs are highly variable among Australian studies. A consistent message in the international literature is that residents' clinical characteristics influence QI outcomes at baseline and may continue to influence outcomes over time. Study of associations between Australian aged-care home characteristics and QI outcomes has been limited. What does this paper add? This is the first Australian study of multistate clinical QI data. It is also the first to consider the level of resident care needs in the interpretation of clinical QI outcomes and exploration of the association between level of consumer and staff satisfaction and QI outcomes. What are the implications for practitioners? Understanding the connections between aged-care home characteristics, consumer and staff perceptions and clinical QIs is crucial in the meaningful interpretation of QI outcomes in context. With the recent introduction of the National Aged Care Quality Indicator Program, it is timely to review national policy, to gauge current quality of care and the measure of care quality in the sector, and to develop directions for possible research to inform and resolve debates regarding the potential influence and unplanned effects that such a program may have."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jeon","ForeName":"Yun-Hee","Initials":"YH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, Level 5, 88 Mallett Street, Camperdown, NSW, 2050, Australia.

Purposive sampling achieved maximum variation in dementia experience and participant characteristics. Focus groups with Scouts in the community aged 9-12 years old (n = 22) used innovative techniques to explore children's attitudes towards people with dementia. Participants with personal experience of dementia were five people with early-stage dementia; 12 adult primary carers; four non-primary carers; and six grandchildren of a person with dementia. They were asked what is important for children to understand about dementia and what attitudes they may like an education program to confer. Content analysis was performed using NVivo10.","Strong themes to emerge were that children need to know the whole truth about dementia; that individuals with dementia are \"still people,\" that it is \"not the fault\" of the person with dementia; and that dementia is different and typically unpredictable for everyone.

However, there is a major knowledge gap in providing reablement for people living with dementia.

first multi-country research project to determine whether or not European quality indicators (QIs) for psychosocial care in dementia could be implemented as a valid tool in residential aged care across seven Asia-Pacific sites (Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand).","Following the European QI protocol, auditing and data extraction of medical records of consenting residents with dementia were conducted by trained auditors with relevant health care backgrounds. Detailed field notes by the auditors were also obtained to describe the characteristics of the participating care facilities, as well as key issues and challenges encountered, for each of the 12 QIs.","Sixteen residential care facilities in the seven Asia-Pacific sites participated in this study. Data from 275 residents' records revealed each of the 12 Qis' endorsement varied widely within and between the study sites (0%-100%). Quality of the medical records, family and cultural differences, definitions and scoring of certain indicators, and time-consuming nature of the QI administration were main concerns for implementation.","Several items in the European QIs in the current format were deemed problematic when used to measure the quality of psychosocial care in the residential aged care settings in participating Asia-Pacific countries. We propose refinements of the European QIs for the Asian-Pacific context, taking into account multiple factors identified in this study. Our findings provide crucial insights for future research and implementation of psychosocial dementia care QIs in this region."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jeon","ForeName":"Yun-Hee","Initials":"YH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Sydney

awareness about dementia. There is some qualitative work with children with a relative with dementia, but little work into the insights of children as general citizens without affected family. One issue is an absence of measurement tools; thus the study aimed to design and pilot a psychometrically sound self-report measure of dementia attitudes for children.","Using a multi-staged scale development process, stakeholder and expert input informed a 52-item Kids Insight into Dementia Survey (KIDS). After a pretest of KIDS with 21 Australian schoolchildren aged 10-12 years, exploratory factor analysis and reliability and validity testing were run on a revised KIDS with data from 203 similar-aged schoolchildren.","The KIDS was reduced from 52 to 14 items, and a three-factor solution identified: 'Personhood,' 'Stigma,' and 'Dementia Understanding.' A strong positive correlation with an adult measure of dementia attitudes (r = .76) and a moderate positive correlation with a child measure of attitudes towards older adults (r = .47) indicated good concurrent validity. Internal consistency of .83 indicated good reliability.","Results support the use of KIDS as a tool to measure children's insight into dementia, and to evaluate dementia education initiatives targeting the youth."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baker","ForeName":"Jess R","Initials":"JR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Psychiatry Research and Teaching Unit, Liverpool Hospital , University of New South Wales , Liverpool , Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Low","ForeName":"Lee-Fay","Initials":"LF","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Ageing, Work & Health Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences , University of Sydney , Camperdown , Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodenough","ForeName":"Belinda","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c Dementia Training Australia , University of Wollongong , Wollongong , Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jeon","ForeName":"Yun-Hee","Initials":"YH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"d Sydney Nursing School , University of Sydney , Camperdown , Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tsang","ForeName":"Ruby S M","Initials":"RSM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"e Dementia Collaborative Research Centre\u00a0-\u00a0Assessment and Better Care , School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales , Sydney , Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bryden","ForeName":"Christine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Psychiatry Research and Teaching Unit, Liverpool Hospital , University of New South Wales , Liverpool , Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hutchinson","ForeName":"Karen","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"f Sydney Medical School, Hornsby Kur-Ring-Gai Hospital , University of Sydney , Hornsby , Australia."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"05","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Child"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Factor Analysis, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":["instrumentation","methods","standards"]}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","attitudes","children","exploratory factor analysis","measure development"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"5","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"5","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28481643","10.1080\/13607863.2017.1320703"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27538349","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"01","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1545-7214","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11"}},"Title":"The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Development and Validation of a Short Version of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia for Screening Residents in Nursing Homes.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1007-1016"},"ELocationID":["S1064-7481(16)30128-2","10.1016\/j.jagp.2016.05.012"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To develop and validate a short version of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD-19) for routine detection of depression in nursing homes.","Australian nursing homes.","A series of cross-sectional studies were conducted involving: 1) descriptive analysis of pooled data from five nursing home studies that used the CSDD-19 (N\u2009=\u2009671) to identify patterns of responses and missing data on individual CSDD items; 2) analysis of four of the five studies (N\u2009=\u2009556) to assess CSDD-19 for unidimensionality, item fit, and differential item functioning using Rasch modeling to develop a shorter version, the CSDD-4; 3) validation of the CSDD-4 against the DSM-IV using the fifth study of 115 residents and through expert consultations; and 4) evaluation of the clinical utility of CSDD-4 using an independent cohort of 92 nursing home residents.","Four items from the original CSDD-19 were found to be most suitable for depression screening: anxiety, sadness, lack of reactivity to pleasant events, and irritability. The CSDD-4 highly correlated with the original scale (N\u2009=\u2009474, r\u2009=\u20090.831, p\u2009<\u20090.001), with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha\u2009=\u20090.70). At the cutoff score of less than 2, sensitivity and specificity of CSDD-4 were 81% and 51%, respectively, for the independent cohort (N\u2009=\u200992), of whom 50% had dementia. The CSDD-4 had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 (z\u2009=\u20093.47, p\u2009<\u20090.001), which was compatible with the CSDD-19 (AUC\u2009=\u20090.69, z\u2009=\u20092.89, p\u2009<\u20090.01).","The CSDD-4 is valid for routine screening of depression in nursing homes. Its adoption is feasible and practical for nursing home staff, and may facilitate more comprehensive assessment and management of depression in nursing home residents."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

The study aimed to help dementia carers develop self-efficacy, be less hassled by the caring role and improve their health and well-being with goal-directed behaviour, by participating in an eight module carer coaching program.","The study used mixed methods in a pre\/post-test\/follow-up design over 24\u00a0months, with assignment of consented dementia carers to either individualised (n\u2009=\u200916) or group coaching (n\u2009=\u200932), or usual carer support services (n\u2009=\u200943), depending on preference. Care-giving self-efficacy and hassles, carer health, well-being and goal-directed behaviours were assessed over time. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare changes over time and the effects of coaching on carer self-efficacy, hassles and health, using the Univariate General Linear Model (GLM).","All carers were hassled by many aspects of caring at baseline. Participants receiving coaching reported non-significant improvements in most areas of self-efficacy for caring, hassles associated with caring and self-reported health at post-test and follow-up, than did carers receiving usual carer support. Group coaching had greater success in helping carers to achieve their goals and to seek help from informal and formal support networks and services.","The study outcomes were generally positive, but need to be interpreted cautiously, given some methodological limitations. It has been shown, however, that health staff can assist dementia carers to develop self-efficacy in better managing their family member's limitations and behaviour, seek help from others and attend to their health.

moods in nursing home residents with dementia may be a response to a lack of personalized, meaningful activity and stimulation. To address this deficiency, a personal computer was adapted to play favorite music and display photographs, movies and messages that were selected or made by family members. The system (called Memory Box) is accompanied by a simplified interface to help people with dementia access material independently. The system's ability to reduce agitation, and improve symptoms of depression and anxiety, was tested by means of an eight-week randomized, single-blinded, cross-over trial comparing Memory Box with a control condition that offered equivalent contact with research staff. Eleven nursing home residents with mild to severe dementia and persistent, daily agitated behaviors completed the study. Outcome measures included ratings of anxiety, depression and agitated behavior made by knowledgeable staff members in collaboration with researchers. Memory Box was well utilized and highly rated by residents, families and staff members. There were significant reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms during the course of the intervention. The system shows promise as a tool to assist families and nursing home staff to improve the wellbeing of cognitively impaired older people with agitated behaviors.

It is difficult for nurses and general practitioners in aged care facilities to cease new residents' psychotropic medications when they often have no information about why residents were started on the treatment, when and by whom and with what result. Most existing interventions have had a limited and temporary effect and there is a need to test different strategies to overcome the structural and practical barriers to psychotropic medication cessation or deprescribing. In this chapter, we review the literature regarding psychotropic medication deprescribing in aged care facilities and present the protocol of a novel study that will examine the potential role of family members in facilitating deprescribing. This project will help determine if family members can contribute information that will prove useful to clinicians and thereby overcome one of the barriers to deprescribing medications whose harmful effects often outweigh their benefits. We wish to understand the knowledge and attitudes of family members regarding the prescribing and deprescribing of psychotropic medications to newly admitted residents of aged care facilities with a view to developing and testing a range of clinical interventions that will result in better, safer prescribing practices.

While DCM is employed as an outcome measure of well-being and as a process to assist staff improve quality of care, it has not been subject to the rigorous scrutiny of a controlled trial to establish its efficacy as an outcome measure, or as an intervention. In 2005 the authors were awarded an Australian Health Minister's Grant to conduct a randomised control trial of DCM in 15 residential dementia care units across the city of Sydney, Australia. This paper reports on a pilot study conducted with 35 dementia care residents in three secure residential care units in the state of New South Wales, Australia, prior to the controlled trial. The main aims of the pilot were to determine the sensitivity of DCM against the validated baseline and outcome measures selected for the trial and to evaluate the utility of the research plan. The utility of the research plan was established. Whilst a significant improvement was shown in staff interactions with residents over time, there was no evidence that DCM improved the residents' quality of life and well-being in relation to physical and cognitive functioning, although there was a reduction in the residents' levels of agitation and depression. While as a research tool DCM needs further refinement to match the strength of validated outcome measures that more accurately assess the residents' well-being, DCM procedures improved staff's attention to monitoring and attending to the residents' well-being."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chenoweth","ForeName":"Lynn","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Technology Sydney, Australia. lynn.chenoweth@sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jeon","ForeName":"Yun-Hee","Initials":"YH"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"New South Wales"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"6","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"6","Day":"15","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17558574","779269263","10.1080\/13607860600844226"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15660554","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"06","Day":"06"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0309-2402","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"49","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"Journal of advanced nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"J Adv Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Respite care for caregivers and people with severe mental illness: literature review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"297-306"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The aim of this study was to review research literature over the past 10 years on respite care for people affected by severe mental illness; and identify key implications for nursing practice in provision of respite care for family caregivers of people with severe mental illness.","Family caregivers play an important role in health care, but need regular breaks to maintain their own health and well-being. Respite care is one of the few services available with a primary focus on supporting family caregivers. In most developed countries the notion of respite care as an extension of the health care service has been embraced, evidenced by a growing body of literature in health and health-related disciplines.","An initial literature search was undertaken using the key words \"respite\", \"short-term care\", \"shared care\" and \"day care\" in major electronic databases for nursing, psychiatry, psychology and sociology literature between 1967 and 2002, identifying 704 articles. Closer examination of the literature from 1993 to 2002 on gaps and trends in respite care for people affected by severe mental illness was conducted. This is discussed in the context of the broader literature, particularly on dementia, where the mainstream research on respite care is found.","The majority of family caregiving studies identified a need for greater quality, quantity, variety and flexibility in respite provision, and the literature has remained largely silent in relation to those affected by severe mental illness. There are contradictory findings on outcomes of respite care services and a lack of controlled empirical studies and evaluative research on effectiveness.","Respite care is beneficial for caregivers, there is significant unmet need in provision of services for the mentally ill, and greater flexibility and the needs of caregivers should be recognised and addressed."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jeon","ForeName":"Yun-Hee","Initials":"YH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Nursing Research Officer, Health and Ageing Research Unit, South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. jeony@sesahs.nsw.gov.au"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brodaty","ForeName":"Henry","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chesterson","ForeName":"Jon","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Adv Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"7609811","ISSNLinking":"0309-2402"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Nursing Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Nursing","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Respite Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"64"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"1","Day":"22","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"7","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"1","Day":"22","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15660554","JAN3287","10.1111\/j.1365-2648.2004.03287.x"]}}}]}
