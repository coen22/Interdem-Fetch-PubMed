However, even in the face of considerable caregiving demands and burden, some carers are resistant to stress, which may be a sign of resilience. This study investigated whether the clinical symptoms of the person with YOAD might be associated with resilience in their carers. A consecutive series of 43 persons with YOAD and their 43 family caregivers were assessed. The carers showed moderate to high level of resilience, low level of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and moderate level of burden. No relationship was found between resilience and sociodemographic characteristics of both carers and care recipient and with clinical characteristics of persons with YOAD. A linear regression analysis showed that resilience was inversely associated with carers' depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that resilience may mainly be related to carers' mental health."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kimura","ForeName":"Nath\u00e1lia R

represents a radical break from an age-normative and expected life course. The disease afflicts the person's identity, threatens the self-image and self-confidence, and erodes the person's plans. The aim of the study was toexamine how people living alone with YOD perceive the course of dementia, their needs, and coping strategies, with a focus on narrating everyday life experiences. A longitudinal study using a qualitative approach was used. Five interviews, each with 10 informants, took place every 6 months from 2014 to 2017. The main theme is the person's experiences of changes of identity over time. The most significant aspects of their experiences of the dementia affecting them and their reactions are these: the initial signs, coping efforts, concealing the diagnosis, social retraction, existential anxiety, revival of the self, worse and worse, and health personnel as background. The study concluded thatpeople with dementia are able to describe their experiences and needs for a long time during the progression of dementia. Their voices should be listened to for planning of services. Personalized care should be used to support them in order to preserve their identity in a normalized everyday life as far as possible."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Johannessen","ForeName":"Aud","Initials":"A","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7686-7263","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health , Vestfold Hospital Trust , T\u00f8nsberg , Norway."},{"Affiliation":"b University of South-Eastern , Vestfold , Norway."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Engedal","ForeName":"Knut","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health , Vestfold Hospital Trust , T\u00f8nsberg , Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Haugen","ForeName":"Per Kristian","Initials":"PK","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health , Vestfold Hospital Trust , T\u00f8nsberg , Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dourado","ForeName":"Marcia Cristina Nascimento","Initials":"MCN","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c Center for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, Institute of Psychiatry , Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thorsen","ForeName":"Kirsten","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health , Vestfold Hospital Trust , T\u00f8nsberg , Norway."},{"Affiliation":"d Oslo Metropolitan University , Oslo , Norway."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Int J Qual Stud Health Well-being","NlmUniqueID":"101256506","ISSNLinking":"1748-2623"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Age of Onset"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Existentialism"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Independent Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Narration"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Isolation"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Coping","existential needs","health care","health promotion","longitudinal qualitative study","subjective experiences","young people"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29975182","10.1080\/17482631.2018.1490620","PMC6041786"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2008;26(2):147-52","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18679029"}},{"Citation":"J Gen Intern Med. 2006 Jan;21 Suppl 1:S40-4","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16405709"}},{"Citation":"J Clin Exp Neuropsychol. 2010 Apr;32(4):408-16","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19787523"}},{"Citation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2012;34(5-6):319-27","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"23208452"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 1989 Apr;29(2):183-90","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"2519525"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 1998 May;13(5):323-30","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9658265"}},{"Citation":"Clin Psychol Rev. 2010 Feb;30(1):113-26","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19896760"}},{"Citation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2004 May-Jun;12(3):272-80","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15126228"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2006 Dec;56(5):472-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17078823"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2002 Apr;38(1):94-104","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11895535"}},{"Citation":"Nurs Philos. 2011 Oct;12(4):282-92;

four persons with young-onset dementia (YOD) (<65 years old) has children younger than 18 years old at the onset of the dementia. These children experience a childhood different from what is expected. Adult children of parents with YOD are seldom addressed in research, and the impact of the dementia on the children's development over time has rarely been studied.","The goal of this study was to explore how adult children experienced the influence of their parents' dementia on their own development during adolescence; what coping efforts, strategies, and resources they employed; and how they evaluated the most recent changes in their life situation.","A follow-up, grounded theory approach in two phases was used. Qualitative interviews with 14 informants (18-30 years of age) were conducted in 2014 and one year later, in 2015.","Nearly all the informants expressed that their emotional well-being and their life situation were better at the second interview compared to the time of dementia onset in their parents. To overcome the difficulties of being a child of a parent with YOD, they used different instrumental, cognitive, and emotional coping strategies, subsumed analytically under the concept detachment. This category covers three subcategories of coping strategies: moving apart, greater personal distance, and calmer emotional reactions. Another category, resilience, designates combinations of the coping strategies. Vital for the development of coping resources and resilience was the need the informants had for social support-for people they saw who listened to them and responded to their needs.","Most of the informants reported that they experienced a better life situation and less emotional stress over time as their parent's dementia progressed. They developed better coping capacities and greater resilience. Vital for the development of coping resources and resilience was the need the informants had for social

interpret metaphorical expressions of the lived experiences of everyday life in people with young-onset dementia (YOD) and to compare these findings with findings from an analysis via grounded theory to see if the second analysis adds more knowledge to the topic. In this secondary analysis of data, metaphors from 20 Norwegian men and women living with YOD were investigated. Using Steger's anthropological three-step method, three categories were identified: Sliding away, leaving traces, and all alone in the world. Comprehensively, we understood the metaphors as representing the participants' shifting sense of being. The main findings of the study show that by analysing the data by combining and using both methods, more knowledge to the topic was added. Acknowledging metaphorical expressions as a source of knowledge, this study reflects on how metaphors can be used in therapeutic dialogue. We conclude that metaphors add to the understanding of descriptions of daily life in a more existential way, beyond the results gained from the grounded theory analysis. However, the findings from the analysis via grounded theory included aspects that we did not find when analysing the metaphors.
