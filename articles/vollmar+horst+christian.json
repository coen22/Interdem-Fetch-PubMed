A\u00a0key strategic document for the near future is the national dementia strategy (NDS), which defines four fields of action including promoting excellent research on dementia. The NDS will guide and influence the further development of dementia healthcare research in the coming years.","The current research on specific NDS topics is presented and an outlook on expected developments is given.","This article provides a\u00a0narrative review in which concepts and examples for selected sections of the NDS are presented: funding and promotion of healthcare research, development of evidence-based prevention and healthcare concepts and transfer into routine care, support for people with dementia (PwD) and their caregiver, cross-sectoral networking, participation in dementia research and networks in healthcare research. These were analyzed with respect to future developments and concretized based on current healthcare and promotion models.","Insights are given into the healthcare concept of dementia care management, rethinking regional healthcare models such as medicine and e\u2011health. The innovation fund and research practice networks are described as examples of current structural methods of evidence-based design of future healthcare.","The NDS represents an ambitious agenda with very comprehensive goals and topics for the improvement of healthcare for PwD and will probably significantly influence healthcare research and thus healthcare in the future. Overarching, mutually influencing and strengthening components on the way to improvement of the situation for PwD and the healthcare system are translation, participation and networking in research."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Boekholt","ForeName":"Melanie","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"AG

one of the most prevalent diseases in the older population. Various dementia care models have been developed to address patient's healthcare needs. They can be described as \"collaborative care\" or \"person-centered care\". Referring to the needs of the workforce working with persons with dementia, a\u00a0key element is the use of interprofessional education (IPE).","The purpose of this article is to describe different international collaborative care models to define a\u00a0minimum standard of healthcare professions for collaborative dementia care in primary care. This helps to identify requirements for IPE to optimize care of people with dementia and to support informal caregivers in the future.","In this article six dementia care models from 4 different countries (Germany, USA, UK and Netherlands) are described and compared regarding aims, interventions and healthcare professionals involved.","Care teams are minimally comprised of general practitioners or primary care providers, nurses, and social workers. Additional healthcare disciplines may be involved for specific interventions. Mostly, care team members received specific training but such training did not necessarily incorporate the IPE approach. To ensure successful collaboration of professions, IPE training programs should at least consist of the following core topics: (1) early diagnosis, (2) postdiagnostic support, (3) advanced care planning for patients and caregivers and (4) effective collaborative care.","The IPE programs for dementia should be expanded and must be widely implemented in order to assess the impact on collaborative practice. This study will provide the knowledge base for structuring IPE trainings developing educational agendas and adapting existing guidelines to improve collaborative dementia care in the future."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dreier-Wolfgramm","ForeName":"Adina","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Community Medicine, Dept.

and psychological symptoms like apathy, agitation, and anxiety. According to analyses of prescription prevalence in Germany, antipsychotic drugs are regularly prescribed as first-line treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia, although guidelines clearly prioritise non-pharmacological interventions. Frequently, antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for inappropriate reasons and for too long without regular reviewing. The use of antipsychotics is associated with adverse events like increased risk of falling, stroke, and mortality. The aim of the study is to investigate whether a person-centred care approach, successfully evaluated in nursing homes in the United Kingdom, can be implemented in German nursing homes and, in comparison with a control group, can result in a clinically relevant reduction of the proportion of residents with antipsychotic prescriptions.","The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial comparing an intervention group (two-day initial training on person-centred care and ongoing training and support programme) with a control group. Both study groups will receive, as optimised usual care, a medication review by an experienced psychiatrist\/geriatrician providing feedback to the prescribing physician. Overall, 36 nursing homes in East, North, and West Germany will be randomised. The primary outcome is the proportion of residents receiving at least one antipsychotic prescription (long-term medication) after 12\u00a0months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes are residents' quality of life, agitated behaviour, as well as safety parameters like falls and fall-related medical attention. A health economic evaluation and a process evaluation will be performed alongside the study.","To improve care, a reduction of the current high prescription rate of antipsychotics in nursing homes by the intervention programme is expected.","ClinicalTrials.gov:

A diagnosis of dementia does not per se preclude driving. The majority of elderly people would accept discussing fitness to drive with their GP. In Germany, GPs are not obliged to assess fitness to drive, or to report unsafe drivers to the Licensing Agency, but under certain conditions they do have the right to report. Addressing the issue of driving and dementia early with the patient seems to be a prerequisite for a resource-oriented and patient-centred management.","The distinction between medical, ethical-communicative, and legal aspects enabled us to break down this complex problem and thus provide the informative basis to draft tailored recommendations.

A research question that emanated from this discussion was whether appropriate QI might be developed based on German general practice guidelines. In spring 2010, the DEGAM guideline committee (SLK) decided to conduct a project on guideline-based development of QIs using the DEGAM guidelines for dementia, neck pain and sore throat. All members of the SLK were invited to participate in the development process which comprised three face-to-face meetings and four paper-pencil ratings. Finally, 17 QIs for the three guidelines on dementia (n=8), neck pain (n=7) and sore throat (n=2) emerged. These QIs received different ratings in the dimensions relevance, practicability, and appropriateness for public reporting as well as for pay for performance. In this project, guideline authors themselves developed QIs based on German general practice guidelines for the first time ever. Not before practice administration systems facilitate the availability of data in the context of clinical documentation, the practicability of the new QIs can be proven in real every-day practice.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012.

actively approaching counseling and caregiver support groups with differing intensity against usual care with respect to time to institutionalization in patients with dementia.","Within this three-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial, 390 community-dwelling patients aged 65 years or older with physician-diagnosed mild to moderate dementia and their caregivers were enrolled via 129 general practitioners in Middle Franconia, Germany. The intervention included general practitioners' training in dementia care and their recommendation of support groups and actively approaching caregiver counseling. Primary study end point was time to institutionalization over 2 years. In addition, long-term intervention effects were assessed over a time horizon of 4 years. Secondary end points included cognitive functioning, (instrumental) activities of daily living, burden of caregiving, and health-related quality of life after 2 years. Frailty models with strict intention-to-treat approach and mixed linear models were applied to account for cluster randomization. Health care costs were assessed from the societal perspective.","After 2 (4) years, 12% (24%) of the patients were institutionalized and another 21% (35%) died before institutionalization. No significant differences between study groups were observed with respect to time to institutionalization after 2 and 4 years (P 0.25 and 0.71, respectively). Secondary end points deteriorated, but differences were not significant between study groups. Almost 80% of the health care costs were due to informal care. Total annual costs amounted to more than \u20ac47,000 per patient and did not differ between study arms.","The intervention showed no effects on time to institutionalization and secondary outcomes."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

In the context of the three-armed cluster-randomized IDA trial (IDA = \"Initiative Demenzversorgung in der Allgemeinmedizin\"; Dementia Management Initiative in General Medicine), general practitioners (GPs) from the trial area (Bavaria, Germany) were trained in the diagnosis and treatment of dementia.","The educational training concept was based on the evidence-based guideline of Witten\/Herdecke University (UWH). All participating GPs (n = 137, January 2006) received three hours training in the diagnosis of dementia. In addition, a subgroup was trained for two hours in dementia therapy (n = 90). Both groups obtained information about the study design. The didactic concept included screen and oral presentations by opinion leaders, video and interactive elements. At the beginning of the training sessions participants had to fill in a pilot-tested questionnaire with 20 multiple choice questions addressing the diagnosis and therapy of dementia (pretest). The same questionnaire was completed at the end of the training session (posttest) complemented by an evaluation sheet.

Mid 2005 IDA was started by the AOK Bavaria as a pilot project targeting patients living at home. This three-armed cluster-randomized trial--currently including 180 participating general practitioners--is to compare two supportive measures of different intensity (counseling for care-giving relatives and care management) with the usual care in terms of time to nursing home placement. Additional outcomes investigated include the development of the patient's cognitive status and his abilities to perform activities of daily living, burden and quality of life of care-giving relatives as well as healthcare costs and costs of institutional care. Participating patients with initially mild to moderate disease will be observed for a period of two years. Data collection will proceed via general practitioners and caregivers and also utilize routine data of statutory health insurances and long-term care insurances. Keeping in mind that patient recruitment is ongoing throughout 2006 the initial analysis of 254 patients' data shows an average 80-year old patient in the early phase of moderate dementia. One third of the participants are cases with a first- time diagnosis obtained from their general practitioner. Final results for IDA are expected to be available in 2009."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lauterberg","ForeName":"J\u00f6rg","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"joerg.lauterberg@bv.aok.de"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grossfeld-Schmitz","ForeName":"Maria","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ruckd\u00e4schel","ForeName":"Stephan","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Neubauer","ForeName":"Simone","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mehlig","ForeName":"Hilmar","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gaudig","ForeName":"Maren","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hruschka","ForeName":"Dieter","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vollmar","ForeName":"Horst Christian","Initials":"HC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holle","ForeName":"Rolf","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gr\u00e4ssel","ForeName":"Elmar","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"ger","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"VernacularTitle":"Projekt IDA - Konzept und Umsetzung einer cluster-randomisierten Studie zur Demenzver- sorgung im haus\u00e4rztlichen Bereich."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Germany","MedlineTA":"Z Arztl Fortbild Qualitatssich","NlmUniqueID":"9707934","ISSNLinking":"1431-7621"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cluster Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Counseling"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Germany"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"4","Day":"27","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"2","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"4","Day":"27","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17458361","10.1016\/j.zgesun.2006.12.004"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16328187","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"01","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0723-5003","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"100","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Nov","Day":"15"}},"Title":"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)","ISOAbbreviation":"Med Klin (Munich)"},"ArticleTitle":"[Concerning the contribution by Thomas Kaiser, Christiane Florack, Heinrich Franz, Peter Sawicki: donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's dementia.
