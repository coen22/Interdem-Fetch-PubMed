The province is considering extending the practice to incompetent patients. We compared the attitudes of four groups of stakeholders toward extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia.","We conducted a province-wide postal survey in random samples of older adults, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, nurses, and physicians caring for patients with dementia. Clinical vignettes featuring a patient with Alzheimer's disease were used to measure the acceptability of extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia. Vignettes varied according to the stage of the disease (advanced or terminal) and type of request (written or oral only). We used the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach to compare attitudes across groups and vignettes.","Response rates ranged from 25% for physicians to 69% for informal caregivers. In all four groups, the proportion of respondents who felt it was acceptable to extend MAID to an incompetent patient with dementia was highest when the patient was at the terminal stage, showed signs of distress, and had written a MAID request prior to losing capacity. In those circumstances, this proportion ranged from 71% among physicians to 91% among informal caregivers.","We found high support in Quebec for extending the current MAID legislation to incompetent patients with dementia who have reached the terminal stage, appear to be suffering, and had requested MAID in writing while still competent."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons,

indicators (QIs) germane to the international practice of primary care providers (PCP) in post-acute and long-term care in order to demonstrate the added value of medical providers in nursing homes (NHs). A 7-member international team identified and adapted existing QIs to the AMDA competencies for medical providers. QI sources included the ACOVE 3 Quality Indicators (2007), NH Quality Indicators (2004), NH Residential Care Quality Indicators (2002), and AGS Choosing Wisely (2014). We recruited a technical expert panel (TEP) consisting of 11 panelists from the US, Canada, and the European Union, selected for their knowledge and leadership in post-acute and long-term care. The TEP, using a RAND Modified Delphi approach, provided pre-meeting ratings, discussed items in-person for clarification, and re-rated items following discussion. When panelists rated more than 1 option for a particular QI as valid and feasible, the most stringent option was selected for inclusion in the final candidate set of QIs. Panelists confidentially rated an initial 103 items on validity and feasibility of implementation. During the meeting, panelists added 18 QIs and modified 18. In post-meeting analysis, we eliminated 7 QIs rated not valid and 9 QIs for which a more stringent QI was rated valid and feasible. This resulted in a final set of 97 QIs rated valid and feasible and 8 rated valid but not feasible. This set of QIs for PCPs in the NH identified practices in which provider engagement adds value through expertise in geriatric syndromes, employing evidence-based practice, advocating for residents, delivering person-centered care, facilitating advance care planning, and communicating effectively to coordinate care. Next steps include pilot testing and evaluating the association between adherence to QIs, PCP staffing models, and better outcomes.","CopyrightInformation":"Published by Elsevier Inc."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mays","ForeName":"Allison Moser","Initials":"AM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Section of Geriatric Medicine instead of Section of Geriatrics; City and State: Los Angeles, CA."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Saliba","ForeName":"Debra","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"UCLA\/Jewish Home Borun Center for Gerontological Research, University of California, Los Angeles, CA; Geriatrics Research Education and Clinical Center, Veterans Affair Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, CA; The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA.

Global cognitive functioning was evaluated with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the oral function was evaluated with subjective and objective assessments, including the perceived quality of chewing and swallowing, the function of the prostheses, the number of occluding pairs (OP), the degree of tooth wear and the active and passive maximum mouth opening.","The quality of chewing and swallowing was perceived as good in, respectively, 86.0% and 90.9% of the participants. Full or partial prostheses were worn by 63.8% of the participants, and the retention was good in 58.4% of the upper and 50.0% of the lower prostheses. Participants with MCI had a median of 3.0 (Inter Quartile Range [IQR] 0.0-7.5) occluding pairs, while participants with dementia had a median of 0.0 (IQR 0.0-1.0) occluding pairs, U\u00a0=\u00a03838.50, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001. There was a weak positive correlation between the number of occluding pairs and the MMSE score, r\u00a0=\u00a00.267, also when adjusted for age, r\u00a0=\u00a00.230. The median tooth wear score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0-2.0) in participants with MCI or dementia. The active maximum mouth opening was 45.8 (SD 9.3) mm in participants with dementia, while it was 49.8 (SD 8.1) mm in those with MCI, t(253)\u00a0=\u00a02.67, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008.","For most participants with MCI or dementia, the swallowing ability and chewing ability were perceived as good. In addition, more than half of the prostheses had good retention and occlusion. Participants with more severe cognitive impairment had fewer occluding pairs and a smaller active mouth opening. The degree of tooth wear was less than one-third of the clinical crown in most participants with MCI or dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

discusses how and by whom family caregivers want to be supported in self-management when managing changes in behavior and mood of relatives with dementia and whether family caregivers consider eHealth a useful tool for self-management support. Four asynchronous online focus groups were held with 32 family caregivers of individuals with dementia. Transcripts of the online focus groups were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. Family caregivers need support from professionals or peers in the form of (a) information about dementia and its symptoms, (b) tips and advice on managing changes in behavior and mood, (c) opportunities to discuss experiences and feelings, and (d) appreciation and acknowledgement of caregiving. The opinions of family caregivers about self-management support through eHealth were also reported. Findings suggest a personal approach is essential to self-management support for family caregivers managing changes in behavior and mood of relatives with dementia. In addition, self-management support can be provided to some extent through eHealth, but this medium cannot replace personal contacts entirely.

On December 10, 2015, Quebec became the first Canadian province to give access to medical aid in dying (MAiD) (ie, euthanasia performed by a physician) to competent patients who satisfy strictly defined criteria. Less than 2 years later, Quebec is considering extending MAiD to incompetent patients who made an advance request. With the objective of contributing scientific data to current societal debates, we conducted a survey among 471 informal caregivers of persons with dementia, reached through Alzheimer Societies. We used a series of vignettes featuring a person with Alzheimer disease to investigate respondents' attitudes towards MAiD. The response rate was 69%. Two-thirds [68%; 95% confidence interval, 63%-73%] found it acceptable to extend MAiD to an incompetent patient at an advanced stage of Alzheimer disease who had made a written request while competent, and 91% (95% confidence interval, 87%-94%) found it acceptable at the terminal stage. Self-determination was the most widely endorsed argument in favor of access to MAiD for incompetent patients. Findings suggest strong support among informal caregivers for extending MAiD to incompetent patients, provided they are terminally-ill and had made a written request before losing capacity."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bravo","ForeName":"Gina","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences."},{"Affiliation":"Research Centre on Aging, University Institute of Geriatrics of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rodrigue","ForeName":"Claudie","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Centre on Aging, University Institute of Geriatrics of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Arcand","ForeName":"Marcel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Research Centre on Aging, University Institute of Geriatrics of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downie","ForeName":"Jocelyn","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Schulich School of Law and Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dubois","ForeName":"Marie-France","Initials":"MF","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences."},{"Affiliation":"Research Centre on Aging, University Institute of Geriatrics of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kaasalainen","ForeName":"Sharon","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Family Medicine, School of Nursing, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees M","Initials":"CM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice & Elderly Care Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, and EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pautex","ForeName":"Sophie","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Community Medicine and Primary Care, Geneva University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van den Block","ForeName":"Lieve","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"VUB-UGhent End-of-life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord","NlmUniqueID":"8704771","ISSNLinking":"0893-0341"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Advance Directives"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Euthanasia"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Competency","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Physicians","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Quebec"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29283927","10.1097\/WAD.0000000000000238"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29143189","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"09","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1436-3771","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Clinical oral investigations","ISOAbbreviation":"Clin Oral Investig"},"ArticleTitle":"Oral hygiene and oral health in older people with dementia: a comprehensive review with focus on oral soft tissues.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"93-108"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s00784-017-2264-2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The number of older people with dementia and a natural dentition is growing.

Within 2\u2009weeks after death, 103 physicians completed questionnaires about the last phase of life in 330 residents with dementia who resided in 1 of 34 participating long-term care facilities. We used descriptive statistics.","Advance directives were rare (4.9%). A minority was hospitalized (8.0%) in the last month (mainly for fractures) or received antibiotics (24.2%) in the last week (mainly for pneumonia). Four residents received tube feeding or rehydration therapy in the last week. In almost half of the residents (42.3%), decisions were made not to start potentially life-prolonging treatment such as hospital transfer and artificial nutrition and hydration. In more than half of the residents (53.7%), decisions were made to withdraw potentially life-prolonging treatment such as artificial nutrition and hydration and medication. Antibiotics were more frequently prescribed for residents with less advanced dementia, but otherwise there were no differences in treatment decisions between residents with advanced and less advanced dementia.","Physicians often withhold potentially burdensome life-prolonging treatment in nursing home residents in all stages of dementia in the Netherlands.

We sought to assess the effectiveness of a practice guideline for optimal symptom relief for nursing home residents with dementia and pneumonia.","A single-blind, multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32 Dutch nursing homes. Outcomes were assessed on the patient level. The main outcome measures were discomfort and symptoms: discomfort (DS-DAT: Discomfort Scale-Dementia of Alzheimer Type), (lack of) comfort (EOLD-CAD: End Of Life in Dementia-Comfort Assessment in Dying), pain (PAINAD: Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia), and respiratory distress (RDOS: Respiratory Distress Observation Scale). Outcomes were scheduled daily from diagnosis until 10\u00a0days later and a final time between 13-15 days from diagnosis by trained observers who were blinded to the intervention and the residents' condition and treatment. In a pre-intervention phase, usual care was provided to all homes. In the intervention phase, matched clusters of homes were randomized to either the control (n\u2009=\u200916) or intervention condition (n\u2009=\u200916).","Between 1 January 2012 and 1 May 2015, 464 episodes of pneumonia were included. Outcomes were obtained for 399 episodes in 367 residents. Longitudinal multilevel linear regression analyses were performed on log-transformed outcomes, so coefficients should be interpreted as a ratio, and a coefficient of 1 means no difference. The practice guideline in the intervention phase did not reduce the level of discomfort and symptoms: DS-DAT: 1.11 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93-1.31), EOLD-CAD: 1.01 (95\u00a0% CI 0.98-1.05), PAINAD: 1.04 (95\u00a0% CI 0.93-1.15), RDOS: 1.11 (95\u00a0% CI 0.90-1.24). However, in both the intervention and control groups, lack of comfort and respiratory distress gradually decreased during the entire 3.5\u00a0years of data collection, and were lower in the intervention phase compared to the pre-intervention phase: DS-DAT: 0.93 (95\u00a0% CI 0.85-1.01), EOLD-CAD: 0.98 (95\u00a0% CI 0.97-1.00), PAINAD: 0.96 (95\u00a0% CI 0.91-1.01), RDOS: 0.92 (95\u00a0% CI 0.87-0.98).","When compared to usual care, the practice guideline for optimal symptom relief did not relieve discomfort and symptoms in nursing home residents with dementia and pneumonia. However, discomfort and symptoms decreased gradually throughout the data collection in both the intervention homes and the control homes. An intervention that focuses on creating awareness may be more effective than a physician practice guideline.","The Netherlands National Trial Register (ID number NTR5071 .

use of a practice guideline for optimal symptom relief for patients with dementia and pneumonia in Dutch nursing homes.","A process evaluation included assessment of reach, fidelity, and dose delivered using researcher's observations, and dose received was addressed in a question \"use of the practice guideline,\" which the physicians completed for each patient included in the study. Perceived barriers were assessed with a structured questionnaire (response 69%) and semi-structured interviews (n\u2009=\u200914), which were subject to qualitative content analysis.","Of the 55 physicians involved in the intervention phase, 87% attended an implementation meeting; 20 physicians joined the study later (reach). The intervention was implemented as planned, and all intervention components were delivered by the researchers (fidelity and dose delivered). Thirty-six physicians included 109 patients. For 81% of the patients, the treating physician stated to have used the guideline (dose received). The guideline was perceived as providing a good overview of current practice, but some physicians had expected a more directive protocol or algorithm. Further, recommended regular observations of symptoms were rarely performed. Physician's often felt that \"this is not different from what we usually do,\" and with the acute illness, there was not always enough time to (re)familiarize with the contents.","The physicians used the practice guideline frequently despite important barriers. Future implementation may involve strategies such as multiple interactive meetings. Further, the greatest potential to alter usual practice should be emphasized, such as using observational instruments.

It has been hypothesized that pain perception differs between dementia subtypes, and therefore, the prevalence of pain differs between dementia subtypes. However, there remains a paucity of evidence on the differences in the prevalence of pain in different dementia subtypes.

Most of these studies reported on AD; studies reporting the prevalence of pain in people with DLB were scarce, and for FTD, we found no studies. The sample-weighted prevalence of pain could only be calculated for AD, VaD and mixed dementia: AD 45.8% (95% confidence interval, CI: 33.4-58.5%), VaD 56.2% (95% CI: 47.7-64.4%) and mixed dementia 53.9% (95% CI: 37.4-70.1%).","Studies investigating the prevalence of pain in dementia subtypes were scarce; however, we found a high prevalence of pain in dementia without significant differences between the dementia subtypes.

The aim of this study is to give insight into why these changes in behavior and mood are stressful for family caregivers, what self-management strategies family caregivers use when managing these changes and the stress they experience.","A qualitative study was conducted using four online focus groups with 32 family caregivers of people with dementia living in the Netherlands. Transcripts of the focus group discussions were analyzed using principles of thematic analysis.","Managing changes in the behavior and mood of their relative with dementia is stressful for family caregivers because of constantly having to switch, continuously having to keep the person with dementia occupied and distracted, the fact that others see a different side to the relative, and the fact that caregivers know what to do, but are often not able to put this into practice. Caregivers use calming down and stimulation as self-management strategies for influencing the changes in the behavior and mood of their relative. Furthermore, caregivers describe three self-management strategies that let them manage their own stress and keep up the care for their loved ones: looking for distractions, getting rest, and discussing their feelings and experiences.","Behavior and mood changes of a person with dementia are stressful for family caregivers.

This paper reviews and reflects on the currently available theories on subjective experience in dementia and it explores the possibility of a knowledge gap on the influence of neurological deficits on experience in late stage dementia.","A literature review on current commonly used theories on experience in dementia was supplemented with a systematic review in PubMed and Psychinfo. For the systematic review, the terms used were Perception and Dementia and Behavior; and Awareness and Dementia and Long term care.","Current models emphasize the psychosocial factors that influence subjective experience, but the consequences of neurological deficits are not elaborated upon. The systematic literature search on the neuropsychological functioning in dementia resulted in 631 papers, of which 94 were selected for review. The current knowledge is limited to the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Next to memory impairments, perception of the direct environment, interpretation of the environment, and inhibition of own responses to the environment seem to be altered in people with dementia.","Without knowledge on how perception, interpretation and the ability for response control are altered, the behavior of people with dementia can easily be misinterpreted. Research into neuropsychological functioning of people in more severe stages and different forms of dementia is needed to be able to develop a model that is truly biopsychosocial.

Panellists rated the relevance of various statements addressing essential components of resilience; 'adversity' and 'successful caregiving' on a 5-point Likert scale.

Interviews were coded and analyzed to find themes.","Family, nurses, and physicians of all patients indicated they had multiple contact moments during nursing home stay in which care goals and treatment decisions were discussed. Nearly all interviewees indicated that physicians took the initiative for these ACP discussions. Care goals discussed and established during nursing home stay and the terminology to describe care goals varied between facilities. Regardless of care goals and other factors, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and hospitalization were always discussed in advance with family and commonly resulted in a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and a do-not-hospitalize (DNH) order. The timing of care planning discussions about other specific treatments or conditions and the content of treatment decisions varied. The factors that emerged from the interviews as related to ACP were general strategies that guided physicians in initiating ACP discussions, patient's condition, wishes expressed by patient or family, family's willingness, family involvement, continuity of communication, consensus with or within family, and general nursing home policy. Two influential underlying strategies guided physicians in initiating ACP discussions: (1) wait for a reason to initiate discussions, such as a change in health condition and (2) take initiative to discuss possible treatments (actively, including describing scenarios).","ACP is a multifactorial process, which may lean on professional caregivers' guidance. The most acute decisions are covered in advance, but a responsive as well as a proactive style is seen with other treatment decisions. Further research is needed to increase understanding of whether and how the physicians' strategies affect care processes and outcomes."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

On behalf of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC), we recently performed a Delphi study to define domains for palliative care in dementia and to provide recommendations for optimal care. An international panel of experts in palliative care, dementia care or both, achieved consensus on almost all domains and recommendations, but the domain concerning the applicability of palliative care to dementia required revision.","To examine in detail, the opinions of the international panel of 64 experts around the applicability of palliative care, we explored feedback they provided in the Delphi process. To examine which experts found it less important or less applicable, ordinal regression analyses related characteristics of the panelists to ratings of overall importance of the applicability domain, and to agreement with the domain's four recommendations.","Some experts expressed concerns about bringing up end-of-life issues prematurely and about relabeling dementia care as palliative care. Multivariable analyses with the two outcomes of importance and agreement with applicability indicated that younger or less experienced experts and those whose expertise was predominantly in dementia care found palliative care in dementia less important and less applicable.","Benefits of palliative care in dementia are acknowledged by experts worldwide, but there is some controversy around its early introduction.

In this study, the prevalence of pain in people with dementia will be investigated per dementia subtype and the relationship between the various subtypes of dementia and the presence of specific types of pain (i.e. musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain and orofacial pain) will be examined. Secondly, associations between various types of pain, cognitive functioning, neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia will be examined. A third purpose is to study the value of the assessment of autonomic responses in assessing pain in people with dementia. Finally, the effect of feedback to the attending physician on the presence of pain, based on examination by investigators with backgrounds in neuropsychology, geriatric dentistry and elderly care medicine, will be evaluated.","A cross-sectional, partially longitudinal observational study in 400 participants with dementia, aged 60\u00a0years and older.

But there are fears that such use might attenuate the care relationship.","To investigate how surveillance technology is actually being used by nurses and support staff in residential care facilities for people with dementia or intellectual disabilities, in order to explore the possible benefits and drawbacks of this technology in practice.","An ethnographic field study was carried out in two residential care facilities: a nursing home for people with dementia and a facility for people with intellectual disabilities. Data were collected through field observations and informal conversations as well as through formal interviews.","Five overarching themes on the use of surveillance technology emerged from the data: continuing to do rounds, alarm fatigue, keeping clients in close proximity, locking the doors, and forgetting to take certain devices off. Despite the presence of surveillance technology, participants still continued their rounds. Alarm fatigue sometimes led participants to turn devices off. Though the technology allowed wandering clients to be tracked more easily, participants often preferred keeping clients nearby, and preferably behind locked doors at night. At times participants forgot to remove less visible devices (such as electronic bracelets) when the original reason for use expired.","A more nuanced view of the benefits and drawbacks of surveillance technology is called for. Study participants tended to incorporate surveillance technology into existing care routines and to do so with some reluctance and reservation. They also tended to favor certain technologies, for example, making intensive use of certain devices (such as digital enhanced cordless telecommunications phones) while demonstrating ambivalence about others (such as the tagging and tracking systems). Client safety and physical proximity seemed to be dominant values, suggesting that the fear that surveillance technology will cause attenuation of the care relationship is unfounded. On the other hand, the values of client freedom and autonomy seemed less influential; participants often appeared unwilling to take risks with the technology. Care facilities wishing to implement surveillance technology should encourage ongoing dialogue on how staff members view and understand the concepts of autonomy and risk. A clear and well-formulated vision for the use of surveillance technology-one understood and supported by all stakeholders-seems imperative to successful implementation."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Niemeijer","ForeName":"Alistair R","Initials":"AR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alistair R.

These patients may benefit from a palliative care goal, focused on comfort. Admission may be a good time to revisit or develop care plans.","To describe care goals in nursing home patients with dementia and factors associated with establishing a comfort care goal.","We used generalized estimating equation regression analyses for baseline analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses for longitudinal analyses.","Prospective data collection in 28 Dutch facilities, mostly nursing homes (2007-2010; Dutch End of Life in Dementia study, DEOLD).","Eight weeks after admission (baseline), 56.7% of 326 patients had a comfort care goal. At death, 89.5% had a comfort care goal. Adjusted for illness severity, patients with a baseline comfort care goal were more likely to have a religious affiliation, to be less competent to make decisions, and to have a short survival prediction. Their families were less likely to prefer life-prolongation and more likely to be satisfied with family-physician communication. Compared with patients with a comfort care goal established later during their stay, patients with a baseline comfort care goal also more frequently had a more highly educated family member.","Initially, over half of the patients had a care goal focused on comfort, increasing to the large majority of the patients at death. Optimizing patient-family-physician communication upon admission may support the early establishing of a comfort care goal. Patient condition and family views play a role, and physicians should be aware that religious affiliation and education may also affect the (timing of) setting a comfort care goal."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Soest-Poortvliet","ForeName":"Mirjam

on Challenging Behavior care program for managing challenging behavior was implemented in the dementia special care units of 17 Dutch nursing homes. A process evaluation of the implementation of the care program was performed to determine the quality of the implementation and the lessons to be learned for future implementation.","The care program was implemented according to a stepped wedge design. First-order data (data on recruitment, reach, relevance and feasibility) were used to determine the validity of the study, and second-order data (intervention quality and the barriers and facilitators for implementing the care program) were used to describe the implementation process. Two structured questionnaires were administered to care staff and key stakeholders and semi-structured interviews were held in the units.","University affiliated and non-affiliated nursing homes from different parts of the Netherlands participated. The resident participation rate was over 95% and the participation rate for the training sessions was 82%. Respondents considered the care program relevant and feasible. The degree of implementation was not optimal. The barriers and facilitators in implementing the care program could be divided into three categories: organizational aspects, culture on the unit and aspects of the care program itself.","The recruitment, reach, relevance and feasibility are sufficient to allow for analysis and generalization of the effects of the care program, but the degree of implementation should be taken into account in further analysis.

In the Grip on Challenging Behaviour study, a care programme was developed to improve the management of challenging behaviour.","In developing the care programme, the overlapping parts of dementia care guidelines were supplemented with discipline-specific parts. Three meetings with experts were arranged to further develop the structure of the care programme and to ensure a good fit with practice.","The care programme consists of four steps: detection, analysis, treatment, and evaluation. For each step, forms were developed to guide and structure the process and assign responsibilities for each discipline.

Since Alzheimer is a progressive disease, studying the hierarchy of the items in the scale can be useful to evaluate the progression of the disease. Data from 164 Alzheimer's patients and 186 patients with other dementia were analyzed using the Mokken Scaling Methodology to determine whether respondents can be ordered in the trait dementia severity, and to study whether an ordering between the items exist. The scalability of the scale was evaluated by the H coefficient. Results showed that the BANS-S is a reliable and medium scale (0.4\u2264H<0.5) for the Alzheimer group. All items with the exception of the item about mobility could be ordered. When later item was eliminated from the scale, the H coefficient decreased indicating that the scalability of the scale in the original form is more accurate than in the shorter version. For the other dementia group, the BANS-S did not fit any of the Mokken Scaling models because the scale was not unidimensional. In this group, a shorter version of the scale without the sleeping cycle item and the mobility item has better reliability and scalability properties than the original scale.

The experiences of living through dementia as told by the sufferers appear to yield a more subtle picture than the assumptions made by the general public.","The overview provides a good starting point for improving the adjustment of care to the experience and wishes of people with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Boer","ForeName":"Marike E","Initials":"ME","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing Home Medicine, Institute for Research in Extramural Medicine, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.deboer@vumc.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees M P M","Initials":"CM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dr\u00f6es","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Riphagen","ForeName":"Ingrid I","Initials":"II"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jonker","ForeName":"Cees","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"Jan A","Initials":"JA"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Advance Directives"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Emotions"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Prejudice"},{"DescriptorName":"Problem Solving"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Sick Role"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"85"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"31","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"3","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"31","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17727738","S1041610207005765","10.1017\/S1041610207005765"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17454999","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"05","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2007","Month":"04","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1536-0075","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"7","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"The American journal of bioethics : AJOB","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Bioeth"},"ArticleTitle":"Would we rather lose our life than lose our self?

It discusses the ethical and practical dilemmas created by euthanasia requests in advance directives and the related inconsistencies in the Dutch legal regulations regarding euthanasia\/assisted suicide. After an initial focus on euthanasia in advanced dementia, the actual debate concentrates on making euthanasia\/assisted suicide possible in the very early stages of dementia. A review of the few known cases of assisted suicide of people with so-called early dementia raises the question why requests for euthanasia\/assisted suicide from patients in the early stage of (late onset) Alzheimer's disease are virtually non-existent. In response to this question two explanations are offered. It is concluded that, in addition to a moral discussion on the limits of anticipatory choices, there is an urgent need to develop research into the patient's perspective with regard to medical treatment and care-giving in dementia, including end-of-life care."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees M P M","Initials":"CM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing Home Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre, Institute for Research in Extramural Medicine."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Boer","ForeName":"Marike E","Initials":"ME"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dr\u00f6es","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"Jan A","Initials":"JA"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Bioeth","NlmUniqueID":"100898738","ISSNLinking":"1526-5161"},"CitationSubset":["E","IM"],"CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":[{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Am J Bioeth. 2007 Apr;7(4):57-8;

To this end an ethnographical field study was carried out by two researchers in two Dutch nursing homes. Among the central topics that evolved were the different moral problems that nurses experience concerning truth telling and acting truthfully in relation to demented patients. In situations unrelated to the dementia and its diagnosis, the right to be informed is in principle respected, even if the information is sometimes painful. More specific questions of demented patients about their situation are a regular cause of embarrassment for their carers, who rely on various treatment strategies to deal with such questions. These strategies are often successful. However, when they fail, the nurses are faced with a problem they cannot solve, namely the loss of a common shared world and the resulting unmentionable truth about the diagnosis of dementia, as objective basis and legitimization for their approach to the demented patient. We conclude that in the training and professional support given to nurses, more attention should be paid to (awareness of) the moral problems that arise from this loss of a common shared world, so that they can react to the subjective world of demented patients without feeling that they are deceiving them."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees M P M","Initials":"CM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing Home Medicine, Institute for Research in Extramural Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre, Van der Boechorststraat 7, Amsterdam 1081 BT, The Netherlands. cmpm.hertogh.gpnh@med.vu.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"The","ForeName":"B Anne Mei","Initials":"BA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Miesen","ForeName":"Bere M L","Initials":"BM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"Jan A","Initials":"JA"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Soc Sci Med","NlmUniqueID":"8303205","ISSNLinking":"0277-9536"},"CitationSubset":["E","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Anthropology, Cultural"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Freedom"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Truth Disclosure"}]},"OtherID":["129299","VF 8.2"],"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"KIE"},"Keyword":["Empirical Approach","Professional Patient Relationship"]},"GeneralNote":["20 refs.","KIE Bib: patient care\/mentally disabled; truth disclosure"]},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"29","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"12","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"29","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15279925","10.1016\/j.socscimed.2004.02.015","S0277953604000747"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15230053","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"08","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0167-9228","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"35","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie","ISOAbbreviation":"Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"[The law and the local fairness of care practice.

Ethnographic research into moral problems related to care giving in dementia patients in Dutch nursing homes yielded several reasons for this discrepancy between law and care practice. Firstly, practical effectuation of this law rests predominantly on the shoulders of nurses and nurse assistants who are mainly inspired by moral motives such as carefulness and providing safety and who are ill informed about the law and its prerequisites. Secondly, there is the problem of the loss of a common shared world of meaning, which in relational terms is typical for the process of dementia. As a result of this, crucial concepts of the Bopz loose their applicability as the disease progresses. Finally, there is an immanent tension between the anthropology of care and care giving and the anthropological presuppositions of the law, health law included, which on a fundamental level contributes to the resistance of the care practice to the legal procedures of the Bopz. These factors must be accounted for in new legislation or revision of the current law. In the mean time we urge the necessity to develop a moral code concerning how to deal with resistive behaviour and opposition to care of demented nursing home patients."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"VU Medisch Centrum, EMGO Instituut en afdeling Verpleeghuisgeneeskunde, Van der Boechorststraat 7, 1081 BT Amsterdam. cmpm.hertogh@vumc.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"The","ForeName":"Anne Mei","Initials":"AM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eefsting","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"dut","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Case Reports","Journal Article"]},"VernacularTitle":"De wet en de lokale redelijkheid van de zorgpraktijk: reflecties vanuit etnografisch veldonderzoek over het falen van de Wet Bopz in de psychogeriatrie."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"8210346","ISSNLinking":"0167-9228"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Psychiatry","QualifierName":"legislation & jurisprudence"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services for the Aged","QualifierName":["legislation & jurisprudence","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged","QualifierName":["legislation & jurisprudence","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitals, Psychiatric","QualifierName":["legislation & jurisprudence","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":["legislation & jurisprudence","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Admission","QualifierName":"legislation & jurisprudence"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Advocacy","QualifierName":"legislation & jurisprudence"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"3","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"8","Day":"27","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"3","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15230053"}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12481534","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"01","Day":"14"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0167-9228","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"33","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrie","ISOAbbreviation":"Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"[Mental competence and long term care: an uncomfortable relationship].","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"212-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Competency is an important concept in medical ethics as well as in law. It refers to the moral principles of self-determination and autonomy, which are of central importance in the ethics of health care. These moral principles also prevail in nursing home care. Societal prejudice concerning nursing home patients suggests that the inhabitants of a nursing home are almost by definition incompetent. We assert that such prejudice rests on certain societal delusions and misinterpretations of incompetency five of which are subsequently analysed. Next we discuss the dominant conception of competency in terms of decisional capacity. This conception is predominantly oriented towards cognitive abilities and underplays affective capacities. We confront this dominant conception with an alternative proposal of competency in terms of 'the capacity to value', which--to our opinion--more properly reflects nursing home practice concerning questions of competency. Finally we address the limitations of any concept of competency or decisional capacity in relation to the moral issues of 'good care' for demented elderly. As an alternative we draw attention to the moral perspective of the 'ethics of care'."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Afdeling Verpleeghuisgeneeskunde en EMGO-Instituut, VU Medisch Centrum, Van der Boechorststraat 7, 1081 BT Amsterdam. cmpm.hertogh.gpnh@med.vu.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verkerk","ForeName":"Marian","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"dut","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article"]},"VernacularTitle":"Wilsbekwaamheid en verpleeghuiszorg: een ongemakkelijke verhouding."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"8210346","ISSNLinking":"0167-9228"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Ethics, Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing","QualifierName":["ethics","legislation & jurisprudence"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":["ethics","legislation & jurisprudence"]},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Competency","QualifierName":"legislation & jurisprudence"},{"DescriptorName":"Morals"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":["ethics","legislation & jurisprudence"]},{"DescriptorName":"Personal Autonomy"},{"DescriptorName":"Prejudice"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"1","Day":"15","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12481534"}}}]}
