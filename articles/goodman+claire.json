An example is Namaste Care, a multi-component intervention for people with advanced dementia, delivered in care home, community, hospital and hospice settings. This paper describes the development of an intervention description, guide and training package to support implementation of Namaste Care within the context of a feasibility trial. This allows fidelity to be determined within the trial, and for intervention users to understand how similar their implementation is to that which was studied.","A four-stage approach: a) Collating existing intervention materials and drawing from programme theory developed from a realist review to draft an intervention description. b) Exploring readability, comprehensibility and utility with staff who had not experienced Namaste Care. c) Using modified nominal group techniques with those with Namaste Care experience to refine and prioritise the intervention implementation materials. d) Final refinement with a patient and public involvement panel.","Eighteen nursing care home staff, one carer, one volunteer and five members of our public involvement panel were involved across the study steps. A 16-page A4 booklet was designed, with flow charts, graphics and colour coded information to ease navigation through the document. This was supplemented by infographics, and a training package. The guide describes the boundaries of the intervention and how to implement it, whilst retaining the flexible spirit of the Namaste Care intervention.","There is little attention paid to how best to specify complex interventions that have already been organically implemented in practice. This four-stage process may have utility for context specific adaptation or description of existing, but untested, interventions. A robust, agreed, intervention and implementation description should enable a high-quality future trial. If an effect is determined, flexible practice implementation should be enabled through having a clear, evidence-based guide."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Walshe","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0002-4531-8608","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"International

Among DFC activities, awareness raising was cited most commonly. There was some evidence of involvement of people living with dementia in organisational and operational aspects of DFCs. Approaches to evaluation varied, with little evidence of findings having effected change.","DFCs are characterised by variation in type, resourcing, and activities. England has policy endorsement and a recognition system for DFCs. These can be important catalysts for initiation and growth. A systematic approach to evaluation is lacking. This would enable DFCs to be consistent in how they demonstrate progress and how they enable people living with dementia to live well."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Evidence for their impact on staff actions and patient outcomes is, however, limited and context dependent.","To explain the factors that support hospital staff to provide dementia sensitive care and with what outcomes for patients with dementia.","A realist evaluation using a two-site case study approach.","Two hospital trusts in the East of England. Site 1 had a ward for patients with dementia that would address their medical and mental health needs. Site 2 used a team of healthcare assistants, who had support from dementia specialist nurses, to work with patients with dementia across the hospital.","Hospital staff who had a responsibility for inpatients with dementia (healthcare assistants, nurses, medical staff, allied healthcare professionals and support staff) (n\u2009=\u200936), patients with dementia (n\u2009=\u200928), and family carers of patients with dementia (n\u2009=\u20092).","A three stage realist evaluation: 1) building the programme theory of what works and when; 2) testing the programme theory through empirical data (80\u2009h non-participant observation, 42 interviews, 28 patient medical notes, 27 neuropsychiatric inventory, and documentary review); 3) synthesis and verification of findings with key stakeholders.","The programme theory comprised six interconnected context-mechanism-outcome configurations: 1) knowledge and authority to respond to an unmet need; 2) role relevant training and opportunities for reflection; 3) clinical experts and senior staff promoting practices that are patient-focused; 4) engaging with opportunities to spend time with patients; 5) risk management as an opportunity for person-centred care; 6) valuing dementia care as skilled work. Effective interactions reduced patient distress and supported patient orientation. Training and allocation of staff time were of themselves insufficient to ensure dementia care was prioritised and valued as skilled work. Staff concerns about the consequences of adverse incidents and work pressures on the ward, even with support, took precedence and influenced the quality of their interactions with patients with dementia. A key finding linked to staff retention and developing capacity in the workforce to provide expert dementia care was that despite extra training and organisational endorsement, nursing staff did not regard dementia care as skilled nursing work.","There is increased awareness and organisational commitment to dementia-friendly healthcare in general hospitals. However, in addition to training and adapting the environment to the patient, further work is needed to make explicit the specialist skills required for effective dementia care."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

Multisensory approaches, such as Namaste Care, have been developed to improve the quality of life and dying for people with advanced dementia but little is known about effectiveness or optimum delivery. The aim of this review was to develop an explanatory account of how the Namaste Care intervention might work, on what outcomes, and in what circumstances.","This is a realist review involving scoping of the literature and stakeholder interviews to develop theoretical explanations of how interventions might work, systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories, and their validation with a purposive sample of stakeholders. Twenty stakeholders - user\/patient representatives, dementia care providers, care home staff, researchers -took part in interviews and\/or workshops.","We included 85 papers. Eight focused on Namaste Care and the remainder on other types of sensory interventions such as music therapy or massage. We identified three context-mechanism-outcome configurations which together provide an explanatory account of what needs to be in place for Namaste Care to work for people living with advanced dementia. This includes: providing structured access to social and physical stimulation, equipping care home staff to cope effectively with complex behaviours and variable responses, and providing a framework for person-centred care. A key overarching theme concerned the importance of activities that enabled the development of moments of connection for people with advanced dementia.","This realist review provides a coherent account of how Namaste Care, and other multisensory interventions might work. It provides practitioners and researchers with a framework to judge the feasibility and likely success of Namaste Care in long term settings.

The quality of life, care and dying experienced by these people is variable. Namaste Care is a multisensory programme of care developed for people with advanced dementia. While there is emerging evidence that Namaste Care may be beneficial for people with dementia, there is a need to conduct a feasibility study to establish the optimum way of delivering this complex intervention and whether benefits can be demonstrated in end-of-life care, for individuals and service delivery. The aim of the study is to ascertain the feasibility of conducting a full trial of the Namaste Care intervention.","A feasibility study, comprising a parallel, two-arm, multicentre cluster controlled randomised trial with embedded process and economic evaluation. Nursing care homes (total of eight) who deliver care to those with advanced dementia will be randomly allocated to intervention (delivered at nursing care home level) or control. Three participant groups will be recruited: residents with advanced dementia, informal carers of a participating resident and nursing care home staff. Data will be collected for 6 months. Feasibility objectives concern the recruitment and sampling of nursing homes, residents, informal carers and staff; the selection and timing of primary (quality of dying and quality of life) and secondary clinical outcome measures (person centredness, symptom presence, agitation, quality of life, resource use and costs and residents' activity monitored using actigraphy). Acceptability, fidelity and sustainability of the intervention will be assessed using semistructured interviews with staff and informal carers.","This protocol has been approved by NHS Wales Research Ethics Committee 5 (ref: 17\/WA0378). Dissemination plans include working with a public involvement panel, through a website (http:\/\/www.namastetrial.org.uk), social media, academic and practice conferences and via peer reviewed publications.","ISRCTN14948133; Pre-results."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

dementia to remain active, engaged, and valued members of society. Dementia prevalence varies nationally and is strongly associated with the age and sex distribution of the population and level of social deprivation. As part of a wider project to evaluate DFCs, we examined whether there is a relationship between provision of DFCs and epidemiological need.","Dementia-friendly communities were identified through the formal recognition process of DFC status by the Alzheimer's Society and mapped against areas defined by English Clinical Commissioning Groups. We tested whether provision of a DFC was associated with: (1) dementia prevalence, (2) number of known cases, and (3) known plus estimated number of unknown cases.","Of the 209 English Clinical Commissioning Group areas, 115 had at least one DFC. The presence of a DFC was significantly associated with number of known dementia cases (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0577; 95% CI, 249 to 905; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and unknown dementia cases (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0881; 95% CI, 349 to 1413; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) but not prevalence (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a00.03; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.16; P\u00a0=\u00a00.61). This remains true when controlling for potential confounding variables.","Our findings suggest that DFC provision is consistent with epidemiological-based need. Dementia-friendly communities are located in areas where they can have the greatest impact. A retrospective understanding of how DFCs have developed in England can inform how equivalent international initiatives might be designed and implemented."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2018 The Authors.

dementia is common. Dementia may be related to differential use of health, social and informal care.","Data from two large UK population-based studies (CFAS I & II) of adults aged 65\u00a0years and older were analysed using logistic regression for binary outcomes and Poisson regression for count outcomes to look at differences in non-dementia service use by those with dementia and a health condition in comparison to those with the health condition alone.","A total of 1619 individuals from CFAS I and 3805 individuals from CFAS II over the age of 75\u00a0years were included in this analysis. The presence of dementia and either stroke, diabetes or visual impairment tended to increase the likelihood of a range of different services being used over having any of the health conditions alone. There has been a shift to the use of unpaid care over time. There is now increased use of unpaid care from friends and family by those with dementia and another health condition in comparison to the health condition alone.","Either due to the decrease in care

dementia care.","The aim of this review was to explore how people living with dementia and cognitive impairment can be included in day-to-day decisions about their health and care in extended care settings.","A systematic review including primary research relating to shared decision-making, with cognitively impaired adults in (or transferrable to) extended care settings. Databases searched were: CINAHL, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, NICE Evidence, OpenGrey, Autism Data, Google Scholar, Scopus and Medicines Complete (June to October 2016 and updated 2018) for studies published in the last 20 years.","Of the 19 included studies 15 involved people with living dementia, seven in extended care settings. People living with cognitive impairment often have the desire and ability to participate in decision-making about their everyday care, although this is regularly underestimated by their staff and family care partners. Shared decision-making has the potential to improve quality of life for both the person living with dementia and those who support them. How resources to support shared decision-making are implemented in extended care settings is less well understood.","Evidence suggests that people living with cognitive impairment value opportunities to be involved in everyday decision-making about their care. How these opportunities are created, understood, supported and sustained in extended care settings remains to be determined.","CRD42016035919."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

People living with dementia and diabetes may be at increased risk of complications such as hypoglycaemic episodes because they are less able to manage their diabetes.","To identify the key features or mechanisms of programmes that aim to improve the management of diabetes in people with dementia and to identify areas needing further research.","Realist review, using an iterative, stakeholder-driven, four-stage approach. This involved scoping the literature and conducting stakeholder interviews to develop initial programme theories, systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories, and the validation of programme theories with a purposive sample of stakeholders.","Twenty-six stakeholders (user\/patient representatives, dementia care providers, clinicians specialising in dementia or diabetes and researchers) took part in interviews and 24 participated in a consensus conference.","The following databases were searched from 1990 to March 2016: MEDLINE (PubMed), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, AgeInfo (Centre for Policy on Ageing - UK), Social Care Online, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) portfolio database, NHS Evidence, Google (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) and Google Scholar (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA).","We included 89 papers. Ten papers focused directly on people living with dementia and diabetes, and the rest related to people with dementia or diabetes or other long-term conditions. We identified six context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations that provide an explanatory account of how interventions might work to improve the management of diabetes in people living with dementia. This includes embedding positive attitudes towards people living with dementia, person-centred approaches to care planning, developing skills to provide tailored and flexible care, regular contact, family engagement and usability of assistive devices. A general metamechanism that emerges concerns the synergy between an intervention strategy, the dementia trajectory and social and environmental factors, especially family involvement. A flexible service model for people with dementia and diabetes would enable this synergy in a way that would lead to the improved management of diabetes in people living with dementia.","There is little evidence relating to the management of diabetes in people living with dementia, although including a wider literature provided opportunities for transferable learning. The outcomes in our CMOs are largely experiential rather than clinical. This reflects the evidence available. Outcomes such as increased engagement in self-management are potential surrogates for better clinical management of diabetes, but this is not proven.","This review suggests that there is a need to prioritise quality of life, independence and patient and carer priorities over a more biomedical, target-driven approach. Much current research, particularly that specific to people living with dementia and diabetes, identifies deficiencies in, and problems with, current systems. Although we have highlighted the need for personalised care, continuity and family-centred approaches, there is much evidence to suggest that this is not currently happening. Future research on the management of diabetes in older people with complex health needs, including those with dementia, needs to look at how organisational structures and workforce development can be better aligned to the needs of people living with dementia and diabetes.","This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015020625.","The NIHR HTA programme."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Peter Reece","Initials":"PR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Russell","ForeName":"Bridget","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Trivedi","ForeName":"Daksha","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sinclair","ForeName":"Alan","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Foundation for Diabetes Research in Older People, Diabetes Frail Ltd, Luton, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bayer","ForeName":"Antony","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cochrane Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London Medical School, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rycroft-Malone","ForeName":"Jo","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burton","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"HTA\/13\/138\/03","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Review","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Technol Assess","NlmUniqueID":"9706284","ISSNLinking":"1366-5278"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["education","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Consensus"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Diabetes Mellitus","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29235986","10.3310\/hta21750","PMC5742454"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28859818","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"28"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1538-9375","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"Sep","Day":"01"}},"Title":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","ISOAbbreviation":"J Am Med Dir Assoc"},"ArticleTitle":"What Works to Improve and Manage Fecal Incontinence in Care Home Residents Living With Dementia?

These addressed clinician-led support, assessment, and review; the contribution of teaching and support for care home staff on how to reduce and manage FI; addressing the causes and prevention of constipation; how cognitive and physical capacity of the resident affects outcomes; how the potential for recovery, reduction, and management of FI is understood by those involved; and how the care of people living with dementia and FI is integral to the work patterns of the care home and its staff. Dementia was a known risk factor for fecal incontinence (FI), but how it affected uptake of different interventions or the dementia specific continence and toileting skills staff require, were not addressed in the literature. There was a lack of dementia-specific evidence on continence aids. Most care home residents with FI will be doubly incontinent; there is, therefore, limited value in focusing solely on FI or single causes, such as constipation. Medical and nursing support for continence care is an important resource, but it is unhelpful to create a distinction between what is continence care and what is personal or intimate care. Prompted toileting is an approach that may be particularly beneficial for some residents. Valuing the intimate and personal care work unqualified and junior staff provide to people living with dementia and reinforcement of good practice in ways that are meaningful to this workforce are important clinician-led activities. Providing dementia-sensitive continence care within the daily work routines of care homes is key to helping to reduce and manage FI for this population.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

large number of older people. People living with dementia (PLWD) may be less able to manage their diabetes, putting them at increased risk of complications such as hypoglycaemia. The aim of this review was to identify key mechanisms within different interventions that are likely to improve diabetes outcomes in PLWD.","This is a realist review involving scoping of the literature and stakeholder interviews to develop theoretical explanations of how interventions might work, systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories and their validation with a purposive sample of stakeholders. Twenty-six stakeholders - user\/patient representatives, dementia care providers, clinicians specialising in diabetes or dementia and researchers - took part in interviews, and 24 participated in a consensus conference.","We included 89 papers. Ten focused on PLWD and diabetes, and the remainder related to people with either dementia, diabetes or other long-term conditions. We identified six context-mechanism-outcome configurations which provide an explanatory account of how interventions might work to improve the management of diabetes in PLWD. This includes embedding positive attitudes towards PLWD, person-centred approaches to care planning, developing skills to provide tailored and flexible care, regular contact, family engagement and usability of assistive devices. An overarching contingency emerged concerning the synergy between an intervention strategy, the dementia trajectory and social and environmental factors, especially family involvement.","Evidence highlighted the need for personalised care, continuity and family-centred approaches, although there was limited evidence that this happens routinely. This review suggests there is a need for a flexible service model that prioritises quality of life, independence and patient and carer priorities. Future research on the management of diabetes in older people with complex health needs, including those with dementia, needs to look at how organisational structures and workforce development can be better aligned to their needs.","PROSPERO, CRD42015020625.

Studies not reporting patient outcomes or contributing to the programme theory were excluded.","Phase 1 combined findings from 15 stakeholder interviews and 22 publications to develop candidate programme theories. Phases 2 and 3 identified and synthesised evidence from 28 publications. Prominent context-mechanism-outcome configurations were identified to explain what supported dementia-friendly healthcare in acute settings. Staff capacity to understand the behaviours of people living with dementia as communication of an unmet need, combined with a recognition and valuing of their role in their care, prompted changes to care practices. Endorsement from senior management gave staff confidence and permission to adapt working practices to provide good dementia care. Key contextual factors were the availability of staff and an alignment of ward priorities to value person-centred care approaches. A preoccupation with risk generated responses that werelikely to restrict patient choice and increase their distress.","This review suggests that strategies such as dementia awareness training alone will not improve dementia care or outcomes for patients with dementia. Instead, how staff are supported to implement learning and resources by senior team members with dementia expertise is a key component for improving care practices and patient outcomes.","CRD42015017562."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

dementia. There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

a systematic review, patient and public consultation and consensus recommendations.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1-192"},"ELocationID":"10.3310\/hta21260","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)]. The systematic review protocol is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015027346.","The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment

to review the perceived effectiveness of current interventions.","We undertook a systematic review including all types of research relating to interventions for YOD. We searched PubMed, CINHAL Plus, SCOPUS, EBSCO Host EJS, Social Care Online and Google Scholar, hand-searched journals and carried out lateral searches (July-October 2016).

However, service continuity was compromised by short-term project-based commissioning and ad-hoc service delivery.","The evidence on the experience of living with YOD is not matched by research and the innovation needed to mitigate the impact of YOD.

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of dementia on access to non-dementia services and identify ways of improving service delivery for this population.","Qualitative study involving interviews and focus groups. Thematic content analysis was informed by theories of continuity of care and access to care.","Primary and secondary care in the South and North East of England.","PLWD who had 1 of the following comorbidities-diabetes, stroke, vision impairment, their family carers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the 3 conditions.","We recruited 28 community-dwelling PLWD, 33 family carers and 56 HCPs. Analysis resulted in 3 overarching themes: (1) family carers facilitate access to care and continuity of care, (2) the impact of the severity and presentation of dementia on management of comorbid conditions, (3) communication and collaboration across specialities and services is not dementia aware. We found examples of good practice, but these tended to be about the behaviour of individual practitioners rather than system-based approaches; current systems may unintentionally block access to care for PLWD.","This study suggests that, in order to improve access and continuity for PLWD and comorbidity, a significant change in the organisation of care is required which involves: coproduction of care where professionals, PLWD and family carers work in partnership; recognition of the way a patient's diagnosis of dementia affects the management of other long-term conditions; flexibility in services to ensure they are sensitive to the changing needs of PLWD and their family carers over time; and improved collaboration across specialities and organisations. Research is needed to develop interventions that support partnership working and tailoring of care for PLWD and comorbidity."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The systematic review will be started in May 2016. Studies are excluded that focus on advance decision-making.

poorer access to generalist and specialist palliative care than people with cancer, and experience worse outcomes in terms of pain and symptom control, and quality and experience of care. In the UK, the National Council for Palliative Care (NCPC) ran a national survey of services for end-of-life care for people with dementia (2008) in which 16 services were identified, and reported on case studies and examples of good practice. We updated the NCPC survey to review progress in previously identified services, identify factors that lead to sustainable services and identify new initiatives in this area of care.","An online survey was developed and piloted before use. Initiatives were contacted via targeted (N=63) and open call invitations. The survey was made up of 5 sections. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics.","15 services responded. They engaged in a wide range of activities predominately providing direct care (80%) and workforce development\/advisory or educational activities (87%). Results suggest that sustainability of services is reliant on clinicians with a leadership role and wider system support through funding mechanisms and a minimum level of integration within normal service provision.","Recent initiatives are largely built on the expertise of the nursing profession (with or without input from medical consultants), and driven mainly by the charity and hospice sector. This has generated a potential new model of care provision in end of life dementia care, 'Hospice-enabled Dementia Care'."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Rates of diabetes in people with dementia are between 13 and 20 %. Diabetes management and diabetic self-care may be adversely affected by the presence of dementia. There is a need to know what interventions work best in the management of diabetes in people living with dementia (PLWD) in different settings and at different stages of the dementia trajectory. The overall aim is to develop an explanatory account or programme theory about 'what works' in the management of diabetes in people in what context and to identify promising interventions that merit further evaluation.","This study uses a realist approach including studies on the management of diabetes in older people, medication management, diabetes-related self-care, workforce issues and assessment and treatment. We will use an iterative, stakeholder driven, four-stage approach. Phase 1: development of initial programme theory\/ies through a first scoping of the literature and consultation with key stakeholder groups (user\/patient representatives, dementia-care providers, clinicians, diabetes and dementia researchers and diabetes specialists). Phase 2: systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories identified in phase 1. Phase 3: validation of programme theory\/ies with a purposive sample of participants from phase 1. Phase 4: actionable recommendations for the management of diabetes in PLWD.","A realist synthesis of the evidence will provide a theoretical framework (i.e. an explanation of how interventions work, for whom, in what context and why) for practice and future research work that articulates the barriers and facilitators to effective management of diabetes in people with dementia. By providing possible explanations for the way in which interventions are thought to work and how change is achieved, it will demonstrate how to tailor an intervention to the setting and patient group. The propositions arising from the review will also inform the design of future intervention studies.","PROSPERO registration number CRD42015020625."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. f.bunn@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. c.goodman@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Malone","ForeName":"Jo Rycroft","Initials":"JR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. j.rycroft-malone@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Peter Reece","Initials":"PR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. p.jones@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burton","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. c.burton@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School (Royal Free Campus), Rowland Hill Street, London, UK. g.rait@ucl.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Trivedi","ForeName":"Daksha","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. d.trivedi@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bayer","ForeName":"Antony","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cochrane Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

to hospital is a policy priority. Dementia\u00a0friendly interventions in health care promote inclusion of patients and carers in decision-making and adapt practices and environments to be appropriate to the needs of people with cognitive impairment. While there has been a wealth of activity, the number of studies evaluating interventions is limited, and the majority focuses on reporting staff and organisational outcomes. By focusing on patient and carer outcomes, this review will aim to develop an explanatory account of how and in what circumstances dementia friendly environments in health care work for people living with dementia and with what outcomes.","Realist review is a theory-driven method which seeks to produce explanatory accounts of why interventions work and specifically, what combination of components are most effective in producing particular outcomes. Stakeholder interviews, a review of the literature, and an expert steering group workshop will be used to explore the assumptions behind interventions that are designed to enhance health care for people living with dementia to understand the underlying programme theories. The review will focus on studies that report patient and carer outcomes, including involvement in decision-making, length of stay and referral to long-term care, adverse incidents (e.g. patient distress, delirium falls, nutrition and hydration and infection), antipsychotic medication prescribing, evidence of patient-centred care and patient and carer satisfaction.","The review will provide an explanatory model about how dementia\u00a0friendly interventions in hospital settings improve outcomes for people living with dementia and their family carers and in what circumstances for future

care for older people with dementia in care homes. Findings consistently demonstrate improvements in practitioner confidence and knowledge, but comparisons are either with usual care or not made. This paper draws on findings from three studies to develop a framework for understanding the essential dimensions of end of life care delivery in long-term care settings for people with dementia.","The data from three studies on EoL care in care homes: (i) EVIDEM EoL, (ii) EPOCH, and (iii) TTT EoL were used to inform the development of the framework. All used mixed method designs and two had an intervention designed to improve how care home staff provided end of life care. The EVIDEM EoL and EPOCH studies tracked the care of older people in care homes over a period of 12 months. The TTT study collected resource use data of care home residents for three months, and surveyed decedents' notes for ten months,","Across the three studies, 29 care homes, 528 residents, 205 care home staff, and 44 visiting health care professionals participated. Analysis of showed that end of life interventions for people with dementia were characterised by uncertainty in three key areas; what treatment is the 'right' treatment, who should do what and when, and in which setting EoL care should be delivered and by whom? These uncertainties are conceptualised as Treatment uncertainty, Relational uncertainty and Service uncertainty. This paper proposes an emergent framework to inform the development and evaluation of EoL care interventions in care homes.","For people with dementia living and dying in care homes, EoL interventions need to provide strategies that can accommodate or \"hold\" the inevitable and often unresolvable uncertainties of providing and receiving care in these settings."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

Most models of care focus on single diseases and do not take into account the needs of those with comorbidities and dementia.

The prevalence of FI in residents of care homes is high, but it is not an inevitable consequence of old age or dementia. There is good evidence on risk factors, but few studies provide evidence about effective interventions. There is a need to understand how, why, and in what circumstances particular programmes to reduce and manage FI are effective (or not) for people with dementia. The purpose of this review is to identify which (elements of the) interventions could potentially be effective, and examine the barriers and facilitators to the acceptability, uptake and implementation of interventions designed to address FI in people with dementia who are resident in care homes.","A realist synthesis approach to review the evidence will be used which will include studies on continence, person-centred care, implementation research in care homes, workforce and research on care home culture. An iterative four-stage approach is planned. Phase 1: development of an initial programme theory or theories that will be 'tested' through a first scoping of the literature and consultation with five stakeholder groups (care home providers, user representatives, academics and practice educators, clinicians with a special interest in FI and continence specialists). Phase 2: a systematic search and analysis of published and unpublished evidence to test and develop the programme theories identified in phase 1. Phase 3: validation of programme theory\/ies with a purposive sample of participants from phase 1.","The overall protocol does not require ethical review. The University research ethics committee will review interviews conducted as part of phase 1 and 3. The final fourth phase will synthesise and develop recommendations for practice and develop testable hypotheses for further research."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

with dementia, but relatively little is known about what these roles achieve, or if they are more effective than roles that do not require a clinical qualification. The aim of this review was to synthesise the literature on the scope and effectiveness of specialist nurses, known as Admiral Nurses, and set this evidence in the context of other community-based initiatives to support family carers of people with dementia. We undertook a systematic review of the literature relating to the scope and effectiveness of Admiral Nurses and a review of reviews of interventions to support the family carers of people with dementia. To identify studies, we searched electronic databases, undertook lateral searches and contacted experts. Searches were undertaken in November 2012. Results are reported narratively with key themes relating to Admiral Nurses identified using thematic synthesis. We included 33 items relating to Admiral Nurses (10 classified as research) and 11 reviews evaluating community-based support for carers of people with dementia. There has been little work to evaluate specific interventions provided by Admiral Nurses, but three overarching thematic categories were identified: (i) relational support, (ii) co-ordinating and personalising support and (iii) challenges and threats to the provision of services by Admiral Nurses. There was an absence of clearly articulated goals and service delivery was subject to needs of the host organisation and the local area. The reviews of community-based support for carers of people with dementia included 155 studies but, in general, evidence that interventions reduced caregiver depression or burden was weak, although psychosocial and educational interventions may reduce depression in carers. Community support for carers of people with dementia, such as that provided by Admiral Nurses, is valued by family carers, but the impact of such initiatives is not clearly established.

English-language articles were included if they made any reference to the role of EMS in the urgent or emergency care of OPWD. Preparatory scoping and qualitative work with frontline ambulance and primary care staff and carers of OPWD informed our review question and subsequent synthesis.","Seventeen literature sources were included. Over half were from the grey literature. There was no research that directly addressed the review question. There was evidence in reports, briefings and professional recommendations of EMS addressing some of the issues they face in caring for OPWD. Three roles of EMS could be drawn out of the literature: emergency transport, assess and manage and a 'last resort' or safety net role.","The use of EMS by OPWD is not well understood, although the literature reviewed demonstrated a concern for this group and awareness that services are not optimum. Research in dementia care should consider the role that EMS plays, particularly if considering crises, urgent care responses and transitions between care settings. EMS research into new ways of working, training or extended paramedical roles should consider specific needs and challenges of responding to people with dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The presence of dementia may complicate clinical care for other conditions and undermine a patient's ability to manage a chronic condition. The aim of this study was to scope the extent, range and nature of research activity around dementia and comorbidity.","We undertook a scoping review including all types of research relating to the prevalence of comorbidities in people with dementia; current systems, structures and other issues relating to service organisation and delivery; patient and carer experiences; and the experiences and attitudes of service providers. We searched AMED, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, NHS Evidence, Scopus, Google Scholar (searched 2012, Pubmed updated 2013), checked reference lists and performed citation searches on PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to February 2014).","We included 54 primary studies, eight reviews and three guidelines. Much of the available literature relates to the prevalence of comorbidities in people with dementia or issues around quality of care. Less is known about service organisation and delivery or the views and experiences of people with dementia and their family carers. There is some evidence that people with dementia did not have the same access to treatment and monitoring for conditions such as visual impairment and diabetes as those with similar comorbidities but without dementia.","The prevalence of comorbid conditions in people with dementia is high. Whilst current evidence suggests that people with dementia may have poorer access to services the reasons for this are not clear. There is a need for more research looking at the ways in which having dementia impacts on clinical care for other conditions and how the process of care and different services are adapting to the needs of people with dementia and comorbidity. People with dementia should be included in the debate about the management of comorbidities in older populations and there needs to be greater consideration given to including them in studies that focus on age-related healthcare

two-thirds have limited mental capacity. Despite initiatives to reduce unplanned hospital admissions for this population, little is known about the involvement of emergency services in supporting residents in these settings.","This paper reports on a longitudinal study that tracked the involvement of emergency ambulance personnel in the support of older people with dementia, resident in care homes with no on-site nursing providing personal care only. 133 residents with dementia across 6 care homes in the East of England were tracked for a year. The paper examines the frequency and reasons for emergency ambulance call-outs, outcomes and factors associated with emergency ambulance service use.","56% of residents used ambulance services. Less than half (43%) of all call-outs resulted in an unscheduled admission to hospital. In addition to trauma following a following a fall in the home, results suggest that at least a reasonable proportion of ambulance contacts are for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. An emergency ambulance is not likely to be called for older rather than younger residents or for women more than men. Length of residence does not influence use of emergency ambulance services among older people with dementia. Contact with primary care services and admission route into the care home were both significantly associated with emergency ambulance service use. The odds of using emergency ambulance services for residents admitted from a relative's home were 90% lower than the odds of using emergency ambulance services for residents admitted from their own home.","Emergency service involvement with this vulnerable population merits further examination. Future research on emergency ambulance service use by older people with dementia in care homes, should account for important contextual factors, namely, presence or absence of on-site nursing, GP involvement, and access to residents' family, alongside resident health characteristics."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Amador","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

The approach used to achieve this aim was a Dementia Champion Community of Practice Project, which involved dementia leads in various NHS Trusts.

Despite the recent increase in care home research, residents with dementia are often excluded from studies. Care home research networks have been recommended by the Ministerial Advisory Group on Dementia Research (MAGDR) as a way of increasing research opportunities for residents with dementia. This paper reports on an evaluation of the feasibility and early impact of an initiative to increase care home participation in research.","A two phase, mixed methods approach was used; phase 1 established a baseline of current and recent studies including the National Institute for Health Research portfolio. To explore the experiences of recruiting care homes and research participation, interviews were conducted with researchers working for the Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN) and care home managers. In phase 2, four DeNDRoN area offices recruited care homes to a care home network for their region. The care home networks were separate from the DeNDRoN research network. Diaries were used to document and cost recruitment; DeNDRoN staff were interviewed to understand the barriers, facilitators and impact of the care home networks.","Thirty three current or recent studies were identified as involving care homes as care home specific studies or those which included residents. Further details of care home recruitment were obtained on 20 studies by contacting study teams. Care home managers were keen to be involved in research that provided staff support, benefits for residents and with minimal disruption. In phase 2, 141 care homes were recruited to the care home research networks, through corporate engagement and individual invitation.

dementia affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the disease course and result in distress, increased carer burden, high service utilization and unwanted moves to care homes. Research has focused on long-term settings and has not considered people with dementia living at home and at different stages of the disease trajectory. Our aim is to review systematically the evidence concerning non-pharmacological strategies to minimise behavioural and psychological symptoms in community-dwelling older people with dementia.","Our approach is a two-stage co-design: a systematic mapping of the broad evidence around behavioural and psychological symptoms followed by an in-depth systematic review of studies of non-pharmacological interventions for behavioural and psychological symptoms from the perspective of their impact on community-dwelling older people with dementia and their carers. The review will include published literature involving a wide range of electronic databases using sensitive and comprehensive searches and lateral searching including checking citations.We will produce a descriptive map of the studies by design and by the focus of interventions and apply further inclusion criteria, developed in conjunction with lay experts, to select studies for an in-depth systematic review that will include independent quality assessment and detailed data extraction by two reviewers.The review process will be integrated with stakeholder meetings and a multidisciplinary expert advisory group to guide the review parameters and shape the research questions on the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms in people with dementia. Because studies are likely to be diverse in methodology and interventions, we will conduct a narrative synthesis of the in-depth systematic review. If appropriate, we will pool studies in a meta-analysis. We will explore review findings at both stages through focus groups and interviews with service providers, practitioners, people with dementia and carers.","This integrated review in collaboration with key stakeholders will synthesise research evidence to identify appropriate interventions for effective management of behavioural and psychological symptoms that supports people with dementia living at home and their carers, and which reflects their priorities.

limited life expectancy and the dying trajectory can be protracted and unpredictable. For good end-of-life care, early communication, exploration of residents' wishes, and identification of someone who can represent them, are important. In care homes the timing of these discussions, and who is involved is variable. Person-centred approaches to dementia care assume that people with dementia can actively participate in decisions about their lives. Less well understood is how this can inform end-of-life care decision making and complement information provided in advance care plans completed prior to, or at the point of admission to a care home.","To explore how older people with dementia discuss their priorities and preferences for end-of-life care.","An exploratory, qualitative study that used guided conversations with 18 people with dementia, living in six care homes. Participants were asked about their life in the care home, their health, thoughts for the future, and wishes surrounding end of life. Data were analysed thematically.","People with dementia's accounts of life in the care home, what they valued, and the impact of having dementia on how they participated in decision making, provided key insights into care preferences. Three linked themes that had relevance for thinking and talking about end of life were identified: \"dementia and decision making\", \"everyday relationships\" and \"place and purpose\". Older people with dementia's accounts of everyday experiences of care, key relationships with family and care home staff members and whether they accepted the care home as their home demonstrated what was important for them now and for the future.","For older people living with a diagnosis of dementia, the experience of living and dying in a care home is inextricably linked. End-of-life care planning and decision making by health care professionals, care home staff and family could be enriched by exploring and documenting the preoccupations, key relationships and wishes about everyday care of people with dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This systematic review evaluates the qualitative evidence about how people accommodate and adapt to the diagnosis of dementia and its immediate consequences, to guide practice.","We systematically reviewed qualitative studies exploring experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia, and their carers, around diagnosis and the transition to becoming a person with dementia. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index (all searched in May 2010 with no date restrictions; PubMed search updated in February 2012), checked reference lists, and undertook citation searches in PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to September 2011). We used thematic synthesis to identify key themes, commonalities, barriers to earlier diagnosis, and support identified as helpful. We identified 126 papers reporting 102 studies including a total of 3,095 participants. Three overarching themes emerged from our analysis: (1) pathways through diagnosis, including its impact on identity, roles, and relationships; (2) resolving conflicts to accommodate a diagnosis, including the acceptability of support, focusing on the present or the future, and the use or avoidance of knowledge; and (3) strategies and support to minimise the impact of dementia. Consistent barriers to diagnosis include stigma, normalisation of symptoms, and lack of knowledge. Studies report a lack of specialist support particularly post-diagnosis.","There is an extensive body of qualitative literature on the experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia on receiving and adapting to a diagnosis of dementia. We present a thematic analysis that could be useful to professionals working with people with dementia. We suggest that research emphasis should shift towards the development and evaluation of interventions, particularly those providing support after diagnosis."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for

risk of suboptimal or inappropriate prescribing. To date, research into potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) has not focused on care home residents and\/or has not utilized the recently developed and validated Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria.","The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PIP in older people with dementia living in six residential care homes in England, using the STOPP criteria.","A retrospective analysis was conducted using medication data collected for older people with dementia in six residential care homes in England who participated in the prospective, longitudinal EVIDEM - End of Life (EoL) study. Of the 133 residents recruited to the study, medication administration records were available for and reviewed at two timepoints (approximately 16 weeks apart) for 119 residents and 110 residents, respectively. The prevalence of PIP at these timepoints was determined using 31 of the 65 STOPP criteria applicable when there is no access to residents' medical records.","At the first timepoint, 68 potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) were identified. Fifty-five residents (46.2%) were prescribed one or more PIM(s), eleven (9.2%) were prescribed two or more PIMs and two (1.7%) were prescribed three PIMs. Thirteen of the 31 STOPP criteria utilized in this study (41.9%) were used to identify PIP. Long-term (i.e. >1 month) neuroleptics (antipsychotics) were the most frequently prescribed PIMs (n\u2009=\u200925; 21.0%), followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for >3 months, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at maximum therapeutic dosage for >8 weeks, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in patients with dementia and long-term (i.e. >1 month), long-acting benzodiazepines. At the second timepoint, 57 PIMs were identified; 45 residents (40.9%) were prescribed one or more PIM(s) and 10 (9.1%) were prescribed two or more PIMs, but only one resident (0.9%) was prescribed three PIMs. Of the 31 STOPP criteria utilized in this study, ten (32.3%) were used to identify PIP. Long-term (i.e. >1 month) antipsychotics were again the most frequently prescribed PIMs (n\u2009=\u200921; 19.1%), followed by PPIs at maximum therapeutic dosage for >8 weeks, NSAIDS for >3 months and TCAs in patients with dementia. A significant correlation was found at both timepoints between the number of medicines prescribed and occurrence of PIP.","This study found that over two-fifths of older people with dementia residing in six residential care homes in England were prescribed at least one PIM at each timepoint. Long-term (i.e. >1 month) antipsychotics, NSAID use for >3 months and PPI use at maximum therapeutic dosage for >8 weeks were the most prevalent PIMs. Regular medication review that targets, but is not limited to, these medications is required to reduce PIP in the residential care home setting. The STOPP criteria represent a useful tool to facilitate such review in this patient population."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parsons","ForeName":"Carole","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School

psychotropic medications among older people with dementia living in (residential) care homes.","Medication data were collected at baseline and at two further time-points for eligible residents of six care homes participating in the EVIDEM-End Of Life (EOL) study for whom medication administration records were available. Regular medications were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system and individual sedative loads were calculated using a previously published model.","At baseline, medication administration records were reviewed for 115 residents; medication records were reviewed for 112 and 105 residents at time-points 2 and 3 respectively. Approximately one-third of residents were not taking any medications with sedative properties at each time-point, while a significant proportion of residents had a low sedative load score of 1 or 2 (54.8%, 59.0% and 57.1% at baseline and time-points 2 and 3 respectively). More than 10% of residents had a high sedative load score (\u2265 3) at baseline (12.2%), and this increased to 14.3% at time-points 2 and 3. Approximately two-thirds of residents (66.9%) regularly used one or more psychotropic medication(s). Antidepressants, predominantly selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), were most frequently used, while antipsychotics, hypnotics and anxiolytics were less routinely administered. The prevalence of antipsychotic use among residents was 19.0%, lower than has been previously reported for nursing home residents. Throughout the duration of the study, administration of medications recognised as having prominent sedative adverse effects and\/or containing sedative components outweighed the regular use of primary sedatives.","Sedative load scores were similar throughout the study period for residents with dementia in each of the care homes. Scores were lower than previously reported in studies conducted in long-term care wards which have on-site clinical support. Nevertheless, strategies to optimise drug therapy for care home residents with dementia which rely on clinicians external to the care home for support and medication review are required."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Parsons","ForeName":"Carole","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Pharmacy, Queen's University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast, BT9 7BL, Northern Ireland, UK. c.parsons@qub.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Haydock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mathie","ForeName":"Elspeth","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baron","ForeName":"Natasha","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Machen","ForeName":"Ina","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stevenson","ForeName":"Elizabeth","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Amador","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"100968548","ISSNLinking":"1471-2318"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Hypnotics and Sedatives"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Prescription Drugs"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["drug therapy","epidemiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Hypnotics and Sedatives","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects"]},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"trends"},{"DescriptorName":"Polypharmacy"},{"DescriptorName":"Prescription Drugs","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects"]},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2011","Month":"07","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"30"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21958366","1471-2318-11-56","10.1186\/1471-2318-11-56","PMC3197480"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"BMJ. 2003 Mar 15;326(7389):580","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12637404"}},{"Citation":"Arch Intern Med. 2007 Apr 9;167(7):676-83","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17420426"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2012 Jan;27(1):40-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21370278"}},{"Citation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2007;23(6):395-400","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17396031"}},{"Citation":"Clin Drug Investig. 2010;30(1):63-70","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19995099"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 2006 Apr 1;332(7544):756-61","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16543297"}},{"Citation":"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2009 Apr;64(4):492-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19196642"}},{"Citation":"Arch Intern Med. 2003 Dec 8-22;163(22):2716-24","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14662625"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 2010 Aug;58(8):1459-64","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20579167"}},{"Citation":"Drugs Aging. 2009;26(10):871-81","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19761280"}},{"Citation":"Am J Med. 2009 Dec;122(12):1142-1149.e1-2","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19958893"}},{"Citation":"Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2009 Jul;68(1):97-105","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19660007"}},{"Citation":"Drugs Aging. 2009;26(8):677-86","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19685933"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2004 Mar;16(1):61-74","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15190997"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2009 Dec;24(12):1386-95","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19370714"}},{"Citation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2009 Sep;17(9):726-33","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19700946"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2010 Nov;22(7):1121-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20813074"}},{"Citation":"Am J Geriatr Pharmacother. 2007 Dec;5(4):345-51","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18179993"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 1999 Mar;14(3):213-28;

A staged approach to recruitment was adopted involving separate meetings with staff, residents and relatives. Individual consent was secured with residents with dementia who could consent in the moment and for those without capacity, through mail and follow-up telephone contact with consultees. Data were collected on the frequency of meetings, issues raised by staff, consultees and people with dementia as well as the overall time taken to complete recruitment.","Over five months, 133 older people with dementia were recruited (62% of sampling frame).

Dementia is probably under-diagnosed and under treated with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary care physicians. This problem of under-diagnosis is probably not due to lack of diagnostic skills, but rather to the interaction of case-complexity, pressure on time and the negative effects of reimbursement systems. Primary care physicians often over-estimate the prevalence of dementia syndromes, but in some countries may also overestimate the prevalence of vascular dementia compared with Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosis is a step-wise process which can be aided by use of a cognitive function test, of which there are a number suitable for primary care use. Evidence based practice protocols can enhance detection rates in primary care, and there is growing evidence that communication skills in talking to people with dementia about dementia can be improved. Nevertheless there are multiple obstacles to bringing recognition forward in time, both in public awareness and professional understanding of the early changes in dementia.","There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify population screening in primary care but earlier recognition of people with dementia syndrome is possible within primary care. The diagnosis of dementia is a shared responsibility between generalist and specialist disciplines. Primary care physicians should explore patients' ideas and concerns around their symptoms prior to referral and tentatively discuss possible diagnoses. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the primary care physician should provide both practical and emotional support to allow the patient and their family to come to terms with living with dementia, and refer them for additional psychosocial support if required."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care for Older People, University College London, London, NW3 2PF, UK. s.iliffe@pcps.ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ashley","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"DeNDRoN Primary Care Clinical Studies Group"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MC_U122797163","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Physician-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"66"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19226529","10.1002\/gps.2204"]}}}]}
