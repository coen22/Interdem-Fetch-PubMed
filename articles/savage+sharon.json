The extent of awareness or\u00a0lack of awareness has consequences for well-being of PwD and carers, impacting on rates of hospital admission, institutionalization, mood, adjustment to diagnosis, outcomes from intervention and carer burden. An accurate estimation of a person's awareness could therefore be useful in a clinical setting to support PwD and their carers in making appropriate choices for health and care decisions, and could facilitate safe management by health care professionals, e.g. in an acute care setting. There is a range of different approaches to measuring awareness reported in the dementia research literature, with varying estimates of the frequency of lack of awareness, reflecting different methodologies and populations. The majority of the methods have been developed for research purposes and may not be suitable for clinical use. There are no recent scoping or systematic reviews of the available methods.","We will conduct a scoping review of published studies that have assessed awareness in people with dementia of all types, and all degrees of severity. The systematic search will include the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, using search terms for dementia (\"dement*\" or \"Alzheimer*\" or \"Pick's disease\") and \"awareness\", \"unawareness\", \"anosognosia\", \"insight\", \"denial\", \"metacognit*\" or \"discrepanc*\" identified from pilot searches. Findings will be mapped and described according to the method used, the setting and diagnosis and the object of awareness studied if specified. Validated measures will be identified.","This scoping review will provide an overview of the methods used to measure awareness in people with dementia, allowing comparison of the methods along with identification of validated measures. The methods or components will be appraised for potential clinical use, and gaps in research will be highlighted."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alexander","ForeName":"Catherine M","Initials":"CM","Identifier":"0000-0002-0052-9938","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"REACH: The Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health, College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

progressive aphasia (svPPA) has been attributed to an amodal \"storage\" deficit of the semantic system. Performance consistency has been proposed to be a key characteristic of storage deficits but has not been examined in close detail and larger participant cohorts.","We assessed whether 10 people with svPPA showed consistency in picture naming across 3 closely consecutive sessions. We examined item-by-item consistency of naming accuracy and specific error types, while controlling for the effects of word-related variables such as word frequency, familiarity, and age of acquisition.","Participants were very consistent in their accurate and inaccurate responses over and above any effects of the word-related variables. Analyses of error types that compared consistency of semantic errors, correct responses, and other error types (e.g., phonologically related errors, unrelated errors) revealed lower consistency.","Our findings support the assumption that semantic features constituting semantic representations of objects are progressively lost in people with svPPA and are therefore consistently unavailable during naming. Variability in the production of error types occurs when distinctive features of an object are lost, resulting in the selection of semantically or visually similar items or in the failure to select an item and a response omission. The assessment of performance consistency sheds light on the underlying impairment of people with semantic deficits (semantic storage vs. access deficit). This can support the choice of an appropriate treatment technique to maintain or reteach semantic information.

In this study we compare generalisation and maintenance of learning after COEN with performance achieved using a classical naming therapy (NT). The study recruited a 62-year-old woman with SD. An ABACAB experimental design was implemented, with naming performance assessed at baseline, post- intervention, 3 and 6 weeks after the end of each treatment phase. Three generalisation tasks were also assessed pre- and post-intervention. Naming post-intervention improved significantly following both therapies, however, words trained using COEN therapy showed a significantly greater degree of generalisation than those trained under NT. In addition, only words trained with COEN continued to show significant improvements compared with baseline performance when assessed 6 weeks after practice ceased.

Semantic deficits were evaluated using a naming and semantic knowledge composite score, comprising verbal and non-verbal neuropsychological measures of single-word processing (confrontational naming, comprehension, and semantic association) from the Sydney Language Battery (SYDBAT) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination - Revised (ACE-R). Voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis was conducted using the region of interest approach. In total, 84 participants were recruited from a multidisciplinary research clinic in Sydney. Participants included 17 patients with ALS, 19 with ALS-FTD, 22 with SD and 26 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Significant semantic deficits were observed in ALS and ALS-FTD compared to controls. The severity of semantic deficits varied across the clinical phenotypes: ALS patients were less impaired than ALS-FTD patients, who in turn were not as impaired as SD patients. Anterior temporal lobe atrophy significantly correlated with semantic deficits. In conclusion, semantic impairment is a feature of ALS and ALS-FTD, and reflects the severity of temporal lobe pathology.

Beyond this time, improvements often fade, yet no studies have investigated how to maintain performance. Nine SD patients completed a 2-month word training program and were then monitored over 6 months: firstly for 2 months without training, followed by a further 4 months, where additional training was provided to revise words, if required. All patients improved their naming immediately postintervention (P<0.001). After 2 months without practice, significant declines occurred in 4 patients. To sustain at least 80% of their postintervention performance 6 months later, 4 patients required minimal revision (<10 sessions over the period), 2 required regular weekly or biweekly revision sessions, with the remaining 3 patients requiring no revision sessions. During this period, group results indicated some decline in words that were initially known, but were not trained. Improvements in naming can be sustained in SD patients, with the support of less intense, but ongoing revision. Training words that are still known appears to help prolong memory of these words.

All patient groups displayed some level of impairment, however, specific patterns emerged in each variant. Participants with sv-PPA were the least impaired, showing marginal difficulties exclusively for sentence repetition, whereas those with lv-PPA had the worst overall performance. Cases with nfv-PPA showed compromised repetition of multisyllabic and phonologically similar words. The deficit in cases with AD was confined to span tasks. These distinctive patterns of language impairments can assist in the differential diagnosis of PPA variants and point toward the vulnerability of specific cognitive systems in each syndrome.

We describe the case of a patient with SD who showed greater generalization of learning following a conceptual enrichment therapy than when learning items in a word-retrieval therapy. Our results suggest that enhancing an item's semantic network connections may result in improved generalization of learning in SD.

In this study acoustic measures of speech in conjunction with voxel-based morphometry were used to determine the success of the measures as an adjunct to diagnosis and to explore the neural basis of apraxia of speech in nfvPPA. Forty-one patients (21 lvPPA, 20 nfvPPA) were recruited from a consecutive sample with suspected frontotemporal dementia. Patients were diagnosed using the current gold-standard of expert perceptual judgment, based on presence\/absence of particular speech features during speaking tasks. Seventeen healthy age-matched adults served as controls. MRI scans were available for 11 control and 37 PPA cases; 23 of the PPA cases underwent amyloid ligand PET imaging. Measures, corresponding to perceptual features of apraxia of speech, were periods of silence during reading and relative vowel duration and intensity in polysyllable word repetition. Discriminant function analyses revealed that a measure of relative vowel duration differentiated nfvPPA cases from both control and lvPPA cases (r(2)\u200a= 0.47) with 88% agreement with expert judgment of presence of apraxia of speech in nfvPPA cases. VBM analysis showed that relative vowel duration covaried with grey matter intensity in areas critical for speech motor planning and programming: precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, only affected in the nfvPPA group. This bilateral involvement of frontal speech networks in nfvPPA potentially affects access to compensatory mechanisms involving right hemisphere homologues. Measures of silences during reading also discriminated the PPA and control groups, but did not increase predictive accuracy. Findings suggest that a measure of relative vowel duration from of a polysyllable word repetition task may be sufficient for detecting most cases of apraxia of speech and distinguishing between nfvPPA and lvPPA."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Kirrie J","Initials":"KJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ;

Although FTD patients exhibit prominent deficits in emotion perception and social cognition, these domains have received relatively little attention in ALS. Moreover, direct comparisons between ALS and FTD on emotion processing tasks remain lacking. Twenty-nine patients with ALS (16 with coexisting FTD (FTD-ALS) and 13 without dementia), 25 behavioural variant FTD patients and 30 healthy controls completed neuropsychological and emotion tasks (Ekman Caricatures and the TASIT). Both ALS and FTD patient groups showed significant deficits on the emotion tasks compared to controls. After dividing ALS patients into those with and without FTD, only the patients with coexisting FTD (FTD-ALS) were impaired. FTD-ALS and FTD patient groups displayed similar levels of impairment, even after controlling for measures of general cognition, and demonstrated similar profiles across different types of emotions. We conclude that patients with FTD-ALS and FTD show similar, significant impairments in emotional processing. By contrast, ALS patients without dementia exhibit preserved emotion processing.

Patients with ALS were further subclassified into ALS with cognitive and behavioral symptoms (ALS-plus; n = 8) and those without (ALS; n = 14). By definition, ALS-plus did not reach the diagnostic threshold for ALS-FTD. All patients underwent neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessments, and underwent a brain MRI. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was conducted to establish patterns of brain atrophy.","Cortical atrophy in ALS was linked to neuropsychiatric and cognitive changes (ALS-plus vs ALS). Patients with ALS-plus had significant atrophy across motor and somatosensory as well as adjacent frontal and parietal areas, even after strict multiple comparison correction.

Given these preserved skills, attempts have been made to help re-build vocabulary in SD patients, with promising results. Such reports, however, are generally based upon only one or two cases and have employed variable retraining methods. It is thus unclear which elements of practice are crucial to success. Over two studies, we assessed four patients undergoing a word training program, who ranged in severity from mild to severe impairments to semantic knowledge. All four participants showed significant improvements in their ability to name trained items, with no changes in untrained items over the same time period. Improvements were evident within 3 weeks of practice, and could be established from a simple, repetitive practice of word-picture pairing, carried out at the participant's home. Strong effect sizes of the treatment were found in patients with severe deficits. Maintenance of learning was observed on some follow-up assessments, although continued practice is likely to be needed to sustain naming performance. Incorporating generation tasks into the practice may be assistive, but was not essential to success. These data support the utility of implementing simple home-practice programs even for patients with significant language deficits.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known of the impact of the 3 main clinical variants of FTD- behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SemDem), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)-or the role of disease severity in caregiver burden. The Zarit Burden Inventory was used to measure caregiver burden of bvFTD (n=17), SemDem (n=20), PNFA (n=20), and AD (n=19) patients. Symptom duration, caregiver age, and relationship type were matched across groups. Moreover, a number of caregiver (mood, social network) and patient variables (functional disability, behavioral changes, relationship with caregiver, and dementia stage) were addressed to investigate their impact on caregiver burden. Caregivers of bvFTD patients reported the highest burden, whereas SemDem and PNFA caregivers reported burden similar to AD. A regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden in FTD, regardless of subtype, was explained by a model combining disease staging, relationship changes, and caregiver depression. Burden increased with disease severity in FTD. This study is the first to show that caregivers of SemDem, PNFA, and AD patients show similar burden, while confirming that bvFTD caregivers show higher burden than AD caregivers.

Twenty patients with ALS, 20 bvFTD patients and 20 healthy controls completed a neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment including cognitive screening, working memory, inhibitory control, decision making and emotion recognition. The resulting neuropsychological and behavioural data were analysed by Rasch analysis. ALS patients showed a similar profile to bvFTD patients on tests of working memory, inhibitory control and behavioural measures. Nine ALS patients (45%) had cognitive impairment and five (25%) met criteria for bvFTD. Even in a subset of MND patients with no impairment on the ACE-R, subtle impairment of inhibitory control together with moderate to severe apathy, were found. The Rasch analysis confirmed that all patients could be ranked on the same continuum, based on their neuropsychological performance and behaviour. Thus, the cognitive and behavioural profiles of ALS mirror those seen in bvFTD. Impaired inhibitory control and behavioural changes suggest subtle orbitofrontal dysfunction in ALS.

These findings indicate that a subset of FTD patients may benefit from enhanced emotional intensity that will facilitate facial emotion recognition."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kumfor","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Miller","ForeName":"Laurie","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lah","ForeName":"Suncica","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hsieh","ForeName":"Sharpley","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Savage","ForeName":"Sharon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hodges","ForeName":"John R","Initials":"JR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piguet","ForeName":"Olivier","Initials":"O"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Soc Neurosci","NlmUniqueID":"101279009","ISSNLinking":"1747-0919"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Emotions","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Facial Expression"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Frontotemporal Dementia","QualifierName":["physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Recognition, Psychology","QualifierName":"physiology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"3","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21957889","10.1080\/17470919.2011.620779"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21908392","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"15"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1460-2156","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"134","Issue":"Pt 10","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Brain : a journal of neurology","ISOAbbreviation":"Brain"},"ArticleTitle":"Subtypes of progressive aphasia: application of the International Consensus Criteria and validation using \u03b2-amyloid imaging.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"3030-43"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/brain\/awr216","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Primary progressive aphasia comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative conditions with diverse clinical profiles and underlying pathological substrates. A major development has been the publication of the recent International Consensus Criteria for the three major variants namely: semantic, non-fluent\/agrammatic and logopenic. The logopenic variant is assumed to represent an atypical presentation of Alzheimer pathology although evidence for this is, at present, limited. The semantic and non-fluent\/agrammatic variants are largely associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 and tau pathology, respectively. The applicability of the International Consensus Criteria to an unselected clinical sample is unknown and no agreed clinical evaluation scale on which to derive the diagnosis exists. We assessed 47 consecutive cases of primary progressive aphasic seen over a 3-year period in a specialist centre, using a newly developed progressive aphasia language scale. A subgroup of 30 cases underwent (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography imaging, a putative biomarker of Alzheimer's disease that detects \u03b2-amyloid accumulation, and they were compared with an age-matched group (n = 10) with typical, predominately amnestic Alzheimer's disease. The application of an algorithm based on four key speech and language variables (motor speech disorders, agrammatism, single-word comprehension and sentence repetition) classified 45 of 47 (96%) of patients and showed high concordance with the gold standard expert clinical diagnosis based on the International Consensus Criteria. The level of neocortical \u03b2-amyloid burden varied considerably across aphasic variants. Of 13 logopenic patients, 12 (92%) had positive \u03b2-amyloid uptake. In contrast, one of nine (11%) semantic variant and two of eight (25%) non-fluent\/agrammatic cases were positive. The distribution of \u03b2-amyloid across cortical regions of interest was identical in cases with the logopenic variant to that of patients with typical Alzheimer's disease although the total load was lower in the aphasic cases. Impairments of sentence repetition and sentence comprehension were positively correlated with neocortical burden of \u03b2-amyloid, whereas impaired single-word comprehension showed a negative correlation. The International Consensus Criteria can be applied to the majority of cases with primary progressive aphasic using a simple speech and language assessment scale based upon four key variables. \u03b2-amyloid imaging confirms the higher rate of Alzheimer pathology in the logopenic variant and, in turn, the low rates in the other two variants. The study offers insight into the biological basis of clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, which appear topographically independent of \u03b2-amyloid load."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leyton","ForeName":"Cristian E","Initials":"CE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neuroscience Research Australia, Randwick, NSW, 2031, Sydney, Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Villemagne","ForeName":"Victor L","Initials":"VL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Savage","ForeName":"Sharon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pike","ForeName":"Kerryn E","Initials":"KE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Kirrie J","Initials":"KJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piguet","ForeName":"Olivier","Initials":"O"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burrell","ForeName":"James R","Initials":"JR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rowe","ForeName":"Christopher C","Initials":"CC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hodges","ForeName":"John R","Initials":"JR"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Brain","NlmUniqueID":"0372537","ISSNLinking":"0006-8950"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Amyloid beta-Peptides"}},"CitationSubset":["AIM","IM"],"CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Brain. 2011 Oct;134(Pt 10):2798-9","PMID":"21900208"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","metabolism"]},{"DescriptorName":"Amyloid beta-Peptides","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Aphasia","QualifierName":["classification","diagnostic imaging","metabolism"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","metabolism"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Language Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Positron-Emission Tomography"},{"DescriptorName":"Speech"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21908392","awr216","10.1093\/brain\/awr216"]}}}]}
