The factors leading to the timing of the decision remain particularly unclear. This systematic review of existing literature aims to gain an understanding of the decision-making timing and process to distinguish the drivers of these decisions, and to identify if there is an \"optimal\" or best time (if any) for a person with dementia to move to a care home.","Six English language electronic databases were searched up to the end of 2016, along with included papers' reference lists. Papers were screened against the inclusion criteria and rated for quality. Extracted data were thematically analyzed.","The review identified 16 relevant papers. Seven themes were identified: (1) what happened before the move; (2) planning for the move, (3) weighing up the decision, (4) lack of support, (5) drivers of the decision, (6) emotional significance of the move, and (7) continued reflection on the decision. \"Time\" of the move was largely absent from much of the literature, although inferences were made. Overall, the decision-making process appeared to be cyclic, with family carers constantly re-evaluating when might be the time to make the move with some continuing to reflect on this even subsequently.","Further research is required to understand the \"optimal\" or best time (if any) for when a person with dementia moves to a care home, and how to determine when someone is ready to

Two thirds of people with dementia live at home and policies in many countries seek to support more people for longer in this setting. Incontinence both contributes to carer burden and is also a significant factor in the decision to move into care homes. A review was conducted for evidence of effectiveness for conservative interventions, which are non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions, for the prevention or management of incontinence in community dwelling people with dementia.","Fourteen electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (from inception to 2012). Assessments of risk of bias were made. Meta-analysis was inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measurements. A narrative analysis was undertaken.","From 427 identified abstracts, 56 studies were examined but only three met the inclusion criteria, all more than a decade old. All three focused on urinary incontinence. Two studies were exploratory or pilot studies. All had a control arm. The interventions were of advice for the carer to implement. Two included toileting education of prompted voiding or an individualised toileting schedule. There was insufficient evidence to support or rule out effectiveness of any of these interventions. Some interventions were unacceptable for some carers. None specifically reported the perspective of the person with dementia.","There was insufficient evidence from any studies to recommend any strategies.

Managing incontinence adds to carer burden and has been reported by family carers as more difficult to manage than behavioural symptoms. Active management strategies have been reported to be associated with less carer depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate carers' perceptions of the range of incontinence problems they helped their relative with and the strategies they employed to manage these.","Family carers of people with dementia living in their own homes were recruited through primary care, specialist community mental health services and voluntary organisations. Qualitative semi structured interviews were conducted either face to face or by telephone and thematically analysed.","Thirty two carers were interviewed. They described a range of problems from supporting the person to remain independent in toileting, through to dealing with inappropriate behaviours, to containing and managing incontinence. All carers actively used problem solving strategies but sometimes these were not acceptable or understood by the person with dementia, particularly as the dementia progressed. Most carers reported protecting the person's dignity by not seeking health professionals help often until the point of a crisis. Once the carer has decided to seek help the responses from health professionals can be less than helpful, and carers report local health service policies on access to continence products to be inconsistent and often inappropriate to their circumstances. A few carers reported strategies for managing toileting and incontinence that have the potential for distress and harm to the person with dementia.","Primary care professionals could be more proactive in enquiry, repeated over time, about toileting and incontinence problems and in giving advice and information to reduce crisis and problems."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Drennan","ForeName":"Vari M","Initials":"VM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health & Social Care Sciences, Kingston University, UK. v.drennan@sgul.kingston.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cole","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1005","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"100968548","ISSNLinking":"1471-2318"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["psychology","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Fecal Incontinence","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Stigma"},{"DescriptorName":"Taboo","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"},{"DescriptorName":"Urinary Incontinence","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2011","Month":"06","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22081876","1471-2318-11-75","10.1186\/1471-2318-11-75","PMC3250935"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Lancet. 2005 Dec 17;366(9503):2112-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16360788"}},{"Citation":"Lancet Neurol. 2008 Sep;7(9):812-26","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18667359"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 1994 Feb;42(2):208-12","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8126338"}},{"Citation":"Neurourol Urodyn. 2010;29(1):165-78","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20025027"}},{"Citation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2008;26(1):65-78","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18617737"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 1998 Oct;13(10):682-90","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9818303"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 2007 Dec;164(12 Suppl):5-56","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18340692"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2003 Jun;42(6):607-16","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12787234"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 1999 Apr;39(2):177-85","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10224714"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimers Dement. 2007 Apr;3(2):81-91","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19595921"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2008 May;23(5):546-51","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18232054"}},{"Citation":"Age Ageing. 2005 May;34(3):242-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15863409"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 2001 Jun;49(6):710-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11454108"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"20925707","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"01","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"09","Day":"22"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1748-3743","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"5","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"International journal of older people nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Older People Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia, dignity and quality of life: nursing practice and its dilemmas.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"235-44"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/j.1748-3743.2010.00231.x","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The need for healthcare practitioners to respect the dignity of older people is widely recognised in England, where it has been given attention by politicians, professionals and health service regulators.
