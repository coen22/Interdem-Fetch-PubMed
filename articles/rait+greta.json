Acting as a caregiver can make it difficult to access sources of support, particularly in the later stages of dementia. This paper reports the development and presents the targets (subject areas) and components of a prototype website to support family caregivers of a person with dementia towards the end of life.","Adopting an iterative approach and co-production methods the development process consisted of four stages: Stage1-Synthesis of data: three sources of data (interviews, systematic review and theory) were synthesised using tabulation, to identify the targets of the prototype; Stage2-Identifying intervention targets and components: a research development group (health practitioners, a family caregiver and academic experts) met to discuss the development, using a modified nominal group process, refining the synthesis from stage 1; Stage3-Developing the intervention prototype: an outline of the prototype was developed based on stage 1 and 2; and Stage4-User testing: interviews with caregivers testing the prototype website.","Qualitative interviews with caregivers identified four targets for the intervention: 1) feeling prepared and equipped; 2) feeling connected and supported; 3) valuing themselves as a caregiver and as an individual; 4) maintaining control of the caring situation and being the coordinator of care. The systematic review provided evidence on how and what components could address these targets, including providing information, peer support, contact with professionals, and psychological support. Theory helped to narrow the focus within each of these targets. Active discussion with the research development group and end users provided an outline of the prototype website. The prototype website presented addresses these targets with written information, videos from other caregivers, and peer and professional support sections. The subject areas covered included expectations at the end of life, support with day-to-day caring, care planning, and communication.","This paper provides a detailed account of the development process of a prototype website for caregiver support. The transparent methodology and key lessons learnt from developing the prototype should help those who are developing similar interventions, across complex, progressive conditions and not just limited to dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Nathan","Initials":"N","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7757-5353","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre

caregivers when providing care for someone with dementia or for use by people with dementia themselves. Decision aids may be videos, booklets, or web-based tools that explicitly state the decision, provide information about the decision, and summarize options along with associated benefits and harms. This helps guide the decision maker through clarifying the values they place on the benefits or harms of the options.","We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature in electronic databases (CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO) in March 2018. Reference lists were searched for relevant papers and citations tracked. Data were synthesized with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Papers were included if they met the following criteria: 1) the focus of the paper was on the evaluation of a decision aid; 2) the decision aid was used in dementia care; and 3) the decision aid was aimed at professionals, people with dementia, or caregivers.","We identified 3618 studies, and 10 studies were included, covering three topics across six decision aids: 1) support with eating\/feeding options, 2) place of care, and 3) goals of care. The mode of delivery and format of the decision aids varied and included paper-based, video-based, and audio-based decision aids. The decision aids were shown to be effective, increasing knowledge and the quality of communication. The meta-analysis demonstrated that decisions are effective in reducing decisional conflict among caregivers (standardized mean difference = -0.50, 95% confidence interval [ - 0.97, - 0.02]).","Decision aids offer a promising approach for providing support for decision-making in dementia care. People are often faced with more than one decision, and decisions are often interrelated. The decision aids identified in this review focus on single topics. There is a need for decision aids that cover multiple topics in one aid to reflect this complexity and better support caregivers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Nathan","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for Ageing Population Studies, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Palliative Care Research, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schiowitz","ForeName":"Brooke","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Ageing Population Studies, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Priment Clinical Trials Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vickerstaff","ForeName":"Victoria","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Palliative Care Research, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sampson","ForeName":"Elizabeth L","Initials":"EL","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia Palliative Care Research, Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust Liaison Team, North Middlesex University Hospital, Sterling Way, London, UK."}]}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"MCCC-FCO-11-U","Acronym":"MCCC_","Agency":"Marie Curie","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"PB-PG-0317-20019","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"RP-PG-1016-20001","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2019 Oct;31(10):1383-1385","PMID":"31657296"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Support Techniques"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Participation"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","decision aid","decision support tool","decision-making"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"4","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31347482","S1041610219000826","10.1017\/S1041610219000826"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30623507","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"06","Day":"01"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"06","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1365-2524","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"07"}},"Title":"Health & social care in the community","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Soc Care Community"},"ArticleTitle":"A \"separation of worlds\": The support and social networks of family carers of people with dementia at the end of life, and the possible role of the internet.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e223-e232"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/hsc.12701","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Caring for someone with dementia is one of the most challenging caring roles; however, the demands of the role towards the end of life often mean carers are unable to maintain face-to-face support. The aim of this study was to: (a) Explore the experiences of older (over 65\u00a0years) family carers of people with dementia of support towards the end of life; (b) Explore with family carers the role of the internet as a support for them at the end of life. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, with purposive sampling from general practice and research networks to recruit 20 current and former family carers aged 65 and over in England (2016-2017). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. An overarching theme of the \"separation of worlds\" (the internal caring world and the outside world of society) was identified, with four sub themes: (a) the support role of relationships and social networks; (b) loss as a consequence of caring; (c) reconstruction of life as a carer; and finally; (d) life within and beyond the computer screen. This study demonstrates the complexity of social support at the end of life for family carers depicted in a model of two worlds. The internet can be seen as a viable approach to help carers maintain existing networks, reconstruct networks they have lost or developing new networks to meet their new needs and circumstances as a carer. Future support interventions should focus on a mixed model of technology and human interaction.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons

Review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e216"},"ELocationID":"10.2196\/jmir.9548","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Caring for someone with dementia is one of the most challenging caring roles. The need for support for family caregivers has been recognized for some time but is often still lacking. With an aging population, demand on health and social care services is growing, and the population is increasingly looking to the internet for information and support.","In this review, we aimed to (1) identify the key components of existing internet-based interventions designed to support family caregivers of people with dementia, (2) develop an understanding of which components are most valued by caregivers, and (3) consider the evidence of effectiveness of internet-based interventions designed to support family caregivers of people with dementia.","We conducted a systematic search of online databases in April 2018. We searched reference lists and tracked citations. All study designs were included. We adopted a narrative synthesis approach with thematic analysis and tabulation as tools.","We identified 2325 studies, of which we included 40. The interventions varied in the number and types of components, duration and dose, and outcomes used to measure effectiveness. The interventions focused on (1) contact with health or social care providers, (2) peer interaction, (3) provision of information, (4) decision support, and (5) psychological support. The overall quality of the studies was low, making interpretation and generalizability of the effectiveness findings difficult. However, most studies suggested that interventions may be beneficial to family caregiver well-being, including positive impacts on depression, anxiety, and burden. Particular benefit came from psychological support provided online, where several small randomized controlled trials suggested improvements in caregiver mental health. Provision of information online was most beneficial when tailored specifically for the individual and used as part of a multicomponent intervention. Peer support provided in online groups was appreciated by most participants and showed positive effects on stress. Finally, online contact with a professional was appreciated by caregivers, who valued easy access to personalized practical advice and emotional support, leading to a reduction in burden and strain.","Although mixed, the results indicate a positive response for the use of internet-based interventions by caregivers. More high-quality studies are required to identify the effectiveness of internet interventions aimed at supporting family caregivers, with particular focus on meeting the needs of caregivers during the different stages of dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9Jenny Hopwood, Nina Walker, Lorraine McDonagh, Greta Rait, Kate Walters, Stephen Iliffe, Jamie Ross, Nathan Davies.

review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1-140"},"ELocationID":"10.3310\/hta21750","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Dementia and diabetes mellitus are common long-term conditions that coexist in a large number of older people. People living with dementia and diabetes may be at increased risk of complications such as hypoglycaemic episodes because they are less able to manage their diabetes.","To identify the key features or mechanisms of programmes that aim to improve the management of diabetes in people with dementia and to identify areas needing further research.","Realist review, using an iterative, stakeholder-driven, four-stage approach. This involved scoping the literature and conducting stakeholder interviews to develop initial programme theories, systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories, and the validation of programme theories with a purposive sample of stakeholders.","Twenty-six stakeholders (user\/patient representatives, dementia care providers, clinicians specialising in dementia or diabetes and researchers) took part in interviews and 24 participated in a consensus conference.","The following databases were searched from 1990 to March 2016: MEDLINE (PubMed), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, The Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, AgeInfo (Centre for Policy on Ageing - UK), Social Care Online, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) portfolio database, NHS Evidence, Google (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) and Google Scholar (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA).","We included 89 papers. Ten papers focused directly on people living with dementia and diabetes, and the rest related to people with dementia or diabetes or other long-term conditions. We identified six context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations that provide an explanatory account of how interventions might work to improve the management of diabetes in people living with dementia. This includes embedding positive attitudes towards people living with dementia, person-centred approaches to care planning, developing skills to provide tailored and flexible care, regular contact, family engagement and usability of assistive devices. A general metamechanism that emerges concerns the synergy between an intervention strategy, the dementia trajectory and social and environmental factors, especially family involvement. A flexible service model for people with dementia and diabetes would enable this synergy in a way that would lead to the improved management of diabetes in people living with dementia.","There is little evidence relating to the management of diabetes in people living with dementia, although including a wider literature provided opportunities for transferable learning. The outcomes in our CMOs are largely experiential rather than clinical. This reflects the evidence available. Outcomes such as increased engagement in self-management are potential surrogates for better clinical management of diabetes, but this is not proven.","This review suggests that there is a need to prioritise quality of life, independence and patient and carer priorities over a more biomedical, target-driven approach. Much current research, particularly that specific to people living with dementia and diabetes, identifies deficiencies in, and problems with, current systems. Although we have highlighted the need for personalised care, continuity and family-centred approaches, there is much evidence to suggest that this is not currently happening. Future research on the management of diabetes in older people with complex health needs, including those with dementia, needs to look at how organisational structures and workforce development can be better aligned to the needs of people living with dementia and diabetes.","This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015020625.","The NIHR HTA programme."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Peter Reece","Initials":"PR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Russell","ForeName":"Bridget","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Trivedi","ForeName":"Daksha","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sinclair","ForeName":"Alan","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Foundation for Diabetes Research in Older People, Diabetes Frail Ltd, Luton, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bayer","ForeName":"Antony","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cochrane Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London Medical School, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rycroft-Malone","ForeName":"Jo","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burton","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"HTA\/13\/138\/03","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Review","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Technol Assess","NlmUniqueID":"9706284","ISSNLinking":"1366-5278"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["education","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Consensus"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Diabetes Mellitus","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"12","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29235986","10.3310\/hta21750","PMC5742454"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28750628","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-7015","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"28"}},"Title":"BMC medicine","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Med"},"ArticleTitle":"What works for whom in the management of diabetes in people living with dementia: a realist review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"141"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12916-017-0909-2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Dementia and diabetes mellitus are common long-term conditions and co-exist in a large number of older people. People living with dementia (PLWD) may be less able to manage their diabetes, putting them at increased risk of complications such as hypoglycaemia. The aim of this review was to identify key mechanisms within different interventions that are likely to improve diabetes outcomes in PLWD.","This is a realist review involving scoping of the literature and stakeholder interviews to develop theoretical explanations of how interventions might work, systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories and their validation with a purposive sample of stakeholders. Twenty-six stakeholders - user\/patient representatives, dementia care providers, clinicians specialising in diabetes or dementia and researchers - took part in interviews, and 24 participated in a consensus conference.","We included 89 papers. Ten focused on PLWD and diabetes, and the remainder related to people with either dementia, diabetes or other long-term conditions. We identified six context-mechanism-outcome configurations which provide an explanatory account of how interventions might work to improve the management of diabetes in PLWD. This includes embedding positive attitudes towards PLWD, person-centred approaches to care planning, developing skills to provide tailored and flexible care, regular contact, family engagement and usability of assistive devices. An overarching contingency emerged concerning the synergy between an intervention strategy, the dementia trajectory and social and environmental factors, especially family involvement.","Evidence highlighted the need for personalised care, continuity and family-centred approaches, although there was limited evidence that this happens routinely. This review suggests there is a need for a flexible service model that prioritises quality of life, independence and patient and carer priorities. Future research on the management of diabetes in older people with complex health needs, including those with dementia, needs to look at how organisational structures and workforce development can be better aligned to their needs.","PROSPERO, CRD42015020625.

from making informed plans about their future and accessing services. Many countries have a policy to increase timely diagnosis, but trials aimed at changing general practitioner (GP) practice have been unsuccessful. We aimed to assess whether a GP's personal letter, with an evidence-based leaflet about overcoming barriers to accessing help for memory problems-aimed at empowering patients and families-increases timely dementia diagnosis and patient presentation to general practice.","Multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial with raters masked to an online computer-generated randomisation system assessing 1 y outcome. We recruited 22 general practices (August 2013-September 2014) and 13 corresponding secondary care memory services in London, Hertfordshire, and Essex, United Kingdom. Eligible patients were aged \u226570 y, without a known diagnosis of dementia, living in their own homes. There were 6,387 such patients in 11 intervention practices and 8,171 in the control practices. The primary outcome was cognitive severity on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Main secondary outcomes were proportion of patients consulting their GP with suspected memory disorders and proportion of those referred to memory clinics. There was no between-group difference in cognitive severity at diagnosis (99 intervention, mean MMSE = 22.04, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 20.95 to 23.13; 124 control, mean MMSE = 22.59, 95% CI = 21.58 to 23.6; p = 0.48). GP consultations with patients with suspected memory disorders increased in intervention versus control group (odds ratio = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.28, 1.54). There was no between-group difference in the proportions of patients referred to memory clinics (166, 2.5%; 220, 2.7%; p = .077 respectively). The study was limited as we do not know whether the additional patients presenting to GPs had objective as well as subjective memory problems and therefore should have been referred. In addition, we aimed to empower patients but did not do anything to change GP practice.","Our intervention to access timely dementia diagnosis resulted in more patients presenting to GPs with memory problems, but no diagnoses increase. We are uncertain as to the reason for this and do not know whether empowering the public and targeting GPs would have resulted in a successful intervention.

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of dementia on access to non-dementia services and identify ways of improving service delivery for this population.","Qualitative study involving interviews and focus groups. Thematic content analysis was informed by theories of continuity of care and access to care.","Primary and secondary care in the South and North East of England.","PLWD who had 1 of the following comorbidities-diabetes, stroke, vision impairment, their family carers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the 3 conditions.","We recruited 28 community-dwelling PLWD, 33 family carers and 56 HCPs. Analysis resulted in 3 overarching themes: (1) family carers facilitate access to care and continuity of care, (2) the impact of the severity and presentation of dementia on management of comorbid conditions, (3) communication and collaboration across specialities and services is not dementia aware. We found examples of good practice, but these tended to be about the behaviour of individual practitioners rather than system-based approaches; current systems may unintentionally block access to care for PLWD.","This study suggests that, in order to improve access and continuity for PLWD and comorbidity, a significant change in the organisation of care is required which involves: coproduction of care where professionals, PLWD and family carers work in partnership; recognition of the way a patient's diagnosis of dementia affects the management of other long-term conditions; flexibility in services to ensure they are sensitive to the changing needs of PLWD and their family carers over time; and improved collaboration across specialities and organisations. Research is needed to develop interventions that support partnership working and tailoring of care for PLWD and comorbidity."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Rates of diabetes in people with dementia are between 13 and 20 %. Diabetes management and diabetic self-care may be adversely affected by the presence of dementia. There is a need to know what interventions work best in the management of diabetes in people living with dementia (PLWD) in different settings and at different stages of the dementia trajectory. The overall aim is to develop an explanatory account or programme theory about 'what works' in the management of diabetes in people in what context and to identify promising interventions that merit further evaluation.","This study uses a realist approach including studies on the management of diabetes in older people, medication management, diabetes-related self-care, workforce issues and assessment and treatment. We will use an iterative, stakeholder driven, four-stage approach. Phase 1: development of initial programme theory\/ies through a first scoping of the literature and consultation with key stakeholder groups (user\/patient representatives, dementia-care providers, clinicians, diabetes and dementia researchers and diabetes specialists). Phase 2: systematic searches of the evidence to test and develop the theories identified in phase 1. Phase 3: validation of programme theory\/ies with a purposive sample of participants from phase 1. Phase 4: actionable recommendations for the management of diabetes in PLWD.","A realist synthesis of the evidence will provide a theoretical framework (i.e. an explanation of how interventions work, for whom, in what context and why) for practice and future research work that articulates the barriers and facilitators to effective management of diabetes in people with dementia. By providing possible explanations for the way in which interventions are thought to work and how change is achieved, it will demonstrate how to tailor an intervention to the setting and patient group. The propositions arising from the review will also inform the design of future intervention studies.","PROSPERO registration number CRD42015020625."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bunn","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. f.bunn@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. c.goodman@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Malone","ForeName":"Jo Rycroft","Initials":"JR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. j.rycroft-malone@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Peter Reece","Initials":"PR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. p.jones@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burton","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK. c.burton@bangor.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School (Royal Free Campus), Rowland Hill Street, London, UK. g.rait@ucl.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Trivedi","ForeName":"Daksha","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. d.trivedi@herts.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bayer","ForeName":"Antony","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cochrane Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.

generation. In societal approaches to the mitigation of major disease 'burden', population screening can sometimes provide an effective approach to improving detection of disease and outcomes. However the acceptability of a systematic population screening programme for dementia, to the British public, is not known.","A Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) event was organised to give members of the public from the East of England an opportunity to offer their perspectives and to comment on the findings of a systematic literature review looking at attitudes and preferences towards screening for dementia. The event was attended by 36 members of the public and eight national Alzheimer's Society Research Network volunteers. The morning discussion contained a presentation, which defined population screening for attendees but contained no reference to the findings of the review. In the afternoon, findings of the review were presented and a discussion on the results was facilitated. The discussions were recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. The NVivo qualitative data software was used to facilitate this process.","A total of 23 key themes emerged in relation to the carer and general population. The most frequent themes which emerged were the low levels of understanding and awareness around the dementia syndrome; the acceptability and validity of any tests; costs to the National Health Service (NHS); an individual's existing health status existing health status; financial\/profit motive for screening; the inability to change prognosis; and the importance and availability of support.","Factors such as personal beliefs, experiences and attitudes to health impact on decisions to be screened for dementia. A number of additional concerns were raised which were not previously identified in the systematic literature review. These were around the economic incentives for screening (profit motive), the provision of social support, and the economic\/social impacts of screening programmes. This may reflect cultural differences in health and social care funding models between Britain and other countries where previous research was conducted."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Martin","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sm987@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fleming","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. jane.fleming@phpc.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cullum","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Academic Unit of Psychiatry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. sarah.cullum@nhs.net."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK. tom.dening@nottingham.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School, UCL, London, UK. g.rait@ucl.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fox","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwich, UK Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.

Yet the potential benefits, harms or acceptability of such a large-scale intervention are not well understood. This research aims to examine the attitudes and preferences of the general public, health care professionals, people with dementia and their carers towards population screening for dementia.","A systematic review of the international literature was undertaken. A search of fifteen bibliographic databases was conducted (up to 12 July 2012; no language restriction) using terms related to dementia, screening, specific screening tools, case finding, and attitudes and preferences; genetic screening and biomarkers were excluded. All study designs were included except opinion-based papers. Included papers were doubly quality assessed and thematically analysed using NVivo.","29,910 papers were identified of which 29 met the inclusion criteria. We identified seventeen themes relating to the 3 phases of the screening process (pre-, in- and post-screen) - none emerged as more of a facilitator than a barrier to the acceptance of dementia screening. Seven themes emerged in relation to the patient, carer and general population: existing health state; lifestyle and life view; awareness of dementia; role of clinician; communication; benefit; and role of the family. Ten themes emerged in relation to the clinician and healthcare professional: patient's existing health and comorbidities; awareness of dementia; confidence; duration of patient contact; suitability of screening tool; cost; disclosure; time; treatment and prognosis; and stigma.","As for all screening programmes, screening for dementia raises complex issues around preference and choice for clinicians and the public, and it is unclear what specific factors promote or reduce screening acceptance the most. Overall, the level of evidence is low, few large scale studies have been undertaken and none were conducted in representative samples, all affecting the generalizability of identified themes across healthcare contexts. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that population screening for dementia may not be acceptable to either the general public or health care professionals, and highlight where focused efforts are needed to gain insights into dementia specific issues."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Martin","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sm987@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kelly","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sak65@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Khan","ForeName":"Ayesha","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Cambridge Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. ak739@medschl.cam.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cullum","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Academic Unit of Psychiatry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. sarah.cullum@nhs.net."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.

comorbid medical conditions and related complaints. The presence of dementia may complicate clinical care for other conditions and undermine a patient's ability to manage a chronic condition. The aim of this study was to scope the extent, range and nature of research activity around dementia and comorbidity.","We undertook a scoping review including all types of research relating to the prevalence of comorbidities in people with dementia; current systems, structures and other issues relating to service organisation and delivery; patient and carer experiences; and the experiences and attitudes of service providers. We searched AMED, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, NHS Evidence, Scopus, Google Scholar (searched 2012, Pubmed updated 2013), checked reference lists and performed citation searches on PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to February 2014).","We included 54 primary studies, eight reviews and three guidelines. Much of the available literature relates to the prevalence of comorbidities in people with dementia or issues around quality of care. Less is known about service organisation and delivery or the views and experiences of people with dementia and their family carers. There is some evidence that people with dementia did not have the same access to treatment and monitoring for conditions such as visual impairment and diabetes as those with similar comorbidities but without dementia.","The prevalence of comorbid conditions in people with dementia is high. Whilst current evidence suggests that people with dementia may have poorer access to services the reasons for this are not clear. There is a need for more research looking at the ways in which having dementia impacts on clinical care for other conditions and how the process of care and different services are adapting to the needs of people with dementia and comorbidity. People with dementia should be included in the debate about the management of comorbidities in older populations and there needs to be greater consideration given to including them in studies that focus on age-related healthcare

burdensome diseases. Incontinence in people with dementia is distressing, adds to carer burden, and influences decisions to relocate people to care homes. Successful and safe management of incontinence in people with dementia presents additional challenges. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of first diagnosis in primary care of urinary and faecal incontinence among people aged 60-89 with dementia, and the use of medication or indwelling catheters for urinary incontinence.","We extracted data on 54,816 people aged 60-89 with dementia and an age-gender stratified sample of 205,795 people without dementia from 2001 to 2010 from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a United Kingdom primary care database. THIN includes data on patients and primary care consultations but does not identify care home residents. Rate ratios were adjusted for age, sex, and co-morbidity using multilevel Poisson regression. The rates of first diagnosis per 1,000 person-years at risk (95% confidence interval) for urinary incontinence in the dementia cohort, among men and women, respectively, were 42.3 (40.9-43.8) and 33.5 (32.6-34.5). In the non-dementia cohort, the rates were 19.8 (19.4-20.3) and 18.6 (18.2-18.9). The rates of first diagnosis for faecal incontinence in the dementia cohort were 11.1 (10.4-11.9) and 10.1 (9.6-10.6). In the non-dementia cohort, the rates were 3.1 (2.9-3.3) and 3.6 (3.5-3.8). The adjusted rate ratio for first diagnosis of urinary incontinence was 3.2 (2.7-3.7) in men and 2.7 (2.3-3.2) in women, and for faecal incontinence was 6.0 (5.1-7.0) in men and 4.5 (3.8-5.2) in women. The adjusted rate ratio for pharmacological treatment of urinary incontinence was 2.2 (1.4-3.7) for both genders, and for indwelling urinary catheters was 1.6 (1.3-1.9) in men and 2.3 (1.9-2.8) in women.","Compared with those without a dementia diagnosis, those with a dementia diagnosis have approximately three times the rate of diagnosis of urinary incontinence, and more than four times the rate of faecal incontinence, in UK primary care. The clinical management of urinary incontinence in people with dementia with medication and particularly the increased use of catheters is concerning and requires further investigation.

numbers of people with the condition. Two thirds of people with dementia live at home and policies in many countries seek to support more people for longer in this setting. Incontinence both contributes to carer burden and is also a significant factor in the decision to move into care homes. A review was conducted for evidence of effectiveness for conservative interventions, which are non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions, for the prevention or management of incontinence in community dwelling people with dementia.","Fourteen electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (from inception to 2012). Assessments of risk of bias were made. Meta-analysis was inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measurements. A narrative analysis was undertaken.","From 427 identified abstracts, 56 studies were examined but only three met the inclusion criteria, all more than a decade old. All three focused on urinary incontinence. Two studies were exploratory or pilot studies. All had a control arm. The interventions were of advice for the carer to implement. Two included toileting education of prompted voiding or an individualised toileting schedule. There was insufficient evidence to support or rule out effectiveness of any of these interventions. Some interventions were unacceptable for some carers. None specifically reported the perspective of the person with dementia.","There was insufficient evidence from any studies to recommend any strategies. There remains an urgent need for both research and also clinical guidance for health professionals tailored to community settings where the majority of people with dementia live."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Drennan","ForeName":"Vari M","Initials":"VM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of

This systematic review evaluates the qualitative evidence about how people accommodate and adapt to the diagnosis of dementia and its immediate consequences, to guide practice.","We systematically reviewed qualitative studies exploring experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia, and their carers, around diagnosis and the transition to becoming a person with dementia. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index (all searched in May 2010 with no date restrictions; PubMed search updated in February 2012), checked reference lists, and undertook citation searches in PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to September 2011). We used thematic synthesis to identify key themes, commonalities, barriers to earlier diagnosis, and support identified as helpful. We identified 126 papers reporting 102 studies including a total of 3,095 participants. Three overarching themes emerged from our analysis: (1) pathways through diagnosis, including its impact on identity, roles, and relationships; (2) resolving conflicts to accommodate a diagnosis, including the acceptability of support, focusing on the present or the future, and the use or avoidance of knowledge; and (3) strategies and support to minimise the impact of dementia. Consistent barriers to diagnosis include stigma, normalisation of symptoms, and lack of knowledge. Studies report a lack of specialist support particularly post-diagnosis.","There is an extensive body of qualitative literature on the experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia on receiving and adapting to a diagnosis of dementia. We present a thematic analysis that could be useful to professionals working with people with dementia.

Such under-representation biases estimates of absolute effect, absolute harm and cost-effectiveness. Research on dementia should include patient populations that more exactly reflect the population at risk. One of the impediments to this is the lack of a suitable tool for identification of patients suitable for studies. CONSTRUCTION & CONTENTS: A technology development methodology was used to develop a registry of people with dementia and their carers. This involved phases of modelling and prototype creation, 'bench testing' the prototype with experts and then 'field testing' the refined prototype in exemplar sites. The evaluation of the field testing described here is based on a case study methodology. UTILITY: This case study suggests that construction and population of a dementia research registry is feasible, but initial development is complex because of the ethical and organisational difficulties. Recruitment from primary care is particularly costly in terms of staff time and only identifies a very small number of people with dementia who were not already known to specialist services. Recruiting people with dementia through secondary care is a resource intensive process that takes up to six months to complete. Identifying the components of a minimum dataset was easy but its usefulness for pre-screening potential research populations has yet to be established. Acceptance rates are very high in the first clinic to recruit to the registry, but this may reflect the efforts of registry 'champions'.","Easier recruitment may perpetuate potential selection biases and we are not yet able to assess the representativeness of the research-ready population recruited to the registry. The need to recruit from wider populations, through primary and social care, remains. The success of this registry will be measured by the proportion of people from it who are recruited to research projects, and its impact on overall accrual to studies."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research

focus groups and complexity of decision making in individual interviews.","Community settings in London.","43 family carers of people with dementia in focus groups and 46 carers who had already made such decisions in individual interviews.","Family carers identified five core problematic areas of decision making: accessing dementia related health and social services; care homes; legal-financial matters; non-dementia related health care; and making plans for the person with dementia if the carer became too ill to care for them. They highlighted the difficulties in making proxy decisions, especially against active resistance, and their altered role of patient manager while still a family member. Families devised strategies to gain agreement in order to ensure that the person with dementia retained dignity.","The following strategies helped with implementation of decisions: introducing change slowly; organising legal changes for the carer as well as the patient; involving a professional to persuade the patient to accept services; and emphasising that services optimised, not impeded, independence. To access services, carers made patients' general practice appointments, accompanied them to the surgery, pointed out symptoms, gained permission to receive confidential information, asked for referral to specialist services, and used professionals' authority to gain patients' agreement. End of life decisions were particularly difficult. They were helped by knowledge of the person with dementia's previous views, clear prognostic information, and family support. Information sheets to help carers to overcome barriers to proxy decision making have been developed; their impact in practice has yet to be

survival of people with dementia diagnosed at age 60-69 was 6.7 (interquartile range 3.1-10.8) years, falling to 1.9 (0.7-3.6) years for those diagnosed at age 90 or over. Adjusted mortality rates were highest in the first year after diagnosis (relative risk 3.68, 95% confidence interval 3.44 to 3.94). This dropped to 2.49 (2.29 to 2.71) in the second year. The incidence of recorded dementia remained stable over time (3-4\/1000 person years at risk). The incidence was higher in women and in younger age groups (60-79 years) living in deprived areas.","Median survival was much lower than in screened populations. These clinically relevant estimates can assist patients and carers, clinicians, and policy makers when planning support for this population. The high risk of death in the first year after diagnosis may reflect diagnoses made at times of crisis or late in the disease trajectory.

Dementia is probably under-diagnosed and under treated with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary care physicians. This problem of under-diagnosis is probably not due to lack of diagnostic skills, but rather to the interaction of case-complexity, pressure on time and the negative effects of reimbursement systems. Primary care physicians often over-estimate the prevalence of dementia syndromes, but in some countries may also overestimate the prevalence of vascular dementia compared with Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosis is a step-wise process which can be aided by use of a cognitive function test, of which there are a number suitable for primary care use. Evidence based practice protocols can enhance detection rates in primary care, and there is growing evidence that communication skills in talking to people with dementia about dementia can be improved. Nevertheless there are multiple obstacles to bringing recognition forward in time, both in public awareness and professional understanding of the early changes in dementia.","There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify population screening in primary care but earlier recognition of people with dementia syndrome is possible within primary care. The diagnosis of dementia is a shared responsibility between generalist and specialist disciplines. Primary care physicians should explore patients' ideas and concerns around their symptoms prior to referral and tentatively discuss possible diagnoses. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the primary care physician should provide both practical and emotional support to allow the patient and their family to come to terms with living with dementia, and refer them for additional psychosocial support if required."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care for Older People, University College London, London, NW3 2PF, UK. s.iliffe@pcps.ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rait","ForeName":"Greta","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ashley","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"DeNDRoN Primary Care Clinical Studies Group"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MC_U122797163","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Physician-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"66"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"20","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19226529","10.1002\/gps.2204"]}}}]}
