Errorless learning is mostly examined by counting correctly executed task steps or by rating them using a Task Performance Scale (TPS). Here, we explore the validity and reliability of a new assessment procedure, the core elements method (CEM), which rates essential building blocks of activities rather than individual steps. Task performance was assessed in 35 patients with Alzheimer's dementia recruited from the Relearning methods on Daily Living task performance of persons with Dementia (REDALI-DEM) study using TPS and CEM independently. Results showed excellent interrater reliabilities for both measure methods (CEM: intraclass coefficient [ICC] = .85; TPS: ICC = .97). Also, both methods showed a high agreement (CEM: mean of measurement difference [MD] = -3.44, standard deviation [SD] = 14.72; TPS: MD = -0.41, SD = 7.89) and correlated highly (>.75). Based on these results, TPS and CEM are both valid for assessing task performance. However, since TPS is more complicated and time consuming, CEM may be the preferred method for future research projects.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s)

mono-centre randomised controlled trial has shown that occupational therapy improves daily functioning in dementia. The aim of this present study is to compare the effects of the Dutch community occupational therapy programme with a community occupational therapy consultation on daily functioning in older people with mild or moderate dementia and their primary caregivers in a German multi-centre context.","A multi-centre single blind randomised controlled trial design is being used in seven health care centres (neurological, psychiatric and for older people) in urban regions. Patients are 1:1 randomised to treatment or control group. Assessors are blind to group assignment and perform measurements on both groups at baseline, directly after intervention at 6 weeks and at 16, 26 and 52 weeks follow-up. A sample of 140 community dwelling older people (aged >65 years) with mild or moderate dementia and their primary caregivers is planned. The experimental intervention consists of an evidence-based community occupational therapy programme including 10 sessions occupational therapy at home. The control intervention consists of one community occupational therapy consultation based on information material of the Alzheimer Society. Providers of both interventions are occupational therapists experienced in treatment of cognitively impaired older people and trained in both programmes. 'Community' indicates that occupational therapy intervention occurs in the person's own home. The primary outcome is patients' daily functioning assessed with the performance scale of the Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia and video tapes of daily activities rated by external raters blind to group assignment using the Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System of Task Analysis. Secondary outcomes are patients' and caregivers' quality of life, mood and satisfaction with treatment; the caregiver's sense of competence, caregiver's diary (medication, resource utilisation, time of informal care); and the incidence of long-term institutionalisation. Process evaluation is performed by questionnaires and focus group discussion.","The transfer from the Dutch mono-centre design to the pragmatic multi-site trial in a German context implicates several changes in design issues including differences in recruitment time, training of interventionists and active control group treatment.The study is registered under DRKS00000053 at the German register of clinical trials, which is connected to the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Voigt-Radloff","ForeName":"Sebastian","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

conceptual-semantic impairments observed in a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) at mild to moderate stages of the disease. Several studies of groups of patients have shown correlations between focal hypometabolism or hypoperfusion in left hemispheric areas and measures of verbal semantic memory impairment in AD patients. The question remains, however, whether left hemispheric hypometabolism is sufficient to produce such impairment in the single case and whether nonverbal semantic knowledge is also affected. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose-F18 (FDG), statistical parametric mapping (SPM), and tests of verbal and nonverbal semantic memory in 11 AD patients with a mean score on the Mini-Mental State Examination of 22.6 (+\/-2.8). Naming impairment was significantly associated with left hemispheric asymmetry of hypometabolism on a single-case basis. Our correlation analysis showed that metabolism in left anterior temporal, posterior inferior temporal, inferior parietal and medial occipital areas (Brodmann areas: 21\/38, 37, 40 and 19) correlated with both verbal and nonverbal semantic performance. We conclude that left hemispheric synaptic dysfunction, as measured by regional glucose hypometabolism, was sufficient to produce semantic impairments in our patients. The majority of areas affected in our patients with semantic impairments were involved in multimodal or supramodal (verbal and nonverbal) semantic knowledge."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zahn","ForeName":"Roland","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Hauptstr. 5, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany. roland_zahn@psyallg.ukl.uni-freiburg.de"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Juengling","ForeName":"Freimut","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bubrowski","ForeName":"Philine","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jost","ForeName":"Elke","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dykierek","ForeName":"Petra","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Talazko","ForeName":"Jochen","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Huell","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Ireland","MedlineTA":"Psychiatry Res","NlmUniqueID":"7911385","ISSNLinking":"0165-1781"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Radiopharmaceuticals"},{"RegistryNumber":"0Z5B2CJX4D","NameOfSubstance":"Fluorodeoxyglucose F18"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","metabolism"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Fluorodeoxyglucose F18","QualifierName":"pharmacokinetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Functional Laterality","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Language"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Parietal Lobe","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Positron-Emission Tomography"},{"DescriptorName":"Radiopharmaceuticals","QualifierName":["pharmacokinetics","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Semantics"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Temporal Lobe","QualifierName":"metabolism"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2004","Month":"06","Day":"11"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2004","Month":"07","Day":"30"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"12","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"3","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"12","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15598550","S0925-4927(04)00098-8","10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2004.07.006"]}}}]}
