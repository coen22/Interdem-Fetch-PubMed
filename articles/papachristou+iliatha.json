The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate the content, format, and usefulness of two separate booklets (one newly developed and one existing) on food-related processes. Twenty dementia caregivers were provided with one of the two booklets, and a Think-Aloud method was used to gather information about their views on the booklets. The findings indicated that incorporating all three food processes in a new booklet could be beneficial for the participant. Shopping, purchasing food, driving, and dangers in the kitchen were addressed only in the developed booklet, and participants regarded them as important and useful areas to address. Therefore, this study has shown that tailored information may enhance caregivers' confidence and support them in making decisions to help them adapt to food-related changes."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Papachristou","ForeName":"Iliatha","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hickeys","ForeName":"Gary","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Kingston University, Surrey, BC, Canada."},{"Affiliation":"3 St George's, University of London, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 University College London, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"08","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Appl Gerontol","NlmUniqueID":"8606502","ISSNLinking":"0733-4648"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Automobile Driving"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Commerce"},{"DescriptorName":"Cooking"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Drinking"},{"DescriptorName":"Eating"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Food","QualifierName":"economics"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Menu Planning"},{"DescriptorName":"Pamphlets"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Restaurants"},{"DescriptorName":"Validation Studies as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","food-related processes","informal caregiving","qualitative methodology","written information"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27496141","0733464816661946","10.1177\/0733464816661946"]}}}}
