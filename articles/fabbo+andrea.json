Occupational therapy (OT) has been effective in the management of dementia. We designed a real-world feasibility study of an OT intervention in the management of delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD).","We included a convenient sample of 22 patients older than 65\u00a0years of age with delirium and moderate dementia admitted to a nursing home (NH). The OT procedures were standardized according to the level of agitation or sedation of the patient and based on a structured OT evaluation. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was used to evaluate the proxy perception of performance in the daily activities at baseline and at delirium resolution.","The mean age was 86.45\u2009\u00b1\u20096.46\u00a0years. The first daily treatment was delivered in the entire sample, while the second was delivered in 63.46% on day 1, 72.72% on day 2, 25% on day 3, 66.67% on day 4, 100% on days 5 and 6. The main time of the first daily treatment varied, day 1 through day 6, from 14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5 to 20\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u00a0min; while the second daily treatment, in the same period, from 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7 to 20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u00a0min. The mean time of the first treatment varied day 1 through day 6 from 14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5 to 20\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u00a0min, while the second treatment from 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7 to 20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u00a0min. The COPM proxy performance and proxy satisfaction increased from delirium onset to delirium resolution.","This is the first study to report the feasibility of an OT intervention for the management of DSD in a NH setting. The results are important to support future trials on delirium management in a setting often understudied and underrepresented."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pozzi","ForeName":"Christian","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"University of Applied, Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI), Manno, Switzerland."},{"Affiliation":"Geriatric Research Group, Brescia, Italy."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lanzoni","ForeName":"Alessandro","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"NODAIA Unit, Villa Igea, Modena, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lucchi","ForeName":"Elena","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Geriatric Research Group, Brescia, Italy."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Rehabilitation and Aged Care Hospital Ancelle, Cremona, Italy."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Salimbeni","ForeName":"Isabella","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Nursing Home Fondazione E.

cognitive status in a group of elderly patients with vitamin D deficiency and high burden of comorbidities attending Geriatric Outpatient Clinics.","We studied the relationship between 25(OH)D and cognitive functions taking into account comorbidities and cognitive functions assessed by MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination), CDT (Clock Drawing Test) and CIRS (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale), in 132 consecutive elderly patients with low levels of 25(OH)D (<10 ng\/ml) compatible with the condition of vitamin deficiency. The association among 25(OH)D levels, MMSE score, CDT score and CIRS scores were analyzed using Pearson correlation. All the elderly patients received an adequate vitamin D supplementation and were reassessed after 6 months.","At baseline, mean MMSE and CIRS scores were: 21.8+5.56 and 2.96 +1.63 respectively. Mean CDT score was 3,66+-2.05. No associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and global cognitive function. A significant relationship was observed between the total CIRS score and 25(OH)D levels (r=0.305; p=0.000) as well as between total CIRS score and MMSE (r=-0.375; p=0.000). After 6 months, 83.9 % had 25(OH)D levels >20 ng\/ml. Mean MMSE and CDT scores were 22.20+-5.76 and 3.90+-2.06 respectively. There was no significant correlation among 25(OH)D, MMSE and CDT scores while a significant correlation was found between 25(OH)D and CIRS- severity score (r=0.275; p=0.001) and between MMSE and total CIRS scores (r=-0.247; p=0.005 for CIRS-comorbidities; r=-0.184; p=0.04 for CIRS-severity). A post hoc evaluation on two subgroups of elderly patients (the first with vitamin D deficiency without cognitive impairment, the second with vitamin D deficiency and dementia) showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.00001) regarding the CIRS-comorbidities scores.","In our cohort of elderly patients with a high burden of comorbidities, 25(OH)D low levels (<10 ng\/ml) are not associated with MMSE and CDT scores. There is no statistically difference among the levels of 25(OH)D and MMSE and CDT scores after 6 months. The strong correlation we found regarding CIRS-comorbidities in the two sub-groups suggests that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in promoting cognitive impairment only with comorbidities."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manzo","ForeName":"Ciro","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro delle Demenze, Distretto Sanitario 51, ASL NA 3 Sud, Pomigliano d'Arco (NA) -

physical and mental health. The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) is the most widely used instrument for assessing family carer burden and the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the ZBI (I-ZBI).","I-ZBI was administered to a non-randomized sample of 273 caregivers related to consecutively attending outpatients with a previously established primary diagnosis of dementia, according to DSM-IV criteria. Measurements used for the construct validity of the instrument were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Validity and reliability were evaluated, as well as the factor structure of the instrument.","Most caregivers were children (65%), female (72%) and living with the patient (53%), with quite a high level of burden. The I-ZBI demonstrates good reliability with high internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.90) and split-half correlation of 0.78, and good concurrent validity with other assessment tools. A five-factor solution was obtained for the I-ZBI and the original bi-factorial structure of the ZBI was not confirmed.","The Italian version of the Zarit Burden Interview is valid, reliable and useful for use in clinical contexts and in future studies that could lead to a better understanding of carer burden in dementia. Clarifying the factorial structure of the ZBI would help to further the understanding of the large body of research using it and would also help to advance the understanding of subjective burden."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chattat","ForeName":"Rabih","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cortesi","ForeName":"Valeria","Initials":"V"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Izzicupo","ForeName":"Fabio","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Del Re","ForeName":"Maria Letizia","Initials":"ML"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sgarbi","ForeName":"Cinzia","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fabbo","ForeName":"Andrea","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bergonzini","ForeName":"Elisa","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Validation Study"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost of Illness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interview, Psychological","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Italy"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Translating"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"4","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21205379","S1041610210002218","10.1017\/S1041610210002218"]}}}]}
