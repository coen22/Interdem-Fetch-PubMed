Social return on investment (SROI) analysis, a form of cost-benefit analysis, has the potential to capture the value of arts interventions, but few rigorous SROI analyses exist. This article presents a framework for an SROI analysis.","One hundred twenty-five people with mild to severe dementia and 146 caregivers were recruited to the Dementia and Imagination study across residential care homes, a hospital and community venues in England and Wales for a 12-week visual arts program. Quantitative and qualitative data on quality of life, support, and program perceptions were obtained through interviews. SROI was undertaken to explore the wider social value of the arts activities.","An input of \u00a3189,498 ($279,320\/\u20ac257,338) to deliver the groups created a social value of \u00a3980,717 ($1,445,577\/\u20ac1,331,814). This equates to a base case scenario of \u00a3\/$\/\u20ac5.18 of social value generated for every \u00a3\/$\/\u20ac1 invested. Sensitivity analysis produced a range from \u00a3\/$\/\u20ac3.20 to \u00a3\/$\/\u20ac6.62 per \u00a3\/$\/\u20ac1, depending on assumptions about benefit materialization; financial value of participants' time; and length of sustained benefit.","To our knowledge, this is the first study applying SROI to an arts intervention for people with dementia. Arts-based activities appear to provide a positive SROI under a range of assumptions.","Decision makers are increasingly seeking wider forms of economic evidence surrounding the costs and benefits of activities.

Quantitative and qualitative data on quality of life (QoL), communication and perceptions of the program were obtained through interviews and self-reports with participants and their carers. Eight domains of well-being were measured using a standardized observation tool, and data compared to an alternative activity with no art.","Across all sites, scores for the well-being domains of interest, attention, pleasure, self-esteem, negative affect, and sadness were significantly better in the art program than the alternative condition. Proxy-reported QoL significantly improved between baseline and 3-month follow-up, but no improvements in QoL were reported by the participants with dementia. This was contrasted by their qualitative accounts, which described a stimulating experience important for social connectedness, well-being, and inner-strength.

The theory building process consists of a realist review of primary research on visual art programmes. This aims to uncover what works, for whom, how, why and in what circumstances. We undertook a qualitative exploration of stakeholder perspectives of art programmes, and then synthesised these two pieces of work alongside broader theory to produce a conceptual framework for intervention development, further research and practice. This suggests effective programmes are realised through essential attributes of two key conditions (provocative and stimulating aesthetic experience; dynamic and responsive artistic practice). These conditions are important for cognitive, social and individual responses, leading to benefits for people with early to more advanced dementia. This work represents a starting point at identifying theories of change for arts interventions, and for further research to critically examine, refine and strengthen the evidence base for the arts in dementia care.

bringing together arts and science to address current evidence limitations around the benefits of visual art activities in dementia care. The research questions ask: Can art improve quality of life and well-being? If it does make a difference, how does it do this-and why? Does it have wider social and community benefits?","This mixed-methods study recruits participants from residential care homes, National Health Service (NHS) wards and communities in England and Wales. A visual art intervention is developed and delivered as 1\u00d72-hour weekly group session for 3\u2005months in care and community settings to N=100 people living with dementia. Quantitative and qualitative data are collected at 3 time points to examine the impact on their quality of life, and the perceptions of those who care for them (N=100 family and professional carers). Repeated-measures systematic observations of well-being are obtained during the intervention (intervention vs control condition). The health economics component conducts a social return on investment evaluation of the intervention. Qualitative data are collected at 3 time points (n=35 carers\/staff and n=35 people living with dementia) to explore changes in social connectedness. Self-reported outcomes of the intervention delivery are obtained (n=100). Focus groups with intervention participants (n=40) explore perceptions of impact. Social network analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from arts and healthcare professionals (N=100) examines changes in perceptions and practice.","The study is approved by North Wales Research Ethics Committee-West. A range of activities will share the research findings, including international and national academic conferences, quarterly newsletters and the project website. Public engagement projects will target a broad range of stakeholders. Policy and practice summaries will be developed. The visual art intervention protocol will be developed as a freely available practitioners guide."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The prevalence of resilience varied between 35 and 43%, depending on the demand for high care. Being a male caregiver, caring for a female, living apart from your relative, and low caregiver burden were positively related to caregiver resilience.","Caregivers have the capacity to demonstrate resilience despite significant challenges.

This study aimed to address these limitations and add new insights, identifying the essential features of resilience in dementia caregiving.","A Delphi consensus study was conducted, consulting a multi-disciplinary panel of informal caregivers and experts with relevant professional expertise. Panellists rated the relevance of various statements addressing essential components of resilience; 'adversity' and 'successful caregiving' on a 5-point Likert scale.

Patients' behavioural problems and feeling competent as a caregiver were selected by both caregivers and professionals as essential resilience features. Caregivers also emphasized the importance of social support, the quality of the relationship with their relative and enjoying spending time together. Professionals considered coping skills, experiencing positive aspects of caregiving, and a good quality of life of caregivers most relevant.","The essential elements of resilience selected from multiple stakeholder perspectives can be used to select appropriate outcomes for intervention studies and give guidance to policy to support caregivers more effectively and better tailored to their needs."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joling","ForeName":"Karlijn J","Initials":"KJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a VU University Medical Center , EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine , Amsterdam , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Windle","ForeName":"Gill","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University , Bangor , United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dr\u00f6es","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c VU University Medical Center , EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, Department of Psychiatry , Amsterdam , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Huisman","ForeName":"Martijn","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"d VU University Medical Center , EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, Department of Psychiatry, Department of Sociology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics , Amsterdam , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hertogh","ForeName":"Cees M P M","Initials":"CMPM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a VU University Medical Center , EMGO+ Institute for Health and Care Research, Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine , Amsterdam , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Dementia Services Development Centre Wales , School of Healthcare Sciences, Bangor University , Bangor , United Kingdom."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Delphi Technique"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Resilience, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Delphi method","Resilience","adversity","dementia","family caregivers"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26689489","10.1080\/13607863.2015.1124836"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25128286","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2046-4053","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Aug","Day":"15"}},"Title":"Systematic reviews","ISOAbbreviation":"Syst Rev"},"ArticleTitle":"Understanding the impact of visual arts interventions for people living with dementia: a realist review protocol.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"91"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/2046-4053-3-91","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Arts-based activities are being increasingly suggested as a valuable activity for people living with dementia in terms of countering the negative aspects of their condition. The potential for such programmes to improve a broad range of psychosocial outcomes is suggested in some studies. However, there is largely an absence of rigorous methodology to demonstrate the benefits, and research results are mixed. Practice variability in terms of the content, contexts and implementation of such interventions raises challenges in terms of identifying an optimal arts programme model that could be adopted by other service providers. Understanding how interventions may have the best chance at broad implementation success and uptake is limited.","A realist review will be undertaken. This aims to understand how visual arts interventions influence outcomes in people living with dementia. The review will explore how the context, that is the circumstances which enable or constrain, affect outcomes through the activation of mechanisms. An early scoping search and a stakeholder survey formulated the preliminary programme theory. A systematic literature search across a broad range of disciplines (arts, humanities, social sciences, health) will be undertaken to identify journal articles and grey literature. Data will be extracted in relation to the programme theory, contextual factors, mechanisms and outcomes and their configurations, background information about the study design and participant characteristics, detail about the quantity ('dose') of an intervention, theoretical perspectives proposed by the authors of the paper and further theorising by the reviewer. Thematic connections\/patterns will be sought across the extracted data, identifying patterns amongst contextual factors, the mechanisms they trigger and the associated outcomes.","Along with stakeholder engagement and validation, this review will help inform the development of an optimal, replicable arts intervention for people with dementia as part of our broader research programme, titled 'Dementia and Imagination' (funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council). Forthcoming work under this programme of research will test this theoretically informed intervention in three different geographical areas of the UK.

Rich and valuable data during the sessions may be missed by using standard quality of life questionnaires. This paper compares observational measures in the context of recording the well-being of a person with dementia during and outside of a visual arts intervention. A literature search was conducted using systematic principles of searching, screening and retrieval to identify peer-reviewed English language evaluations of research projects using observational measures with people with dementia. Psychometric properties, strengths and weaknesses of 11 observational tools are reviewed in order to identify the most appropriate one for evaluating a visual art intervention for people with dementia. This review supports the Greater Cincinnati Chapter Well-Being Observation Tool as an appropriate measure to evaluate a visual art programme for people with dementia. The results of this review will help researchers plan projects to show the full range of effects for people with dementia for taking part in art sessions.
