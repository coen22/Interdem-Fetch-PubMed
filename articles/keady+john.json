However, little is known about the challenges experienced by professionals when making the transition to post-graduate study. This was a qualitative study comprising individual interviews with 15 graduates, nine of whom were nurses, who had experience of attending a part-time Master's in Dementia Care in the Northwest of England. Four sequential themes emerged from the data: 'Deciding what to do', 'Taking it on', 'Keeping going' and 'Endings and New beginnings'. Findings confirmed that Master's education for nurses and other professionals is significant in developing knowledge and instilling confidence in changing practice. Nevertheless, professionals experienced challenges in juggling the competing demands of education, family and work and were seen to navigate and negotiate their student journey by drawing on internal resources and external supports. The study adds to evidence that Master's level study is likely to benefit practice in dementia care; however, employers and Higher Education Institutions need to develop effective and flexible supports to enable nurses and allied professionals to engage effectively in part-time taught post graduate education.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The first phase of a COS study is to form a 'long-list' of outcomes. Key stakeholders then decide on their importance. COS reporting is described as suboptimal and this first phase is often under-reported. Our objective was to develop a 'long-list' of outcome items for non-pharmacological interventions for people with dementia living at home.","Three iterative phases were conducted. First, people living with dementia, care partners, health and social care professionals, policymakers and researchers (n\u00a0=\u200955) took part in interviews or focus groups and were asked which outcomes were important. Second, existing dementia trials were identified from the ALOIS database. 248 of 1009 pharmacological studies met the inclusion criteria. Primary and secondary outcomes were extracted from a 50% random sample (n\u00a0=\u2009124) along with eight key reviews\/qualitative papers and 38 policy documents. Third, extracted outcome items were translated onto an existing qualitative framework and mapped into domains. The research team removed areas of duplication and refined the 'long-list' in eight workshops.","One hundred seventy outcome items were extracted from the qualitative data and literature. The 170 outcome items were consolidated to 54 in four domains (Self-Managing Dementia Symptoms, Quality of Life, Friendly Neighbourhood & Home, Independence).","This paper presents a transparent blueprint for 'long-list' development. Though a useful resource in their own right, the 54 outcome items will be distilled further in a modified Delphi survey and consensus meeting to identify core outcomes."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harding","ForeName":"Andrew J

beyond the role of 'participant' to involvement in all areas of the research process. This reflects shifts in dementia studies from 'research on' to 'research with' people living with the condition. In this paper, we describe the design process and features of a modified Delphi survey devised through consultation with people living with dementia.","This article focusses on consultation with people living with dementia and care partners to design an accessible Delphi survey to facilitate participation in core outcome set development. We used the COINED model of co-research developed through the ESRC\/NIHR Neighbourhoods and Dementia Study to structure consultation on three features of modified Delphi design. Consultation was achieved through 1:1 and group sessions with a total of 28 individuals (18 people living with dementia and seven care partners).","A flexible, responsive and adaptive approach to ongoing consultation with people living with dementia and care partners through 1:1 face-to-face sessions facilitated: (1) the development of a 3-point non-categorical importance scale; (2) the translation of 54 outcome areas into 'accessible statements' for a two-round Delphi survey administered to five stakeholder groups (people living with dementia, care partners, health and social care professionals, policy-makers and researchers); and (3) the delivery of a Delphi survey. These features of core outcome set development facilitated the involvement of people living with dementia in study design and as research participants in the data collection phase.","Involvement of people living with dementia as a key stakeholder group is not reflected in studies using Delphi survey methods for core outcome set development. Time, resources, researcher expertise and support, underpinned through targeted funding facilitate meaningful and productive inclusive approaches, now an expectation of dementia research.","The study

In particular, no evidence currently exists to demonstrate the likely complex decision-making processes for this patient group and the oncology healthcare professionals (HCP) involved in their care. The aim of this study was to explore the cancer-related information needs and decision-making experiences of patients with cancer and comorbid dementia, their informal caregivers and oncology HCPs.","Cross-sectional qualitative study. Semistructured interviews were conducted face to face with participants. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed prior to thematic analysis.","Patients with a diagnosis of cancer and dementia, their informal caregivers and oncology HCPs involved in their care, all recruited from a regional treatment cancer centre.","Purposeful sample of 10 patients with a diagnosis of cancer-dementia, informal caregivers (n=9) and oncology HCPs (n=12).","Four themes were identified: (1) leading to the initial consultation-HCPs require more detailed information on the functional impact of dementia and how it may influence cancer treatment options prior to meeting the patient; (2) communicating clinically relevant information-informal caregivers are relied on to provide patient information, advocate for the patient and support decision-making; (3) adjustments to cancer care-patients with dementia get through treatment with the help of their family and (4) following completion of cancer treatment-there are continuing information needs. Oncology HCPs discussed their need to consult specialists in dementia care to support treatment decision-making.","Although patients with cancer-dementia are involved in their treatment decision-making, informal caregivers are generally crucial in supporting this process. Individual patient needs and circumstances related to their cancer must be considered in the context of dementia prognosis highlighting complexities of decision-making in this population.

people, our places\" an international study about how people living with dementia interact with their neighborhoods. The ideas of social health and citizenship are drawn upon to contextualize the data and make a case for recognizing and understanding the strengths and agency of people with dementia. In particular, we address the lived experience of the environment as a route to better understanding the capabilities, capacities, and competencies of people living with dementia. In doing this, our aim is to demonstrate the contribution of social engagement and environmental support to social health.","The study aims to \"map\" local spaces and networks across three field sites (Manchester, Central Scotland and Linkoping, Sweden). It employs a mix of qualitative and participatory approaches that include mobile and visual methods intended to create knowledge that will inform the design and piloting of a neighborhood-based intervention.","Our research shows that the neighborhood plays an active role in the lives of people with dementia, setting limits, and constraints but also offering significant opportunities, encompassing forms of help and support as yet rarely discussed in the field of dementia studies. The paper presents new and distinctive insights into the relationship between neighborhoods and everyday life for people with dementia that have important implications for the debate on social health and policy concerning dementia friendly communities.","We end by reflecting on the messages for policy and practice that are beginning to emerge from this on-going study."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ward","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of

how practitioners, service providers and society in general can help individuals to live well with the condition. An important aspect to this is provision of advice to ensure conversation partners effectively support the person with dementia in conversation.","To provide a descriptive review of the literature examining everyday conversation in dementia in order to inform practice and research.","This review used a method specifically developed for reviewing conversation analytic and related literature. A range of databases were searched using key words and explicitly described inclusion criteria leading to a final corpus of 50 titles. Using this qualitative methodology, each paper was examined and data extracted. The contribution of each of these is described and the implications for practice and research are outlined.","This review examined studies into conversation in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia, grouping these into: early influential studies; work drawing on positioning theory; studies using social and linguistic approaches; collaborative storytelling; formulaic language; studies specifically using conversation analysis; and conversation as a target for individualized therapy. In addition, more recent work examining primary progressive aphasia and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia was explored. Overall, this review indicates that research examining conversation in natural settings provides a rich source of data to explore not just the challenges within conversation for those taking part, but also the skills retained by the person with dementia. An important aspect of this understanding is the notion that these skills relate not only to information exchange but also aspects of social interaction. The role of others in scaffolding the conversation abilities of the person with dementia and the potential of this for developing interventions are discussed.","The review indicates that interventions targeting conversation in dementia are often advocated in the literature but currently such approaches remain to be systematically evaluated. In addition, many of the important insights arising from these studies have yet to inform multidisciplinary dementia care practice."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 The Authors International

residents with dementia in long-stay care. \"Becoming a person again\" emerged as the core category accounting for staffs' psychosocial intervention use within long-stay care. Interview data were collected from participants in nine Irish long-stay settings: 14 residents with dementia, 19 staff nurses, one clinical facilitator, seven nurse managers, 21 nursing assistants, and five relatives. Constant comparative method guided the data collection and analysis. The researcher's theoretical memos, based on unstructured observation, and applicable extant literature were also included as data. By identifying the mutuality of the participants' experiences, this classic grounded theory explains staff motivation toward psychosocial intervention use within long-stay care. It also explains how institutional factors interact with those personal factors that incline individuals toward psychosocial intervention use.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hunter","ForeName":"Andrew","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland andrew.hunter@nuigalway.ie."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Casey","ForeName":"Dympna","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grealish","ForeName":"Annmarie","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Kings College London, London, England."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murphy","ForeName":"Kathy","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Qual Health Res","NlmUniqueID":"9202144","ISSNLinking":"1049-7323"},"CitationSubset":"T","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Grounded Theory"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Ireland","dementia","grounded theory","psychology-psychological issues","qualitative research","quality of life"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"4","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"3","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26935720","1049732316632194","10.1177\/1049732316632194"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27546009","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"17"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1467-9566","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"38","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11"}},"Title":"Sociology of health & illness","ISOAbbreviation":"Sociol Health Illn"},"ArticleTitle":"Assembling the salon: Learning from alternative forms of body work in dementia care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1287-1302"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/1467-9566.12461","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This article explores the labour and experiences of a hitherto entirely overlooked section of the dementia care workforce: care-based hairdressers. Reporting on findings from the ESRC-funded 'Hair and Care' project, the analysis and discussion focus upon the 'doing of hair' in the context of dementia care. The authors challenge existing assumptions and approaches to the management of appearance in dementia care, arguing for greater recognition of the subjective and culturally meaningful qualities of a visit to the salon. The article draws upon a wider debate on body work as a framework for the discussion, and considers the employment and working conditions of this largely hidden group of workers in the care system. The article offers an account of the praxis of care-based hairdressing, with particular attention paid to narrative, intercorporeal and place-making practices in the salon, showing how a particular approach to the body shapes the labour, relationships and activities that unfold within it. The authors argue that as an alternative form of body work much can be learned from hairdressing that can inform and enhance the provision of dementia care.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ward","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Applied Social Science, University of Stirling, UK. richard.ward1@stir.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Campbell","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, University of Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, University of Manchester, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"08","Day":"22"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Sociol Health Illn","NlmUniqueID":"8205036","ISSNLinking":"0141-9889"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Anthropology, Cultural"},{"DescriptorName":"Barbering","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Beauty Culture","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Body Image","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Employment","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Hair"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["body work","care","dementia","embodiment","hairdressing"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27546009","10.1111\/1467-9566.12461","PMC6849840"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Med Health Care Philos. 2014 Feb;17(1):131-41","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24065459"}},{"Citation":"Sociol Health Illn. 2011 Feb;33(2):189-205","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21299568"}},{"Citation":"J Aging Stud. 2014 Aug;30:64-72","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24984909"}},{"Citation":"Dementia (London). 2013 May;12(3):288-302","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24336852"}},{"Citation":"J Aging Stud. 2014 Aug;30:23-32","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"24984905"}},{"Citation":"Health Educ Behav. 2004 Dec;31(6):790-807","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15539548"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2006 Feb;46(1):89-96","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16452288"}},{"Citation":"Sociol Health Illn. 2011 Feb;33(2):171-88","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"21226736"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27753612","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"7-8","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2019 Oct-Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Visioning change: Co-producing a model of involvement and engagement in research (Innovative Practice).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"3165-3172"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301216674559","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The involvement of people living with dementia in research has traditionally been located in the realms of 'subject' or 'participant'.

Little is known about how this patient population is managed in hospital, with research to date focused mainly on care homes. This study aimed to investigate how pain is recognised, assessed and managed in patients with dementia in a range of acute hospital wards, to inform the development of a decision support tool to improve pain management for this group.","A qualitative, multi-site exploratory case study. Data were collected in four hospitals in England and Scotland. Methods included non-participant observations, audits of patient records, semi-structured interviews with staff and carers, and analysis of hospital ward documents. Thematic analysis was performed through the lens of decision making theory.","Staff generally relied on patients' self-report of pain. For patients with dementia, however, communication difficulties experienced because of their condition, the organisational context, and time frames of staff interactions, hindered patients' ability to provide staff with information about their pain experience. This potentially undermined the trials of medications used to provide pain relief to each patient and assessments of their responses to these treatments. Furthermore, given the multidisciplinary environment, a patient's communication about their pain involved several members of staff, each having to make sense of the patient's pain as in an 'overall picture'. Information about patients' pain, elicited in different ways, at different times and by different health care staff, was fragmented in paper-based documentation. Re-assembling the pieces to form a 'patient specific picture of the pain' required collective staff memory, 'mental computation' and time.","There is a need for an efficient method of eliciting and centralizing all pain-related information for patients with dementia, which is distributed in time and between personnel. Such a method should give an overall picture of a patient's pain which is rapidly accessible to all involved in their care. This would provide a much-needed basis for making decisions to support the effective management of the pain of older people with dementia in hospital."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lichtner","ForeName":"Valentina","Initials":"V","Identifier":"0000-0003-3956-3743","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School

through a focus on the everyday experiences of women living with dementia and in receipt of care. In particular, a link is drawn between hairdressing and citizenship in the context of dementia care. Informed by a wider debate over the importance of an emplaced, embodied and performative approach to citizenship, the authors highlight the way that intersecting forms of resistance unfold in the salon. The Hair and Care project, as the name implies, focused upon hair care and styling in the context of a wider consideration of appearance and how it is managed and what it means for people living with dementia. With a focus upon the routine, mundane and thereby often unproblematised aspects of everyday life in\/with care, the discussion draws together two key ideas concerned with the interplay of power and resistance: Essed's (1991) theory of 'everyday discrimination' and Scott's (1985) notion of 'everyday resistance'. The findings illuminate the creative and collective forms of agency exercised by older women living with dementia, in the context of their relationships with one another and with the hairdressers whose services and support inspire their loyalty and patronage. Findings from the study point to the link between (inter-)personal practices of appearance management and a wider set of social conditions that are manifest in the on-going struggle over time, space and bodies in dementia care.

However, limited understanding exists regarding the personal and relational meanings attributed to the diagnostic experience. Drawn from the findings of a larger multi-site study conducted in four areas of England, this article presents a subset of the data where five participants and their carers and two people living alone initially presented themselves at a memory clinic for diagnostic testing, with this presentation eventually resulting in a confirmed, and shared, diagnosis of dementia. All 12 participants were interviewed at two time points in the study: at the time of first presentation to the memory clinic and shortly after the diagnosis had been shared with them. Informed by the grounded theory method, constant comparative analysis was applied to the data and this process resulted in a four-phase sequential model of diagnostic transition: (1) becoming self-aware\u2192seeking outside help; (2) being referred\u2192receiving a clinic appointment; (3) undergoing tests\u2192being told what's wrong; and (4) adjusting to the diagnosis\u2192negotiating everyday expectations. Running through each phase was the core category of 'living with uncertainty' which summarised the entire diagnostic journey for all study participants. Findings suggest a need for better awareness and information for people living with dementia at all phases and time points in the condition, which may be fostered by embedding these in early clinical encounters.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups as compared to usual care.","This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial had two parallel arms: intervention group and usual-care control group. A restricted dynamic method of randomisation was used, with an overall allocation ratio of 1:1, restricted to ensure viable sized intervention groups. Assessments, blind to treatment allocation, were carried out at baseline, three months and ten months (primary end-point), usually in the person's home. Participants were recruited in eight centres, mainly through NHS Memory Clinics and NHS community mental health teams. Included participants were community resident people with mild to moderate dementia (DSM-IV), who had a relative or other care-giver in regular contact, to act as informant and willing and able to participate in intervention. 71% carers were spouses. 488 people with dementia (mean age 77.5)were randomised: 268 intervention, 220 control; 350 dyads completed the study (206 intervention, 144 control). The intervention evaluated was joint reminiscence groups (with up to 12 dyads) weekly for twelve weeks; monthly maintenance sessions for further seven months. Sessions followed a published treatment manual and were held in a variety of community settings. Two trained facilitators in each centre were supported by volunteers. Primary outcome measures were self-reported quality of life for the person with dementia (QoL-AD), psychological distress for the carer (General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures included: autobiographical memory and activities of daily living for the person with dementia; carer stress for the carer; mood, relationship quality and service use and costs for both.","The intention to treat analysis (ANCOVA) identified no differences in outcome between the intervention and control conditions on primary or secondary outcomes (self-reported QoL-AD mean difference 0.07 (-1.21 to 1.35), F = 0.48, p = 0.53). Carers of people with dementia allocated to the reminiscence intervention reported a significant increase in anxiety on a General Health Questionnaire-28 sub-scale at the ten month end-point (mean difference 1.25 (0.25 to 2.26), F = 8.28, p = 0.04). Compliance analyses suggested improved autobiographical memory, quality of life and relationship quality for people with dementia attending more reminiscence sessions, however carers attending more groups showed increased care-giving stress. Economic analyses from a public sector perspective indicated that joint reminiscence groups are unlikely to be cost-effective. There were no significant adverse effects attributed to the intervention. Potential limitations of the study include less than optimal attendance at the group sessions--only 57% of participants attended at least half of the intervention sessions over the 10 month period, and a higher rate of study withdrawal in the control group.","This trial does not support the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups. Possible beneficial effects for people with dementia who attend sessions as planned are offset by raised anxiety and stress in their carers. The reasons for these discrepant outcomes need to be explored further, and may necessitate reappraisal of the movement towards joint interventions.","ISRCTN Registry

training programme for general hospital staff and to further develop two outcome scales: the Confidence in Dementia scale for measuring confidence in working with people with dementia and the Knowledge in Dementia scale for measuring knowledge in dementia. Method Following a 'training the trainers' phase, the study involved the delivery of the 'Getting to Know Me' training programme to a large number of staff (n\u2009=\u2009517) across three National Health Service (NHS) Trusts situated in North-West England. The impact of the programme was evaluated using a pre-post design which explored: (i) changes in confidence in dementia, (ii) changes in knowledge in dementia, and (iii) changes in beliefs about behaviours that challenge. Results Statistically significant change was identified between pre-post training on all outcome measures (Confidence in Dementia: eight point increase, p\u2009<\u20090.001; Knowledge in Dementia: two point increase p\u2009<\u20090.001; controllability beliefs scale: four point decrease, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Medium to large effect sizes were demonstrated on all outcome measures. The psychometric properties of the Confidence in Dementia and Knowledge in Dementia scales are reported. Conclusion Staff knowledge in dementia and confidence in working with people with dementia significantly increased following attendance at the training sessions. The findings are consistent with preliminary findings and strengthen current knowledge about the impact of dementia care training in general hospitals. The Confidence in Dementia and Knowledge in Dementia scales continue to demonstrate psychometrically sound properties and demonstrate utility in the field of dementia research."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elvish","ForeName":"Ruth","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burrow","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cawley","ForeName":"Rosanne","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Liverpool, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harney","ForeName":"Kathryn","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pilling","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gregory","ForeName":"Julie","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Manchester\/Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"02","Day":"27"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitals, General"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["acute care","dementia","general hospital","scale","staff training"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"3","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"9","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"3","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26924840","1471301216634926","10.1177\/1471301216634926"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26880602","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1879-193X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"36","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Journal of aging studies","ISOAbbreviation":"J Aging Stud"},"ArticleTitle":"'Nobody would say that it is Alzheimer's or dementia at this age': Family adjustment following a diagnosis of early-onset dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"26-32"},"ELocationID":["10.1016\/j.jaging.2015.12.001","S0890-4065(15)30156-0"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Family interaction and intergenerational dynamics have been known to influence the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and as such, the understanding of such dynamics in the experience of transitions can assist in strengthening the support provided to families living with such diagnoses.

Patients with dementia (n=31) were the unit of data collection, nested in 11 wards (vascular, continuing care, stroke rehabilitation, orthopaedic, acute medicine, care of the elderly, elective and emergency surgery), located in four NHS hospital organizations in the UK. Data consisted of observations of patients at bedside (170h in total); observations of the context of care; audits of patient hospital records; documentary analysis of artefacts; semi-structured interviews (n=56) and informal open conversations with staff and carers (family members).","Existing conceptualizations of pain recognition, assessment and management do not fully explain how the decision process occurs in clinical practice. Our research indicates that pain recognition, assessment and management is not an individual cognitive activity; rather it is carried out by groups of individuals over time and within a specific organizational culture or climate, which influences both health care professional and patient behaviour.","We propose a revised theoretical model of decision making related to pain assessment and management for patients with dementia based on theories of sense-making, which is reflective of the reality of clinical decision making in acute hospital wards. The revised model recognizes the salience of individual cognition as well as acknowledging that decisions are constructed through social interaction and organizational context.

Its aim was to explore how to enable effective information access and promote awareness and understanding of dementia from a culturally Deaf perspective. A purposive sample of 26 Deaf people without dementia participated in one of three focus groups facilitated directly in British Sign Language (BSL) without an intermediate interpreter. The sample was differentiated by age, role in the Deaf community, and diversity of educational attainment and professional experience. A phenomenological approach underpinned the thematic analysis of data. The findings demonstrate: (i) translation into (BSL) is a necessary but not sufficient condition to support understanding. Attention to culturally preferred means of engagement with information is vital; (ii) the content of information is best presented utilising structures and formats which cohere with Deaf people's visual cognitive strengths; and (iii) the importance of cultural values and cultural practices in raising awareness and building understanding of dementia. These include collective rather than individual responsibility for knowledge transfer and the pan-national nature of knowledge transfer among Deaf people(s). The discussion demonstrates how these specific features of effective information access and awareness building have universal implications relevant to public engagement and the promotion of general knowledge consistent with the National Dementia Strategy (England).

In policy and practice there exists an assumption that the role of supporting a person to manage their appearance is easily assumed by another within caring encounters, only to be subsumed within the daily task-oriented provision of care. This paper reports on interviews conducted as part of the Hair and Care project, which explored questions of appearance and the meanings it holds with people with dementia. The research used 'appearance biographies', a method which allows for a range of topics to be considered about appearance throughout the life course, acting as a conduit for reminiscence and life story work. The paper reports on the key themes and findings from these interviews, discussing them in the context of a wider debate on dementia, self-expression and agency. A key question posed by the authors is whether appearance and the work invested in it are legitimate considerations for dementia care policy and practice. And if so, how should we make sense of this work and what significance should we attach to it? In seeking to answer these questions the authors position the perspectives and experiences of people with dementia as central to their analysis. A narrative framework is suggested as a useful basis on which to understand the work of managing appearance over the life course. The implications for policy and practice are outlined.

There has been some research quantitatively examining care partner stress and burden in frontotemporal dementia. There are, however, few studies exploring the subjective experiences of family members caring for those with frontotemporal dementia. Increased knowledge of such experiences would allow service providers to tailor intervention, support, and information better. We used a case study design, with thematic narrative analysis applied to interview data, to describe the experiences of a wife and son caring for a husband\/father with semantic dementia. Using this approach, we identified four themes: (a) living with routines, (b) policing and protecting, (c) making connections, and (d) being adaptive and flexible. Each of these themes were shared and extended, with the importance of routines in everyday life highlighted. The implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed.

The study aims were to explore FPs' views regarding this issue, their role in providing dementia care, and the implications of providing dementia care in a rural setting. This study employed an exploratory qualitative design with a sample of 15 FPs. All rural FPs indicated acceptance of collaborative models. The main disadvantages of practicing rural were accessing urban-based health care and related services and a shortage of local health care resources. The primary benefit of practicing rural was FPs' social proximity to patients, families, and some health care workers. Rural FPs provided care for patients with dementia that took into account the emotional and practical needs of caregivers and families. FPs described positive and negative implications of rural dementia care, and all were receptive to models of care that included other health care professionals.

Doing so will allow them to develop theory rigorously and they will ultimately be able to better defend their final methodological destinations."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hunter","ForeName":"Andrew","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Midwifery, National University of Ireland, Galway. andrew.hunter@nuigalway.ie"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murphy","ForeName":"Kathy","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grealish","ForeName":"Annmarie","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Casey","ForeName":"Dympna","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Nurse Res","NlmUniqueID":"9435953","ISSNLinking":"1351-5578"},"CitationSubset":"N","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Nurse Res. 2011;19(1):4-5","PMID":"22128580"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Methodology Research","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22128581","10.7748\/nr2011.10.19.1.6.c8765"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21906232","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"01","Day":"18"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"12"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1466-769X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"12","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Nursing philosophy : an international journal for healthcare professionals","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Philos"},"ArticleTitle":"The 'demented other' or simply 'a person'?

Specifically, in this critique, we suggest that unwitting use of the adjective 'demented' to define a person living with the condition is ill-informed and runs a risk of defining people through negative (self-)attributes, which has a deleterious impact upon that person's social and relational personae. Moreover, use of the locution 'demented' reinforces a divide between the 'demented' (them) and the 'healthy others' (us). Social constructionist theory, malignant positioning and viewing people with dementia as semiotic subjects are the philosophical pillars through which we construct the main arguments of the critique. The article concludes with the voice of one of the authors, a younger person with dementia, asking for language in dementia care to be carefully reconsidered and reframed and for the recognition of the diagnosed person's agency in the conduct of their day-to-day lives.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sabat","ForeName":"Steven R","Initials":"SR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Johnson","ForeName":"Ann","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Swarbrick","ForeName":"Caroline","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Nurs Philos","NlmUniqueID":"100897394","ISSNLinking":"1466-7681"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude to Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication Barriers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Individuality"},{"DescriptorName":"Philosophy, Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Distance"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"Stereotyping"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21906232","10.1111\/j.1466-769X.2011.00485.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21727833","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"07","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0966-0461","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"12","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2011 Jun 24-Jul 7"}},"Title":"British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)","ISOAbbreviation":"Br J Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Alzheimer's or the normal course of ageing?","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"726"},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Older People's Mental Health Nursing, School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, University of Manchester."}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Br J Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9212059","ISSNLinking":"0966-0461"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"7","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"7","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21727833","10.12968\/bjon.2011.20.12.726"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Automated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21668545","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1365-2702","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"13-14","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Journal of clinical nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"J Clin Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Commentary on Cheung DSK, Chein WT & Lai CKY (2011) Conceptual framework for cognitive function enhancement in people with dementia.

Education for practitioners in risk management is particularly challenging because of its conceptual nature and diverse perceptions of risk between and within professional groups. The practice development research reported here formed one part of a multisite study and contributed to developing a risk assessment and management framework for use by practitioners in partnership with people with dementia and their families. Practice development research uses learning theories in the process of the research, and in so doing its intent is to not only create new knowledge but to view the research process as also a process of learning for those involved. Twenty practitioners from varying professions participated in five Collaborative Learning Groups, each of at least 2 hours duration, which were held over a 7-month period. Data analysis highlighted contradictions in the care system and in the professional's intention to practice in a person-centred way. These were expressed through the themes of: Seeking Certainty; Making Judgements; Team Working; Managing Complexity; Gathering and Using Information.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clarke","ForeName":"Charlotte L","Initials":"CL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Community, Health & Education Studies Research Centre, Coach Lane Campus, Northumbria University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. charlotte.clarke@northumbria.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcockson","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gibb","ForeName":"Catherine E","Initials":"CE"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilkinson","ForeName":"Heather","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Luce","ForeName":"Anna","Initials":"A"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"09","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Problem-Based Learning"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Management"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"4","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21143541","10.1111\/j.1365-2524.2010.00944.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21140883","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-0795","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Nursing older people","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Older People"},"ArticleTitle":"Investigating the causes of behaviours that challenge in people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"25-9"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Nurses are the main providers of care to older people and to people with dementia in a variety of settings, including acute hospitals.

Most attention has been given to pharmacological interventions, but there is increasing recognition that psychosocial interventions may be equally effective, even preferable where medication has negative side-effects. Reminiscence groups, run by professionals and volunteers, which use photographs, recordings and other objects to trigger personal memories are probably the most popular therapeutic approach to working with people with dementia, but there is little evidence for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The recent inclusion of family carers in groups with people with dementia, notably in our own pilot studies, has generated informal evidence that this joint approach improves relationships between people with dementia and their carers, and benefits both.","This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups for people with dementia and their family care-givers has two parallel arms--an intervention group and a control group who receive care as usual. The intervention consists of joint reminiscence groups held weekly for twelve consecutive weeks, followed by monthly maintenance sessions for a further seven months.The primary outcome measures are the quality of life of people with dementia, as assessed by QoL-AD, and their care-givers' mental health as assessed by the GHQ-28. Secondary outcomes include: the autobiographical memories of people with dementia; the quality of the relationship between them and their care-givers; and the levels of depression and anxiety felt by them and their care-giver. Using a 5% significance level, comparison of 200 pairs attending joint reminiscence groups with 200 pairs receiving usual treatment will yield 80% power to detect a standardised difference of 0.38 in the QoL-AD rated by the person with dementia and 0.28 in the GHQ-28 or carer-rated QoL-AD. The trial will include a cost-effectiveness analysis from a public sector perspective.","Our Cochrane review (2005) on reminiscence therapy for people with dementia did not identify any rigorous

intervention in dementia: developing practice through a single case history This paper reports on a single case history taken from the 'Dementia Action Research and Education' project, a 15-month primary care intervention study that was undertaken in North Wales in the early part of 2000. The study sought to address the meaning, context and diversity of early intervention in dementia care and employed a community mental health nurse and a psychiatric social worker to undertake early and psychosocial interventions with older people with dementia (aged 75 years and over) and their families. The workers tape-recorded, documented and analysed their interventions with 27 older people with dementia and their families over the 15-month duration of the study. Clinical supervision was also undertaken during the intervention phase. One case history is presented in this paper to illustrate the work of the community mental health nurse and to identify areas of practice development. Greater role transparency, collaborative working and improvement in educational preparation for practice are called for."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Northumbria University, School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Studies, University of Wales Bangor, Gwynedd, UK. j.keady@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Bob","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hahn","ForeName":"Sue","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hill","ForeName":"Jim","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Clin Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9207302","ISSNLinking":"0962-1067"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude to Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Health Nursing","QualifierName":["education","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Community Mental Health Services","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Cooperative Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interprofessional Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Needs Assessment"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse Clinicians","QualifierName":["education","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse's Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Evaluation Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Methodology Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing, Supervisory","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Nursing","QualifierName":["education","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Spouses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Time Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Wales"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"2","Day":"24","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"3","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"2","Day":"24","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15724820","10.1111\/j.1365-2702.2004.01045.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15271637","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"02"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0002-0729","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"33","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"General practitioners' knowledge, confidence and attitudes in the diagnosis and management of dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"461-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To measure general practitioners' knowledge of, confidence with and attitudes to the diagnosis and management of dementia in primary care.","20 general practices of varying size and prior research experience in Central Scotland, and 16 similarly varied practices in north London.","127 general practitioners who had volunteered to join a randomised controlled trial of educational interventions about dementia diagnosis and management.","Self-completion questionnaires covering knowledge, confidence and attitudes were retrieved from practitioners prior to the educational interventions.","General practitioners' knowledge of dementia diagnosis and management is good, but poor awareness of its epidemiology leads to an over-estimate of caseload. Knowledge of local diagnostic and support services is less good, and one third of general practitioners expressed limited confidence in their diagnostic skills, whilst two-thirds lacked confidence in management of behaviour and other problems in dementia. The main difficulties identified by general practitioners were talking with patients about the diagnosis, responding to behaviour problems and coordinating support services. General practitioners perceived lack of time and lack of social services support as the major obstacles to good quality care more often than they identified their own unfamiliarity with current management or with local resources. Attitudes to the disclosure of the diagnosis, and to the potential for improving the quality of life of patients and carers varied, but a third of general practitioners believed that dementia care is within a specialist's domain, not that of general practice. More experienced and male general practitioners were more pessimistic about dementia care, as were general practitioners with lower knowledge about dementia. Those reporting greater difficulty with dementia diagnosis and management and those with lower knowledge scores were also less likely to express attitudes endorsing open communication with patient and carer.","Educational support for general practitioners should concentrate on epidemiological knowledge, disclosure of the diagnosis and management of behaviour problems in dementia.

Disciplines represented by this sample were predominantly district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses and community staff nurses. Each practitioner was administered an extensive self-completion questionnaire before the educational interventions were introduced to measure baseline knowledge, confidence and perceived difficulties in dementia care management and attitudes. Results from the quiz indicate lower levels of knowledge about epidemiology and diagnosis, but slightly higher levels about management strategies. Self-reported ratings of confidence were also low and were directly related to ratings of difficulty in identifying dementia and dealing with coexisting behavioural and mental health problems.
