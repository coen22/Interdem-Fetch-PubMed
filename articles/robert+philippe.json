The WHO \"encounter form,\" a standardized schedule that enables data concerning basic socio-demographic, clinical, and pathways data to be gathered, was completed for each participant.","The median time from the appearance of the first symptoms to the first contact with specialist dementia care was 56 weeks. The primary point of access to care was the general practitioners (55.8%). Psychiatrists, geriatricians, and neurologists represented the most important second point of access. In about a third of cases, PwD were prescribed psychotropic drugs (mostly antidepressants and tranquillizers). Psychosocial interventions (such as psychological counselling, psychotherapy, and practical advice) were delivered in less than 3% of situations. The analyses of the \"pathways diagram\" revealed that the path of PwD to receiving care is complex and diverse across countries and that there are important barriers to clinical care.","The study of pathways followed by PwD to reach specialized care has implications for the subsequent course and the outcome of dementia. Insights into local differences in the clinical presentations and the implementation of currently available dementia care are essential to develop more tailored strategies for these patients, locally, nationally, and internationally."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Volpe","ForeName":"Umberto","Initials":"U","Identifier":"0000-0001-9166-7609","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neuroscience\/DIMSC, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Amin","ForeName":"Hania","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Research and Training, Institute of Psychiatry, Rawalpindi, Pakistan."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ayinde","ForeName":"Olatunde O","Initials":"OO","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health, Neurosciences and Drug and Alcohol abuse, Department of Psychiatry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Nigeria."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burns","ForeName":"Alistair","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Greater Manchester NIHR Clinical Research Network, University of Manchester, UK, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chan","ForeName":"Wai Chi","Initials":"WC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"David","ForeName":"Renaud","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CoBTEK lab, Research Memory center, University C\u00f4te d'Azur, Nice, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dejanovic","ForeName":"Slavica Djukic","Initials":"SD","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinic for Mental Disorders, Belgrade, Serbia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Djokic","ForeName":"Gorica","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinic for Mental Disorders, Belgrade, Serbia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eraslan","ForeName":"Defne","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Istanbul Psikiyatri Enstitusu, Istanbul, Turkey."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fischer","ForeName":"Giulia A L","Initials":"GAL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Old Age Psychiatry, Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gracia-Garc\u00eda","ForeName":"Patricia","Initials":"P","Identifier":"0000-0001-9822-6312","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Medicine and Psychiatry, University of Zaragoza;

In the combined electronic clinical records database of 11 French expert memory centres, a diagnosis of prodromal or mild AD, certified by the use of cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, could be established in 195 (1.3%) out of 14 596 patients.","AD was not frequently diagnosed at a prodromal or mild dementia stage in France in 2014 to 2018. Diagnosis rarely relied on a pathophysiological marker even in expert memory centres. National databases will be valuable to monitor early stage AD diagnosis efficacy in memory centres when a disease-modifying treatment becomes available."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the impact of CSF biomarkers in MCI populations in clinical practice has been poorly evaluated. The objective of this study is to assess the use and impact in clinical practice of AD CSF biomarkers in French memory clinics.","We performed a nation-wide, prospective survey between March 2012 and September 2014. Data over the same period was extracted from the French National Database (Banque Nationale Alzheimer, BNA) and compared with the results of the survey.","29 secondary and tertiary memory clinics in France.","Clinicians prescribing lumbar puncture (LP) in order to measure AD CSF biomarkers. Clinicians completed a two-part questionnaire for each of their patients undergoing LP.","Assessment of diagnosis, level of confidence before and after CSF biomarkers and impact on management in patients who underwent LP for CSF AD biomarkers in clinical routine.","977 questionnaires were completed, of which 61 were excluded because of unknown initial\/final diagnosis or non-contributory CSF results. Of 916 patients reported, 153 (16.7%) had MCI as the initial diagnosis, of which 51 (33.3%) displayed an AD profile. CSF biomarkers resulted in a change in diagnosis in 44 patients (28.8%). Confidence level significantly increased after LP (8.3\u00b11.4vs 6.73\u00b11.18, p<0.0001), and CSF results modified management in 71\/156 patients (46.4%), including 36 (23.5%) enrolled in clinical trials. Comparison of change in diagnosis with the BNA population revealed no difference (32.24%, p=0.4).","This nation-wide survey, reflecting clinical practice in French memory clinics, describes the impact of CSF AD biomarkers in patients with MCI in clinical practice."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its precursor Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is well known. Yet, it remains open whether this impairment mirrors the breakdown of semantic memory retrieval processes or executive control processes. Therefore, qualitative analysis of the SVF has been proposed but is limited in terms of methodology and feasibility in clinical practice. Consequently, research draws no conclusive picture which of these afore-mentioned processes drives the SVF impairment in AD and MCI. This study uses a qualitative computational approach-combining temporal and semantic information-to investigate exploitation and exploration patterns as indicators for semantic memory retrieval and executive control processes. Audio SVF recordings of 20 controls (C, 66-81 years), 55 MCI (57-94 years) and 20 AD subjects (66-82 years) were assessed while groups were matched according to age and education. All groups produced, on average, the same amount of semantically related items in rapid succession within word clusters. Conversely, towards AD, there was a clear decline in semantic as well as temporal exploration patterns between clusters. Results strongly point towards preserved exploitation-semantic memory retrieval processes-and hampered exploration-executive control processes-in AD and potentially in MCI.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these are necessary to adapt healthcare policy in terms of prevention, care and social needs related to this condition. To estimate the prevalence rate in the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera, with a population of one million, we present a capture-recapture procedure applied to cases of Alzheimer's disease, based on two epidemiological surveillance systems.","To estimate the total number of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease, a capture-recapture study included a cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease or receiving medications only eligible for use for this condition, recorded by a specific health insurance information system (Health Insurance Cohort, HIC), and those registered in the French National Alzheimer's Data Bank (\"Banque Nationale Alzheimer\", BNA) in 2010 and 2011. We applied Bayesian estimation of the Mt ecological model, taking into account age and gender as covariates, i.e. factors of inhomogeneous catchability.","Overall, 5,562 patients with Alzheimer's disease were recorded, of whom only 856 were common to both information systems. Mean age and F\/M sex ratio differed between BNA and HIC surveillance systems, 81 vs 84 years and 2.7 vs 3.2, respectively. A Bayesian estimation, with age and gender as covariates, yields an estimate of 15,060 cases of Alzheimer's disease [95%HPDI: 14,490-15,630] in the Alpes-Maritimes. The completeness of the HIC and BNA databases were respectively of 25.4% and 17.2%.

domains. They can be either an enabler or an obstacle leading to social exclusion. The Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer gathered international experts of dementia care, with backgrounds in biomedical, human and social sciences, to analyze how assistive technologies can address the capabilities of people with dementia, on the basis of their needs. Discussion covered the unmet needs of people with dementia, the domains of daily life activities where assistive technologies can provide help to people with dementia, the enabling and empowering impact of technology to improve their safety and wellbeing, barriers and limits of use, technology assessment, ethical and legal issues. The capability approach (possible freedom) appears particularly relevant in person-centered dementia care and technology development. The focus is not on the solution, rather on what the person can do with it: seeing dementia as disability, with technology as an enabler to promote capabilities of the person, provides a useful framework for both research and practice. This article summarizes how these concepts took momentum in professional practice and public policies in the past 15 years (2000-2015), discusses current issues in the design, development and economic model of assistive technologies for people with dementia, and covers how these technologies are being used and assessed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kenigsberg","ForeName":"Paul-Ariel","Initials":"PA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aquino","ForeName":"Jean-Pierre","Initials":"JP","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"B\u00e9rard","ForeName":"Alain","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Br\u00e9mond","ForeName":"Fran\u00e7ois","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CoBTeK Lab & INRIA STARS, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te-d'Azur, Nice, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charras","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dro\u00ebs","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gzil","ForeName":"Fabrice","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hicks","ForeName":"Ben","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bournemouth University Dementia Institute, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Salford Institute for Dementia University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nguyen","ForeName":"Sao-Mai","Initials":"SM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Lab-STICC, Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pino","ForeName":"Maribel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Laboratoire Lusage, H\u00f4pital Broca, Assistance publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sacco","ForeName":"Guillaume","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche, CHU de Nice;

The type of dementia did not have any influence on AP prescribing.","An increase in AP prescribing among individuals with dementia in French specialized settings over the last 5\u00a0years occurred despite safety warnings. This phenomenon suggests that alternative solutions for the management of behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in these populations are still urgently needed."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tifratene","ForeName":"Karim","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"EA

dysregulation affects Alzheimer's disease (AD), we compared the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin and histamine\/tele-methylhistamine (HA\/t-MHA) levels of 82 patients (41 probable-AD-high level of evidence, 41 mild cognitive impairment MCI-due-to-AD), 24 other neurologic disorders (OND) and 24 controls. We determined the relationships between these biomarkers, the CSF AD biomarkers concentrations, and the clinical sleep profile. CSF orexin-A but not HA\/t-MHA levels were higher in MCI and AD than OND and controls. CSF orexin-A is correlated to CSF amyloid-\u03b2in MCI and AD, independently of age, gender, MMSE, total-tau\/phosphorylated-tau, HA or sleep parameters. Nighttime sleep duration was longer in MCI and AD patients than controls. In MCI, nighttime sleep duration negatively correlated with CSF amyloid-\u03b2 and MMSE. To conclude, CSF orexin-A but not HA\/t-HMA was upregulated in AD and correlated with amyloid-\u03b2 level. Our data suggested a change in the sleep-wake pattern at an early stage of the disease that needs further investigation to deeply explain the mechanistic interplay between sleep and Alzheimer.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Centers.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1459-1471"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Few demographical data about primary progressive aphasia (PPA) are available, and most knowledge regarding PPA is based on tertiary centers' results.","Our aims were to describe demographical characteristics of the PPA population in a large sample of PPA patients from the network of French Alzheimer plan memory centers (Sample 1), and to describe the stratification of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in two different samples of PPA patients (Samples 2 and 3).","All registered PPA patients in the French Alzheimer's disease (AD) databank (Sample 1: n\u200a=\u200a2,035) and a subsample (Sample 2: n\u200a=\u200a65) derived from a multicentric prospective cohort with CSF biomarker analysis were analyzed. A multicentric retrospective cohort from language expert tertiary centers (Sample 3: n\u200a=\u200a97) with CSF biomarker analysis was added. Sample 3 was added to replicate the CSF results of the Sample 2 and to evaluate repartition of AD pathology in the three variant of PPA according to the latest classification.","Non-Fluent\/Agrammatic, Logopenic, and Unclassifiable PPA patients (NF\/A-Logo-Unclass PPA) were older and more frequent than Semantic PPA patients (2.2 versus 0.8\/100,000 inhabitants; p\u200a<\u200a0.00001). Male predominance occurred after the age of 80 (p\u200a<\u200a0.00001). A higher level of education was observed in the PPA population compared to a typical amnesic AD group. No demographical significant difference between PPA due to AD and not due to AD was observed. The Logopenic variant was most frequent with 85% of AD CSF biomarker profiles (35% in NF\/A PPA; 20% in Semantic PPA).","PPA occurs also in an elderly population, especially in male patients over 80. CSF biomarkers are useful to stratify PPA. The epidemiology of PPA should be further investigated to confirm gender and cognitive reserve role in PPA to better understand the factors and mechanisms leading to this language-predominant deficit during neurodegenerative diseases."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Magnin","ForeName":"Eloi","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche (CMRR), H\u00f4pital Universitaire de Besan\u00e7on, Besan\u00e7on, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"D\u00e9monet","ForeName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","Initials":"JF","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre Leenaards de la M\u00e9moire, CHUV, Lausanne, Suisse."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wallon","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Service de Neurologie, H\u00f4pital universitaire de Rouen, et INSERM UMR1079, Universit\u00e9 de Rouen, Rouen, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dumurgier","ForeName":"Julien","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche (CMRR), Paris Nord Ile de France, APHP, Paris, France."},{"Affiliation":"INSERM U942, Paris, France."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Troussi\u00e8re","ForeName":"Anne-C\u00e9cile","Initials":"AC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Inserm 1171, Univ.

However, so far, no SeG targeting EE has been tested in ND subjects.","This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.","X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft\u00ae Kinect\u2122. 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability.","All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game.","Usability results suggest that X-Torp represents a usable EE for healthy subjects and persons with MCI and AD. However, in order to reach moderate or high intensity of aerobic activity, X-Torp control modes should be adapted to become more physically stimulating."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ben-Sadoun","ForeName":"Gr\u00e9gory","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"EA

therapy and rehabilitation, and has recently attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians working with elderly people with MCI, Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Here we present a study testing the feasibility of using highly realistic image-based rendered VR with patients with MCI and dementia. We designed an attentional task to train selective and sustained attention, and we tested a VR and a paper version of this task in a single-session within-subjects design. Results showed that participants with MCI and dementia reported to be highly satisfied and interested in the task, and they reported high feelings of security, low discomfort, anxiety and fatigue. In addition, participants reported a preference for the VR condition compared to the paper condition, even if the task was more difficult. Interestingly, apathetic participants showed a preference for the VR condition stronger than that of non-apathetic participants. These findings suggest that VR-based training can be considered as an interesting tool to improve adherence to cognitive training in elderly people with cognitive impairment.

disease, few large scale randomized trials involving a long-term intervention and several cognitive-oriented approaches have been carried out. ETNA3 trial compares the effect of cognitive training, reminiscence therapy, and an individualized cognitive rehabilitation program in Alzheimer's disease to usual care.","This is a multicenter (40 French clinical sites) randomized, parallel-group trial, with a two-year follow-up comparing groups receiving standardized programs of cognitive training (group sessions), reminiscence therapy (group sessions), individualized cognitive rehabilitation program (individual sessions), and usual care (reference group). Six hundred fifty-three outpatients with Alzheimer's disease were recruited. The primary efficacy outcome was the rate of survival without moderately severe to severe dementia at two years. Secondary outcomes were cognitive impairment, functional disability, behavioral disturbance, apathy, quality of life, depression, caregiver's burden, and resource utilization.","No impact on the primary efficacy measure was evidenced. For the two group interventions (i.e. cognitive training and reminiscence), none of the secondary outcomes differed from usual care. The larger effect was seen with individualized cognitive rehabilitation in which significantly lower functional disability and a six-month delay in institutionalization at two years were evidenced.","These findings challenge current management practices of Alzheimer's patients. While cognitive-oriented group therapies have gained popularity, this trial does not show improvement for the patients.

dementia (BPSD), affect the majority of patients with dementia, and result in a greater cognitive and functional impairment.","To investigate associations between BPSD and amyloid cerebral deposition as measured by 18F-Florbetapir-PET quantitative uptake in elderly subjects with and without cognitive impairment.","Participants with cognitive impairment [mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD)] and healthy controls (HC) from the ADNI cohort (Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) who underwent an 18F-florbetapir PET scan between May 2010 and March 2014 were included. Clinical assessments included the Clinical Dementia Rating, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Freesurfer software was used to extract PET counts based on T1-based structural ROI (frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal). Spearman's partial correlation scores between BPSD severity and regional amyloid uptake were calculated.","Data for 657 participants [age\u200a=\u200a72.6 (7.19); MMSE\u200a=\u200a27.4 (2.67)] were analyzed, including 230 HC [age\u200a=\u200a73.1 (6.02); MMSE\u200a=\u200a29 (1.21)], 308 MCI [age\u200a=\u200a71.5 (7.44); MMSE\u200a=\u200a28.0 (1.75)], and 119 AD subjects [age\u200a=\u200a74.7 (8.05); MMSE\u200a=\u200a23.1 (2.08)].

To understand them better, the Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer has brought together a multi-disciplinary expert group. Aristote's five senses must be enhanced by today's knowledge of proprioception, motor cognition and pain perception. When cognition breaks down, the person with dementia perceives the world around her with her sensory experience, yet is unable to integrate all this information to understand the context. The treatment of multiple sensory inputs by the brain is closely linked to cognitive processes. Sensory deficits reduce considerably the autonomy of people with dementia in their daily life and their relations with others, increase their social isolation and the risk of accidents. Professionals involved with neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly aware of sensory deficits, which can bias the results of cognitive tests. However, there are simple tools to detect these deficits, notably for vision, hearing and balance disorders, which can be corrected. Many interventions for cognitive rehabilitation or quality of life improvement are based on sensory functions. The environment of people with dementia must be adapted to become understandable, comfortable, safe and eventually therapeutic.

Among 446,439 patients cared for in the participating centers between January 2009 and January 2014, 45,386 (10.2%) were classified as having MCI and 23,676 had at least one follow-up visit. Annual progression rate was used to describe the progression of patients with MCI to dementia due to Alzheimer disease. Hazard ratios of dementia due to Alzheimer disease were estimated using Cox regression model.","Annual progression rate (95% confidence interval) was 13.7% person-years (py) (13.5%-13.9%) with higher rate for amnestic MCI (aMCI) (18.2% py [17.9%-18.5%]) than for nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) (9.5% py [9.3%-9.6%]). Separate regression models were performed for each MCI subtype. Higher education, older age, female sex, and lower Mini-Mental State Examination score were associated with an increased risk of progression for both subtypes. Use of anxiolytics (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.77 [0.66-0.91]) was a protective factor for aMCI whereas antidepressant drugs (1.16 [1.04-1.29]) were associated with an increased risk. For naMCI, prescriptions of antidepressants (0.85 [0.74-0.98]) and antipsychotics (0.55 [0.32-0.93]) were protective for progression.","Under circumstances emulating routine clinical practice, the positive predictive value of an MCI diagnosis is in line with previous clinical studies and the external validity of the concept is strengthened.

Principal challenges include a paucity of data regarding apathy in these disorders, an absence of established diagnostic criteria, the presence of confounding factors (eg, coexisting depression), use of concomitant medications, and an absence of a gold-standard apathy assessment scale. Based on a literature search and ongoing collaboration among the authors, we present recommendations for the design of future clinical trials of apathy, suggesting Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease as models with relevance across a wider array of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recommendations address clarification of the targeted study population (apathy diagnosis and severity at baseline), confounding factors (mood\/cognition, behavior, and treatment), outcome measures, study duration, use of comparators and considerations around environment, and the role of the caregiver and patient assent. This review contributes to the search for an optimal approach to study treatment of apathy in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Level of education and cognitive reserve assessment in neuropsychological testing deserve attention, as well as cultural, social, and economic aspects of caregiving. Assistive technologies for dementia care remain complex. Serious games are emerging as virtual educational and pleasurable tools, designed for individual and cooperative skill building. Public policies are likely to pursue improving awareness and understanding of dementia; providing good quality early diagnosis and intervention for all; improving quality of care from diagnosis to the end of life, using clinical and economic end points; delivering dementia strategies quicker, with an impact on more people. Dementia should remain presented as a stand-alone concept, distinct from frailty or loss of autonomy. The basic science of sensory impairment and social engagement in people with dementia needs to be developed. E-learning and serious games programs may enhance public and professional education. Faced with funding shortage, new professional dynamics and economic models may emerge through coordinated, flexible research networks. Psychosocial research could be viewed as an investment in quality of care, rather than an academic achievement in a few centers of excellence. This would help provide a competitive advantage to the best operators. Stemming from care needs, a logical, systems approach to dementia care environment through organizational, architectural, and psychosocial interventions may be developed, to help reduce symptoms in people with dementia and enhance quality of life. Dementia-friendly environments, culture, and domesticity are key factors for such interventions.

This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease. This paper also elaborates on the specific diagnostic criteria for atypical forms of AD, for mixed AD, and for the preclinical states of AD.

These biomarkers are used in routine practice according to Health Authority Recommendations. In 604 consecutive patients explored for cognitive disorders, questionnaires were prospectively proposed and filled. Before and after CSF biomarker results, clinicians provided a diagnosis and an estimate of their diagnostic confidence. Analysis has compared the frequency of diagnosis before and after CSF biomarker results using the net reclassification improvement (NRI) method. We have evaluated external validity comparing with data of French Bank National of AD (BNA). A total of 561 patients [Alzheimer's disease (AD), n = 253; non-AD, n = 308] were included (mean age, 68.6 years; women, 52 %). Clinically suspected diagnosis and CSF results were concordant in 65.2 % of cases. When clinical hypothesis and biological results were discordant, a reclassification occurred in favour of CSF biomarkers results in 76.9 %. The NRI was 39.5 %. In addition, the results show a statistically significant improvement in clinician confidence for their diagnosis. In comparison with BNA data, patients were younger and more frequently diagnosed with AD. Clinicians tend to heavily rely on the CSF AD biomarkers results and are more confident in their diagnoses using CSF AD biomarkers. Thus, these biomarkers appear as a key tool in clinical practice."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mouton-Liger","ForeName":"Fran\u00e7ois","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

Each participant was asked to undertake a set of daily tasks in the setting of a \"smart home\" equipped with two video cameras and everyday objects for use in activities of daily living (8 IADLs for P1 and 11 for P2, plus 4 temporal execution constraints). The DAS score was then computed from quantitative and qualitative parameters collected from video recordings.","In P1, the DAS score differentiated AD (DAS(AD,P1) = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.56) from NC (DAS(NC,P1) = 0.71, 95% CI 0.68-0.74). In P2, the DAS score differentiated MCI (DAS(MCI,P2) = 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.16) and NC (DAS(NC,P2) = 0.36, 95% CI 0.26-0.45).","In conclusion, this study outlines the interest of a novel tool coming from the ICT world for the assessment of functional impairment in AD and MCI. The derived DAS scores provide a pragmatic, ecological, objective measurement which may improve the prediction of future dementia, be used as an outcome measurement in clinical trials and lead to earlier therapeutic intervention."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sacco","ForeName":"Guillaume","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"EA

stimulation (DBS). This propriety might be used to slow down cognitive decline in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of DBS in AD patients with mild cognitive decline. Inclusion criteria were: patients (<70 years old) with AD diagnosed for less than 2 years, predominant impairment of episodic memory, and Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score between 20 and 24. The fornix was stimulated bilaterally by electrodes implanted stereotactically in the hypothalamus. Clinical, biological, neuropsychological, and imaging evaluations were conducted 3 months before surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter. During the one year-period of inclusion, 110 patients with recently diagnosed AD and predominant impairment of episodic memory were screened. Only 9 patients (8.2%) fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Finally, just one patient accepted to be operated (acceptance rate 11.1%) and completed the study. No complications occurred and the stimulation was perfectly tolerated. After one year of stimulation, the memory scores (MMSE, ADAS-Cog, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) were stabilized compared to baseline, and mesial temporal lobes metabolism increased. This pilot study provides new data about the safety of fornix DBS in the hypothalamus. However, it suggests that only a small proportion of AD patients might be interested in this approach and that the acceptance of DBS by AD patients was low, raising questions about the relevance of this approach to meet the expectations of these patients."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fontaine","ForeName":"Denys","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Service de Neurochirurgie, CHU de Nice, Nice, France. fontaine.d@chu-nice.fr."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deudon","ForeName":"Audrey","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lemaire","ForeName":"Jean Jacques","Initials":"JJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Razzouk","ForeName":"Micheline","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Viau","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Darcourt","ForeName":"Jacques","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0Z5B2CJX4D","NameOfSubstance":"Fluorodeoxyglucose F18"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"J Alzheimers Dis. 2013;34(1):295-6","PMID":"23171574"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Deep Brain Stimulation","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Feasibility Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Fluorodeoxyglucose F18"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Status Schedule"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Positron-Emission Tomography"},{"DescriptorName":"Time Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"9","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23168448","KV277R3738267673","10.3233\/JAD-121579"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22959217","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1474-4465","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"11","Issue":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"The Lancet.

In a cross-sectional observational study of 734 subjects with probable mild AD, we evaluated the prevalence of apathy and depression. After the use of specific diagnostic criteria, we tested the interaction between the two syndromes and their relation with specific comorbidities, and different functional outcomes. Depression was diagnosed using the diagnostic criteria for depression in AD, and apathy with the diagnostic criteria for apathy in neuropsychiatric disorders. According to the specific diagnostic criteria, depression had a 47.9% prevalence, while apathy prevalence was 41.6%. Apathy and depression were associated in 32.4% of patients (n = 225). 9.4% (n = 65) had only apathy, 15.4% (n = 107) had only depression, and 42.9% had no apathy and no depression (n = 298). The three most frequent depressive symptoms were fatigue or loss of energy (59.4%), decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contacts and activities (46.2%), and psychomotor agitation or retardation (36.9%). Concerning apathy, loss of goal-directed cognition was the most frequently altered (63.6%), followed by loss of goal-directed action (60.6%) and loss of goal-directed emotion (43.8%). Patients with both apathy and depression more frequently required a resource allowance for dependency. Neurological comorbidities were more frequent in the \"apathy and depression\" and \"depression alone\" groups (p < 0.001). Apathy and depression overlap considerably, and this might be explained by the presence of some non-specific symptoms in both diagnostic criteria.

The ROSA and four standard instruments -- the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog), Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) -- were used in an open-label, multicenter, single-arm clinical study to assess treatment-induced changes in cognitive, functional, and behavioral symptoms in patients with AD at different severity stages.","A total of 451 patients were treated with memantine (initiated at 5 mg\/day and up-titrated with 5 mg weekly to a final dose of 20 mg\/day) for 12 weeks. The study endpoints comprised changes from baseline in the scores of the ROSA, ADAS-cog, SIB, DAD, and NPI as well as global changes on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C). Analyses were performed for the overall population and by AD severity stage (early, middle, late).","The ROSA scores increased significantly after a 12-week treatment in all study groups except for early stage. Mean changes in the ADAS-cog score indicated a trend towards worsening in early and middle stages. Non-significant changes were shown by the SIB, NPI, and DAD assessments at week 12. The CGI-C demonstrated 'minimal improvement' or 'no change' for most of the patients. Overall, memantine treatment was safe and well tolerated.","The results demonstrated the ROSA feasibility in daily practice for assessment of memantine effects over time in patients with moderate and late AD."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holthoff","ForeName":"Vjera","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"DZNE, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Dresden, and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, University of Technology, Dresden, Germany.

collect data from all memory centers (memory units, memory resource and research centers, independent neurologists) throughout the country. Here we describe the French Alzheimer Information System and present a 'snapshot' of the data collected throughout the country during the first year of operation. We analyzed all data transmitted by memory centers between January 2010 and December 2010. Each participating center is required to transmit information on patients to the French National Alzheimer dataBank (BNA). This involves completing a computer file containing 31 variables corresponding to a limited data set on AD (CIMA: Corpus minimum d'information Alzheimer). In 2010, the BNA received data from 320 memory centers relating to 199,113 consultations involving 118,776 patients. An analysis of the data shows that the initial MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) mean score for patients in France was 16.8 points for Alzheimer's disease, 25.7 points for mild cognitive impairment, and 18.8 points for 'related disorders related disorders. The BNA will provide longitudinal data that can be used to assess the needs of individual local health areas and size specialized care provision in each regional health scheme. By contributing to the BNA, the memory centers enhance their clinical activity and help to advance knowledge in epidemiology and medical research in the important field of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Le

overcome the issue of heterogeneity of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to better define patients in early stage AD. Only few therapeutic trials, if any, have been reported using this newly defined population. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a novel pro-cholinergic drug (V0191) in patients with prodromal AD. Two hundred forty two (242) patients with a diagnosis of prodromal AD were randomized in an approximately 1 : 1 ratio to receive either 1500 mg V0191 or matching placebo once daily for 24 weeks. Changes in global cognitive functioning were assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog; responder rate as primary efficacy measure). Standardized measures of memory, executive function, attention, functional capacity, and apathy were also obtained. Despite some interesting trends at week 12 and conversion rates favoring V0191, no statistically significant differences in cognitive function between V0191 and placebo were noted. In addition to the absence of drug efficacy on this population, several design features may have hindered this study, including insufficient powering to assess changes in cognition over time, a relatively short duration of treatment, and the lack of validated clinical trial measures designed to assess the prodromal AD population. Lessons learned in AD study design optimization, including those presented in this paper, could be valuable for further investigation with pro-cholinergic drugs such as V0191."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dubois","ForeName":"Bruno","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Memory and Alzheimer's Disease, ICM, UMR-S975, AP-HP, Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital Group, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France. bruno.dubois@psl.aphp.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zaim","ForeName":"Mohammed","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Touchon","ForeName":"Jacques","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vellas","ForeName":"Bruno","Initials":"B"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murphy","ForeName":"Michael F","Initials":"MF"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pujadas-Navin\u00e9s","ForeName":"Francesc","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rainer","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Soininen","ForeName":"Hilkka","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Riordan","ForeName":"Henry J","Initials":"HJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kanony-Truc","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinergic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Glutamates"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"dimethylaminoethanol pyroglutamate"},{"RegistryNumber":"2N6K9DRA24","NameOfSubstance":"Deanol"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Analysis of Variance"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinergic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Deanol","QualifierName":["analogs & derivatives","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Double-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Glutamates","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"International Cooperation"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Retrospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22330824","3GH154235281230X","10.3233\/JAD-2012-111370"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22039732","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0035-2640","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"61","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"La Revue du praticien","ISOAbbreviation":"Rev Prat"},"ArticleTitle":"[Treatment of behavioral disorders in Alzheimer's disease].","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"939-44"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are now known to be frequently associated to cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.

Studies using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) have found that apathy is present in up to 70% of individuals with Alzheimer disease. One of the main difficulties in assessing apathy and other neuropsychiatric symptoms is the absence of reliable, objective measures. Motor activity assessment using ambulatory actigraphy could provide an indirect, objective evaluation of apathy. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between apathy and daytime motor activity in AD, using ambulatory actigraphy.","One hundred seven AD outpatients wore a wrist actigraph (Motionlogger) during seven consecutive 24-hour periods to evaluate motor activity. Participants were divided into two subgroups according to their apathy subscores on the NPI: individuals with apathy (NPI-apathy subscores >4) and those without. Daytime mean motor activity scores were compared between the two subgroups.","Individuals with AD who had symptoms of apathy (n = 43; age = 79 \u00b1 4.7 years; Mini-Mental State Examination = 20.9 \u00b1 4.8) had significantly lower daytime mean motor activity than AD patients without apathy (n = 64; age = 76.3 \u00b1 7.7; Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.5 \u00b1 4.7), while nighttime mean motor activity did not significantly differ between the two subgroups.","Ambulatory actigraphy could be added to currently used questionnaires as a simple, objective technique for assessing apathy in the routine assessment of AD patients."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"David","ForeName":"Renaud","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources de Recherche, Nice University Hospital, Nice, France. david.r@chu-nice.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mulin","ForeName":"Emmanuel","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Friedman","ForeName":"Leah","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Le Duff","ForeName":"Franck","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cygankiewicz","ForeName":"Edyta","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deschaux","ForeName":"Olivier","Initials":"O"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Garcia","ForeName":"Rene","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Yesavage","ForeName":"Jerome A","Initials":"JA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zeitzer","ForeName":"Jamie M","Initials":"JM"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"9309609","ISSNLinking":"1064-7481"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Actigraphy","QualifierName":["methods","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Apathy","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Motor Activity","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Photoperiod"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"1","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21997602","10.1097\/JGP.0b013e31823038af","S1064-7481(12)61998-8"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21914671","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1938-2731","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"26","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen"},"ArticleTitle":"Validity, reliability, and feasibility of clinical staging scales in dementia: a systematic review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"357-65"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1533317511418954","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"New staging systems of dementia require adaptation of disease management programs and adequate staging instruments.

learning (EL) and learning by modeling (LM) were more advantageous than trial and error learning (TEL) in the acquisition of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients (n = 14). Using a counterbalanced within-subject design, participants performed 3 learning conditions. EL consisted of straightforward prompts before any action, LM focused on the modeling of each step of the tasks and standard TEL without cues was used as a control condition. The participants had to (re)learn 3 IADL. Repeated-measure analyses during learning and follow-up assessments were performed 1 and 3 weeks after learning. The LM and the EL procedures resulted in significantly better learning compared to TEL, with effect sizes (partial eta squared) of 0.42 and 0.35, respectively. This is the first controlled study to show that (re)learning of IADL is possible in patients with AD using an error-reduction approach."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dechamps","ForeName":"Arnaud","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatrics and Alzheimer Centre Nijmegen, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fasotti","ForeName":"Luciano","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jungheim","ForeName":"Jeltine","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leone","ForeName":"Elsa","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dood","ForeName":"Erna","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Allioux","ForeName":"Apolline","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gervais","ForeName":"Xavier","Initials":"X"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Maubourguet","ForeName":"Nathalie","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Olde Rikkert","ForeName":"Marcel G M","Initials":"MG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kessels","ForeName":"Roy P C","Initials":"RP"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"04","Day":"17"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen","NlmUniqueID":"101082834","ISSNLinking":"1533-3175"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cues"},{"DescriptorName":"France"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Learning","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"4","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"4","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21502092","1533317511404394","10.1177\/1533317511404394"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21384431","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"01","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"21"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Detecting treatment effects with combinations of the ADAS-cog items in patients with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"15-21"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.2679","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["When complex cognitive functions are measured with multi-item scales like the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), it seems valuable information can be lost due to combination of the ADAS-cog items results into a total score.

Both apathy and sleep disorders are known to have independent negative effects on the quality of life in individuals with AD. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between apathy and sleep\/wake patterns in individuals with AD using ambulatory actigraphy. One hundred and three non-institutionalized individuals with AD wore a wrist actigraph continuously over seven consecutive 24-h periods. Apathy was assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Daytime mean motor activity (dMMA) was calculated from daytime wrist actigraphy data. Actigraphic parameters of sleep included total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), time in bed (TIB), WASO normalized by TIB, sleep latency, and nighttime mean motor activity (nMMA). Among the 103 individuals with AD (aged 76.9 \u00b1 7.2 years; MMSE = 21.4 \u00b1 4.3), those with apathy had significantly lower dMMA, higher WASO (both raw and normalized), and spent more time in bed during the night than those without apathy. Sleep latency, nMMA and TST did not differ significantly between the two subgroups. To our knowledge, this study is the first to identify a relationship between apathy and sleep disturbance in those with mild or moderate AD: apathy was associated with increased TIB during the night and more WASO. These results suggest that AD patients with apathy have less consolidated nocturnal sleep than those without apathy."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mulin","ForeName":"Emmanuel","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche, CHU, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France. mulin.e@chu-nice.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zeitzer","ForeName":"Jamie M","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Friedman","ForeName":"Leah","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Le Duff","ForeName":"Franck","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Yesavage","ForeName":"Jerome","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"David","ForeName":"Renaud","Initials":"R"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Actigraphy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Apathy","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Polysomnography","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Sleep Wake Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"2","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"6","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21335662","K301U34W18W5U4L4","10.3233\/JAD-2011-101701"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"20934914","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"11","Day":"16"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1474-4465","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"9","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"The Lancet.

The recent advances in use of reliable biomarkers of AD that provide in-vivo evidence of the disease has stimulated the development of new research criteria that reconceptualise the diagnosis around both a specific pattern of cognitive changes and structural\/biological evidence of Alzheimer's pathology. This new diagnostic framework has stimulated debate about the definition of AD and related conditions. The potential for drugs to intercede in the pathogenic cascade of the disease adds some urgency to this debate. This paper by the International Working Group for New Research Criteria for the Diagnosis of AD aims to advance the scientific discussion by providing broader diagnostic coverage of the AD clinical spectrum and by proposing a common lexicon as a point of reference for the clinical and research communities. The cornerstone of this lexicon is to consider AD solely as a clinical and symptomatic entity that encompasses both predementia and dementia phases.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

has effects on multiple cerebral systems. In addition to cognitive and functional decline, diverse behavioral changes manifest with increasing severity over time, presenting significant management challenges for caregivers and health care professionals. Almost all patients with AD are affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms at some point during their illness; in some cases, symptoms occur prior to diagnosis of the dementia syndrome. Further, behavioral factors have been identified, which may have their origins in particular neurobiological processes, and respond to particular management strategies. Improved clarification of causes, triggers, and presentation of neuropsychiatric symptoms will guide both research and clinical decision-making. Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is most commonly by means of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; its utility and future development are discussed, as are the limitations and difficulties encountered when quantifying behavioral responses in clinical trials. Evidence from clinical trials of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and from neurobiological studies, provides a range of management options that can be tailored to individual needs. We suggest that non-pharmacological interventions (including psychosocial\/psychological counseling, interpersonal management and environmental management) should be attempted first, followed by the least harmful medication for the shortest time possible. Pharmacological treatment options, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, need careful consideration of the benefits and limitations of each drug class."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gauthier","ForeName":"Serge","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Unit, McGill Center for Studies in Aging, Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Montreal, Canada. serge.gauthier@mcgill.ca"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cummings","ForeName":"Jeffrey","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brodaty","ForeName":"Henry","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grossberg","ForeName":"George","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lyketsos","ForeName":"Constantine","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"01","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Anticonvulsants"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antidepressive Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Central Nervous System Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","drug therapy","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Anticonvulsants","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Antidepressive Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Central Nervous System Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Counseling"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Socioenvironmental Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"221"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20096151","S1041610209991505","10.1017\/S1041610209991505"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19751916","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"10","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1552-5279","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"5","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association","ISOAbbreviation":"Alzheimers Dement"},"ArticleTitle":"Severe Impairment Battery Language scale: a language-assessment tool for Alzheimer's disease patients.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"375-9"},"ELocationID":"10.1016\/j.jalz.2009.04.1236","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Communication problems are common in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but instruments to assess these symptoms are limited. Our objective was to create a new scale, based on the language subscale of the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), as a sensitive and reliable measurement of treatment effects on language performance.","All 24 items of the SIB language subscale were chosen for analysis. Baseline scores of 1320 moderate-to-severe patients (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, <15), from a combined AD database of four Memantine clinical trials (Study Codes: IE-2101, MEM-MD-01, MEM-MD-02, and MRZ-9605), were used for item reduction according to a standard principal components factor analysis. All items with loadings >0.5 on the identified factors were selected for inclusion in the new language scale. Correlations with existing AD scales were examined.","The analysis indicated six factors, with 21 of 24 items showing loadings >0.5. The resulting 21-item SIB Language (SIB-L) scale exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.809). The maximal SIB-L score was 41 points, with a measurement error of 3.7 points. The stratification of baseline SIB-L scores (mean, 31.7; SD, 8.4) by MMSE scores (mean, 9.7; SD, 3.3) showed a high variance in SIB-L scores. This confirms that patients with a low MMSE score can possess preserved language abilities.

The objective of this post hoc analysis was to assess the treatment effects of Memantine on language in patients with moderate to severe AD, using the recently developed Severe Impairment Battery-Language (SIB-L) scale.","From a combined database including four Memantine clinical trials in moderate-to-severe AD, we analyzed 801 patients with SIB-L scores of <38 and Mini-Mental State Examination scores of <15. Patients were treated with either 20 mg Memantine per day or placebo. Mean changes in SIB-L scores from baseline were calculated. For responder analyses, a change in SIB-L score greater than or equal to the SIB-L measurement error of 3.7 points was considered a clinically relevant response.","The mean change from baseline in SIB-L score at week 12 and weeks 24\/28 (study end) significantly favored Memantine over placebo treatment (P < .0001 and P = .0182, respectively). Overall, more Memantine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients benefited from treatment. The effect was especially pronounced in patients with substantial language impairment on the SIB-L (baseline score, <or=20). At weeks 24\/28, significantly more Memantine-treated patients experienced a clinically relevant improvement (25.4% vs. 10.8%, P = .0414), and significantly fewer patients experienced clinically relevant worsening (32.8% vs. 60.0%, P = .0029).","Memantine treatment of AD patients results in significant benefits for language function.

These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6-12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. In addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is encouraging."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive

public health priority. Due to the large numbers of affected patients, even interventions bringing about a relatively small delay in disease onset could have large public health effects. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of preventive interventions, but such trials raise specific methodological questions because they are new in the field of neurodegenerative diseases, and require large numbers of elderly subjects and lengthy follow-up periods. We performed a literature search to identify primary prevention RCTs for neurodegenerative dementia. The methodology of the trials was summarized and discussed during two expert meetings. Overall, 39 trials were identified that assessed dementia incidence or cognitive decline as a primary or secondary study outcome. Age was the most common selection criteria for target populations. Follow-up periods ranged from one month to nine years and were longest in studies measuring dementia incidence as an outcome. Results of RCTs have so far been generally negative and conflicting with those of observational studies, perhaps due to methodological issues. Future trials must therefore carefully consider the target population, outcomes and duration of follow-up to be used, and should assess the problem of attrition."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Andrieu","ForeName":"Sandrine","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Inserm U558, Toulouse, France. sandrieu@cict.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Coley","ForeName":"Nicola","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aisen","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carrillo","ForeName":"Maria C","Initials":"MC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"DeKosky","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Durga","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fillit","ForeName":"Howard","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Frisoni","ForeName":"Giovanni B","Initials":"GB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Froelich","ForeName":"Lutz","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gauthier","ForeName":"Serge","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jones","ForeName":"Roy","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"J\u00f6nsson","ForeName":"Linus","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Khachaturian","ForeName":"Zaven","Initials":"Z"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morris","ForeName":"John C","Initials":"JC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orgogozo","ForeName":"Jean-Marc","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ousset","ForeName":"Pierre-Jean","Initials":"PJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Salmon","ForeName":"Eric","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sampaio","ForeName":"Cristina","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Gordon","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vellas","ForeName":"Bruno","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Animals"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["complications","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"MEDLINE","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","QualifierName":["complications","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Prevention"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"166"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"2","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19221415","F3137183K48366G4","10.3233\/JAD-2009-0971"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18815451","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"02","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"21"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1423-0208","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"31","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2008"}},"Title":"Neuroepidemiology","ISOAbbreviation":"Neuroepidemiology"},"ArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the impact of memantine treatment initiation on psychotropics use: a study from the French national health care database.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"193-200"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000158226","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Clinical studies reported that treatments for Alzheimer's disease may have an impact on behavioral and psychiatric disorders.

Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid beta or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid beta as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau.

There is a growing interest in BPSD as they are responsible for a large share of the suffering of patients and caregivers, and they strongly determine the patient's lifestyle and management. Better detection and understanding of these symptoms is essential to provide appropriate management. This article is a consensus produced by the behavioral group of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC). The aim of this article is to present clinical description and biological correlates of the major behavioral and psychological symptomatology in AD. BPSD is not a unitary concept. Instead, it should be divided into several symptoms or more likely: groups of symptoms, each possibly reflecting a different prevalence, course over time, biological correlate and psychosocial determinants. There is some clinical evidence for clusters within groups of BPSD. Biological studies indicate that patients with AD and BPSD are associated with variations in the pathological features (atrophy, brain perfusion\/metabolism, histopathology) when compared to people with AD without BPSD. An individually tailored approach taking all these aspects into account is warranted as it may offer more, and better, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment opportunities."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources & de Recherche, CHU, Hopital Pasteur, Universit\u00e9 de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, 30, Avenue de la Voie Romaine, 06002 Nice cedex 1, France. philippe.robert15@wanadoo.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Byrne","ForeName":"E Jane","Initials":"EJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hurt","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"De Deyn","ForeName":"Peter Paul","Initials":"PP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nobili","ForeName":"Flavio","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Riello","ForeName":"Roberta","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rodriguez","ForeName":"Guido","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Frisoni","ForeName":"Giovanni B","Initials":"GB"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tsolaki","ForeName":"Magda","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kyriazopoulou","ForeName":"Nora","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bullock","ForeName":"Roger","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burns","ForeName":"Alistair","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vellas","ForeName":"Bruno","Initials":"B"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2005","Month":"01","Day":"27"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Eur Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"9111820","ISSNLinking":"0924-9338"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aggression","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["blood supply","pathology","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebrovascular Circulation","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Consensus"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Evoked Potentials","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Psychomotor Agitation","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotic Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Societies, Medical"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2004","Month":"04","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2004","Month":"09","Day":"11"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"3","Day":"16","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"11","Day":"29","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16310680","S0924-9338(04)00257-3","10.1016\/j.eurpsy.2004.09.031"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12947603","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0755-4982","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"32","Issue":"24 Suppl","PubDate":{"Year":"2003","Month":"Jul","Day":"12"}},"Title":"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)","ISOAbbreviation":"Presse Med"},"ArticleTitle":"[Depression and apathy in Alzheimer's disease].","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"S14-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"DEPRESSION IN THE ELDERLY SUBJECT: Depression is diagnosed to a varying extent in the elderly. In subjects with Alzheimer's disease, the most specific signs involve mood disorders, loss of energy, a feeling of hopelessness, and sometimes body discomfort or pain. DEFINITION OF APATHY: Apathy is defined as a loss of motivation, expressed by a loss of interest in activities, lack of productivity, loss of will and initiative, as well as limited affective response to positive or negative elements. TWO DIFFERENT SYNDROMES: The differential diagnosis is difficult, but studies have demonstrated that depression and apathy are two relatively different syndromes, which may be intertwined. Lack of volition and initiative are suggestive of apathy. Neuropsychology, particularly the capacity to divide attention, may be useful. FUNCTIONAL CONSEQUENCES: Apathy and depression both have functional effects which may accelerate institutionalization (altered capacity for initiative, adaptation to the environment). FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY AND NEUROCHEMICAL CONSEQUENCES: Apathy and to a lesser degree depression, involve prefrontal cortical areas. Involvement of the prefrontal pathways is a common feature of apathy and depression, but the other pathways are affected specifically. Cholinesterase inhibitors and selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors as well as serotoninergic antidepressants have been found to be effective for certain components of apathy."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Benoit","ForeName":"Michel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche CMRR-PACA, CHU Nice."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"}]},"Language":"fre","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["English Abstract","Journal Article"]},"VernacularTitle":"D\u00e9pression et apathie dans la maladie d'Alzheimer."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"France","MedlineTA":"Presse Med","NlmUniqueID":"8302490","ISSNLinking":"0755-4982"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Depressive Disorder, Major","QualifierName":["etiology","physiopathology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Gyrus Cinguli","QualifierName":["blood supply","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Hemodynamics"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Motivation"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, Emission-Computed"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"9","Day":"2","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"4","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"9","Day":"2","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12947603"}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12750851","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"12","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1619-7070","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"30","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2003","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging","ISOAbbreviation":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging"},"ArticleTitle":"99mTc-HMPAO and 99mTc-ECD perform differently in typically hypoperfused areas in Alzheimer's disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1009-13"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) and (99m)Tc- N, N\"-1,2-ethylene diylbis- l-cysteine diethyl ester dihydrochloride (ECD) yield significantly different images of cerebral perfusion owing to their particular pharmacokinetics. The aim of this study was to assess the topography, extension and statistical significance of these differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty-four patients with mild to moderate AD were retrospectively selected by two European centres. Two series of patients, including 32 studied with (99m)Tc-HMPAO single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and 32 studied with (99m)Tc-ECD SPET, were matched for sex, age (+\/-3 years) and severity of cognitive impairment as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (+\/-2 points), following a case-control procedure. SPET data were processed using SPM99 software (uncorrected height threshold: P=0.001). (99m)Tc-ECD SPET gave significantly higher uptake ratio values than (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPET in several symmetrical clusters, including the right and left occipital cuneus, the left occipital and parietal precuneus, and the left superior and middle temporal gyri. (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPET gave significantly higher uptake ratio values than ECD in two smaller clusters, including the hippocampus in both hemispheres. In AD, relative brain uptake of (99m)Tc-HMPAO and (99m)Tc-ECD is different in several brain regions, some of which are typically involved in AD, such as the precuneus and the hippocampus. These differences confirm the need for specific normal databases, but their impact on routine SPET reports in AD is not known and deserves an ad hoc

The aim of the present study was to validate, in French, a sensitive and specific screening battery designed to improve the discrimination between patients with AD, patients with depression and healthy elderly subjects. The Short Cognitive Evaluation Battery (SCEB) consists of 4 brief tests: temporal orientation, 5-word test, clock-drawing test and a semantic verbal fluency task. The SCEB was administered to 123 ambulatory subjects (mean age 76.4+\/-2.3 years): 49 patients with mild AD, 27 patients with depressive symptoms and 47 healthy elderly subjects. The mean time for administration of the test was 11.2 min in the AD group, 8.2 min in the depressive group and 7.2 min in the control group (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that, compared with controls, patients with mild AD were significantly impaired for all four tests. Response operating characteristics analysis of the SCEB showed: 93.8% sensitivity and 85% specificity for discriminating AD from control patients, and 63% sensitivity and 96% specificity for discriminating AD from depressive patients. In summary, the SCEB appears to be a highly sensitive and specific tool for discriminating between patients with mild AD and healthy elderly individuals. Furthermore, in combination with clinical evaluation, the SCEB could improve the specificity of the difficult discrimination between mild AD and depression.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2003 S.

This is usually assessed by means of clinical and neuropsychologic scales, whereas functional neuroimaging could allow objective evaluation of the topographic correlates of the effect of therapy on brain functioning. The aim of this study was to evaluate brain perfusion changes by SPECT in AD patients during chronic AChEI therapy in relation to their cognitive evolution.","Forty-seven consecutive outpatients with mild-to-moderate probable AD (as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [4th edition criteria] and a score of > or =15 on the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) were enrolled in 2 centers over a 1-y period and underwent SPECT with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime at the time of enrollment (t(0)). All of them started AChEI therapy. Nine patients were lost at follow-up, and drugs were withdrawn from 3 patients. Of the remaining 35 patients, who received regular AChEI therapy (donepezil, 5 or 10 mg\/d; rivastigmine, 6 or 9 mg\/d) throughout the observation period, only the 31 patients receiving donepezil were considered to avoid the possible confounding effect of different drugs. The 31 patients completed the study and a second SPECT examination was performed 15.0 +\/- 3.0 mo later (t(1)). They were divided into stabilized (17 patients) and nonstabilized (14 patients) subgroups on the basis of the minimum expected annual rate of decline of the MMSE score, derived from a meta-analysis of the literature. SPECT data were analyzed by means of statistical parametric mapping.","At baseline, the stabilized and nonstabilized patients were comparable for age, sex distribution, education, MMSE scores, memory impairment (selective reminding test [SRT]), apolipoprotein E genotype, AChEI dose regimen, and SPECT findings. The SRT scores decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the nonstabilized subgroup but not in the stabilized subgroup. No significant difference was found between the baseline and repeated SPECT data in the stabilized subgroup. In contrast, in the nonstabilized subgroup a significant perfusion reduction was found in the frontal, temporal, and parietal superficial cortex and in the occipital precuneus in the right hemisphere and in the frontal and mesial temporal cortex in the left hemisphere. On repeated SPECT, regional cerebral blood flow was significantly lower in a left frontal region in the nonstabilized group than in the stabilized group.","The regional cerebral blood flow decreases in several cortical regions in AD patients with cognitive deterioration despite long-term AChEI therapy, similar to that observed in untreated patients, whereas it remains stable in AD patients with stabilized cognitive performance during therapy."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nobili","ForeName":"Flavio","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinical Neurophysiology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy. fnobili@smartino.ge.it"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koulibaly","ForeName":"Malick","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vitali","ForeName":"Paolo","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Migneco","ForeName":"Octave","Initials":"O"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mariani","ForeName":"Giuliano","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ebmeier","ForeName":"Klaus","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pupi","ForeName":"Alberto","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rodriguez","ForeName":"Guido","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Darcourt","ForeName":"Jacques","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Nucl Med","NlmUniqueID":"0217410","ISSNLinking":"0161-5505"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Carbamates"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Indans"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Phenylcarbamates"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Piperidines"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Radiopharmaceuticals"},{"RegistryNumber":"3B744AG22N","NameOfSubstance":"Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime"},{"RegistryNumber":"8SSC91326P","NameOfSubstance":"Donepezil"},{"RegistryNumber":"PKI06M3IW0","NameOfSubstance":"Rivastigmine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","drug therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"diagnostic imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Carbamates","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Case-Control Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebrovascular Circulation","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Donepezil"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Indans","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Phenylcarbamates"},{"DescriptorName":"Piperidines","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Radiopharmaceuticals"},{"DescriptorName":"Rivastigmine"},{"DescriptorName":"Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime"},{"DescriptorName":"Time Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"8","Day":"7","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"8","Day":"24","Hour":"10","Minute":"1"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"8","Day":"7","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12163621"}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12094826","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"01","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0300-7995","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2002"}},"Title":"Current medical research and opinion","ISOAbbreviation":"Curr Med Res Opin"},"ArticleTitle":"Understanding and managing behavioural symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: focus on rivastigmine.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"156-71"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are among the most distressing manifestations of dementia and result in considerable social and economic costs. Practical, non-pharmacological approaches such as environmental and behavioural changes may provide some benefit for patients in managing mild BPSD. In addition, various pharmacological approaches to treatment have been employed, such as neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics, which differ in neurochemical target and clinical effectiveness. Growing evidence suggests that the neurobiological basis of BPSD in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias is a loss of cholinergic neurones and a resultant decline in acetylcholine (ACh) in brain regions which regulate behavioural and emotional responses, such as the limbic system. This cholinergic deficit can be partly corrected by inhibiting cholinesterase enzymes (ChEs). Studies of ChE inhibitors have shown positive effects to improve or stabilise existing BPSD and delay the emergence of new behavioural symptoms. In placebo-controlled studies, donepezil has reported efficacy in non-institutionalised moderate to moderately severe patients over a period of 24 weeks, but has failed to demonstrate efficacy in mild to moderate AD and in institutionalised patients with severe disease. Galantamine has been shown to delay the onset of BPSD in mild to moderate AD patients in one placebo-controlled study, and improve BPSD in a similar study of patients with cerebrovascular disease or probable vascular dementia. Studies with rivastigmine have shown efficacy in placebo-controlled studies of mild to moderately severe AD and in patients with Lewy body variant AD. Institutionalised patients with severe disease also show symptomatic benefits in BPSD with rivastigmine, resulting in a reduction in concomitant psychoactive medication use. Symptom complexes responding to ChE inhibitors appear to differ - all agents improve apathy, depression and anxiety, while rivastigmine additionally improves hallucinations and delusions, possibility as a result of dual inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The presence of hallucinations has been shown to predict response to rivastigmine. Accumulating data from studies of ChE inhibitors suggest that early intervention and long-term treatment, in addition to providing cognitive benefits, improves BPSD and offers potential to enhance quality of life. Differences seen between the agents in terms of efficacy in BPSD, tolerability and safety profiles may be the result of differences in neuropharmacological profiles."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Memory Centre UEC, Centre Hospitalier universitaire de Nice, France."}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Curr Med Res Opin","NlmUniqueID":"0351014","ISSNLinking":"0300-7995"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Carbamates"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Indans"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Neuroprotective Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Phenylcarbamates"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Piperidines"},{"RegistryNumber":"0D3Q044KCA","NameOfSubstance":"Galantamine"},{"RegistryNumber":"4VX7YNB537","NameOfSubstance":"Tacrine"},{"RegistryNumber":"8SSC91326P","NameOfSubstance":"Donepezil"},{"RegistryNumber":"9U1VM840SP","NameOfSubstance":"Physostigmine"},{"RegistryNumber":"N9YNS0M02X","NameOfSubstance":"Acetylcholine"},{"RegistryNumber":"PKI06M3IW0","NameOfSubstance":"Rivastigmine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Acetylcholine","QualifierName":["antagonists & inhibitors","metabolism"]},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["drug therapy","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Carbamates","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Donepezil"},{"DescriptorName":"Galantamine","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Indans","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuroprotective Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Phenylcarbamates"},{"DescriptorName":"Physostigmine","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Piperidines","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Rivastigmine"},{"DescriptorName":"Tacrine","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Time Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"152"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"7","Day":"4","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"1","Day":"23","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"7","Day":"4","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12094826","10.1185\/030079902125000561"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12036510","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2002","Month":"07","Day":"31"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"08","Day":"26"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0165-1781","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"114","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Jun","Day":"15"}},"Title":"Psychiatry research","ISOAbbreviation":"Psychiatry Res"},"ArticleTitle":"Brain perfusion in Alzheimer's disease with and without apathy: a SPECT study with statistical parametric mapping analysis.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"103-11"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically characterized by cognitive symptoms that, in combination with behavioral disturbances, significantly interfere with activities of daily living. These behavioral disorders contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of the disease and probably express different pathophysiological processes. Apathy is one of the most frequent behavioral disorders in AD. The aim of this study was to evaluate brain perfusion of AD patients with and without apathy (as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory) compared with that in healthy elderly subjects. A total of 15 AD patients without apathy (AD\/NA; mean age 76.6) and 15 AD patients with apathy (AD\/A; mean age 77.6) were studied. Brain perfusion was measured by 99mTc-labeled bicisate (ECD) single-photon emission tomography (ECD SPECT). The images of the two AD subgroups were compared by means of statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99) to corresponding images of 11 healthy elderly control subjects (obtained from the Society of Nuclear Medicine database). Compared with the healthy elderly subjects, the apathy-free AD subgroup had significantly lower perfusion of inferior temporal regions (left fusiform gyrus, left parahippocampal area) and occipital regions (left gyrus lingualis). The apathy subgroup had significantly decreased perfusion of the left anterior cingulate, the right inferior and medial gyrus frontalis, the left orbitofrontal gyrus and the right gyrus lingualis. The differences in the brain areas with reduced perfusion between the apathy-free subjects (mainly the posterior regions) and the apathetic subjects (mainly the anterior regions) indicate that behavioral disorders such as apathy participate in the heterogeneity of brain perfusion in AD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Benoit","ForeName":"Michel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinique de Psychiatrie et de Psychologie Medicale, H\u00f4pital Pasteur, Universit\u00e9 de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, 30 avenue de la Voie Romaine, F-06002 Nice Cedex 1, France. michel.beniot@unice.fr"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koulibaly","ForeName":"Pierre Malick","Initials":"PM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Migneco","ForeName":"Octave","Initials":"O"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Darcourt","ForeName":"Jacques","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pringuey","ForeName":"Dominique J","Initials":"DJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe H","Initials":"PH"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Ireland","MedlineTA":"Psychiatry Res","NlmUniqueID":"7911385","ISSNLinking":"0165-1781"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["blood supply","diagnostic imaging"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dominance, Cerebral","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Status Schedule"},{"DescriptorName":"Motivation"},{"DescriptorName":"Personality Assessment"},{"DescriptorName":"Regional Blood Flow","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"5","Day":"31","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"8","Day":"1","Hour":"10","Minute":"1"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"5","Day":"31","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12036510","S0925492702000033","10.1016\/s0925-4927(02)00003-3"]}}}]}
