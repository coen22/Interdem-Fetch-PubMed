long-term social care with 10 people with Alzheimer-type dementia found that places the participants had known early in life were spontaneously foregrounded. Participants' memories of such places were well-preserved, particularly when photo-elicitation techniques, using visual images as prompts, were employed. Consistent with previous work on the 'reminiscence bump' in dementia, the foregrounded memories belonged in all cases to the period of life between approximately 5 and 30 years. Frequently the remembered places were connected with major life events which continued to have a strong emotional component. The continuing significance of place in the context of long-term dementia care is considered from a psychogeographical perspective. ","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is acknowledged that while there is a range of effective ways to care for and support people with dementia and their families from diagnosis to death, these have yet to become integral to practice. In England, for example, the National Dementia Strategy seeks to transform the quality of dementia care. One of the key components to transforming the quality of care is to ensure we have an informed and effective workforce. We argue here that in order to transform the quality of care we need to distinguish between the aims of training and education. Whilst there is a place for skills-based workplace training, Higher Education in dementia studies has a key role to play in the provision of specialist knowledge and skills in dementia care emphasizing as it does the development of critical thinking, reflection and action. In this paper we describe dementia studies at Bradford University available at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. We outline their aims and learning outcomes, curricula, approach to teaching, learning and assessment. We describe the nature of students who study with us, noting their fit with the Higher Education Funding Council in England's agenda for widening participation in higher education. Higher Education in dementia studies has a unique role to play in equipping practitioners and professionals with the information, skills and attitudes to realize the potential for quality of life for people with dementia and their families."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"M","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bradford Dementia Group, Division of Dementia Studies, School of Health Studies, Bradford University, Bradford, West Yorkshire, U.K. m.downs@bradford.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Capstick","ForeName":"A","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baldwin","ForeName":"P C","Initials":"PC"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Surr","ForeName":"C","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bruce","ForeName":"E","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2009","Month":"03","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Medical"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Teaching"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"},{"DescriptorName":"Universities"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"3","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"3","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"4","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19317922","S1041610209008837","10.1017\/S1041610209008837"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17698260","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"01","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0260-6917","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Nurse education today","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurse Educ Today"},"ArticleTitle":"Hearing the voice of people with dementia in professional education.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"821-4"},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hope","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pulsford","ForeName":"Dave","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thompson","ForeName":"Rachel","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Capstick","ForeName":"Andrea","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Heyward","ForeName":"Tony","Initials":"T"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Editorial","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Scotland","MedlineTA":"Nurse Educ Today","NlmUniqueID":"8511379","ISSNLinking":"0260-6917"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["epidemiology","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Professional","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Needs Assessment","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Participation","QualifierName":["methods","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Teaching Materials"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"24"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2008","Month":"1","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17698260","S0260-6917(07)00088-3","10.1016\/j.nedt.2007.06.005"]}}}]}
