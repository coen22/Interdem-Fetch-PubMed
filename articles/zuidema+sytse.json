The intervention consisted of an educational program and a multidisciplinary care program and was implemented in 13 nursing homes from September 2015 to March 2017. Costs' outcomes included the time investment of the elderly care physician and health care psychologists regarding the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms, residents' psychotropic drug use, nursing staff absenteeism, and costs of the educational program. Composite cost measure contained the sum of costs of staff absenteeism, costs on psychotropic drugs, and costs of the educational program. Costs of time investment were investigated by comparing means. Costs of psychotropic drug use were analyzed with mixed models at resident level and as part of the composite cost measure on unit level. Staff absenteeism was also analyzed at unit level.","Compared with care as usual, the mean costs of time invested decreased with \u20ac36.79 for the elderly care physician but increased with \u20ac46.05 for the health care psychologist in the intervention condition. Mixed model analysis showed no effect of the intervention compared with care as usual on the costs of psychotropic drug use, staff absenteeism, and the composite cost measure. The costs of the educational program were on average \u20ac174.13 per resident.","The intervention did not result in increased costs compared with care as usual. Other aspects, such as the lack of a structured working method, should be taken into account when considering implementation of the intervention."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"298"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12888-019-2291-4","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Psychotropic drugs are often prescribed to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home residents with dementia, despite having limited efficacy and considerable side effects. To reduce the inappropriate prescribing of these psychotropic drugs, various non-pharmacological, psychosocial, person-centered, or multidisciplinary interventions are advocated. However, existing multidisciplinary interventions have shown variable effects, with limited effectiveness often resulting from suboptimal implementation. We hypothesize that an effective intervention needs to fit the local situation of a nursing home and that support should be offered during implementation.","We will embed participatory action research within a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to study the effects of a tailored intervention and implementation plan to reduce inappropriate psychotropic drug prescribing. Nursing homes will be provided with tailored information about the perceived problems of managing neuropsychiatric symptoms and we will offer coaching support throughout. Alongside the participatory action research, we will perform a process evaluation to examine the quality of the study, the intervention, and the implementation. Our aim is to recruit 600 residents from 16 nursing homes throughout the Netherlands, with measurements taken at baseline, 8\u2009months, and 16\u2009months. Nursing homes will be randomly allocated to an intervention or a deferred intervention group. During each intervention stage, we will provide information about inappropriate psychotropic drug prescribing, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and difficulties in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms through collaboration with each nursing home. After this, a tailored intervention and implementation plan will be written and implemented, guided by a coach. The primary outcome will be the reduction of inappropriate prescribing, as measured by the Appropriate Psychotropic drug use In Dementia index. Secondary outcomes will be the frequency of psychotropic drug use and neuropsychiatric symptoms, plus quality of life. A mixed methods design will be used for the process evaluation. Effects will be assessed using multilevel analyses. The project leader of the nursing home and the coach will complete questionnaires and in-depth interviews.","We anticipate that the proposed tailored intervention with coaching will reduce inappropriate psychotropic drug prescribing for nursing home residents with neuropsychiatric symptoms. This study should also provide insights into the barriers to, and facilitators of, implementation.","NTR5872 , registered on July 2,

subjective scales are used.","The aim of this study was to compare subjective outcomes with objective outcomes of conventional and atypical antipsychotics for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia.","We performed a meta-epidemiological study of 38 randomized, placebo-controlled trials. For effectiveness, we used change in NPS and response rate as subjective outcomes, while overall dropout and additional psychotropic use were used as objective outcomes. For side effects, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and somnolence were used as subjective outcomes, while dropout due to adverse events, medication use for EPS, and participants falling were used as objective outcomes.","Conventional antipsychotics reduced NPS more than placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] -\u20090.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] -\u20090.49 to -\u20090.23), as did atypical antipsychotics (SMD -\u20090.14, 95% CI -\u20090.19 to -\u20090.08). Response rates in the drug groups were also higher. Overall dropout did not differ between conventional antipsychotics and placebo (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% CI 0.77-1.37) or atypical antipsychotics and placebo (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.89-1.14). Furthermore, additional psychotropic use did not differ. The risk of EPS was higher for conventional (OR 2.93, 95% CI 2.04-4.22) and atypical antipsychotics (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.23-1.88) versus placebo, as was the risk of somnolence and dropout due to adverse events, but medication use for EPS, as well as risk of falls, was not.","The effectiveness of antipsychotics for NPS in dementia based on subjective scales was not confirmed using objective outcomes,

with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia and are associated with various disadvantageous clinical outcomes including a negative impact on quality of life, caregiver burden, and accelerated disease progression. Despite growing evidence of the efficacy of (non)pharmacological interventions to reduce these symptoms, NPS remain underrecognized and undertreated in memory clinics. The BEhavioural symptoms in Alzheimer's disease Towards early Identification and Treatment (BEAT-IT) study is developed to (1) investigate the neurobiological etiology of NPS in AD and (2) study the effectiveness of the Describe, Investigate, Create, Evaluate (DICE) approach to structure and standardize the current care of NPS in AD. By means of the DICE method, we aim to improve the quality of life of AD patients with NPS and their caregivers who visit the memory clinic. This paper describes the protocol for the intervention study that incorporates the latter aim.","We aim to enroll a total of 150 community-dwelling patients with MCI or AD and their caregivers in two waves. First, we will recruit a control group who will receive care as usual. Next, the second wave of participants will undergo the DICE method. This approach consists of the following steps: (1) describe the context in which NPS occur, (2) investigate the possible causes, (3) create and implement a treatment plan, and (4) evaluate whether these interventions are effective. Primary outcomes are the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Secondary outcomes include NPS change, caregiver burden, caregivers' confidence managing NPS, psychotropic medication use, the experiences of patients and caregivers who underwent the DICE method, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.","This paper describes the protocol of an intervention study that is part of the BEAT-IT study and aims to improve current recognition and treatment of NPS in AD by structuring and standardizing the detection and treatment of NPS in AD using the DICE approach.","The trial was registered on the Netherlands Trial Registry ( NTR7459 ); registered 6

residents with young-onset dementia and burdensome for nursing staff. It is known that neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with burn-out complaints and low job satisfaction. An intervention aimed at decreasing neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home residents with young-onset dementia might also result in less burnout complaints and job demands and improve job satisfaction in nursing staff.","The aim was to evaluate the effect of the intervention on nursing staff burnout, job satisfaction and job demands.","Cluster randomised controlled trial using a stepped wedge design with a total duration of 18 months, with four assessments.","Thirteen young-onset dementia special care units across the Netherlands were, by means of random allocation software, assigned to three groups crossing over at different time points.","All nursing staff, in total 391, were invited to participate. 305 nursing staff participated during the course of the study of whom 71 participated in all assessments.","An educational program followed by a structured multidisciplinary care program aimed at the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms. The care program consists of evaluation of psychotropic drug prescription followed by detection, analysis, treatment and evaluation of treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms.","Emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment were assessed with the Utrecht Burnout Scale. Job satisfaction and job demands were assessed with subscales of the Leiden Quality of Work Questionnaire.","The baseline burnout risk on emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment was average, and low on depersonalisation. The mean scores for job satisfaction were above average and for job demands average. Linear mixed models showed that the intervention had no effect on emotional exhaustion (estimated effect -0.04, 95% confidence interval -1.25 to 1.16), depersonalisation (estimated effect 0.24, 95% confidence interval -0.26 to 0.74), personal accomplishment (estimated effect -0.82, 95% confidence interval -1.86 to 0.22) job satisfaction (estimated effect -0.40, 95% confidence interval -0.98 to 0.17) and job demands (estimated effect -0.04, 95% confidence interval -0.57 to 0.49). A significant difference was found between registered nurses and other nursing staff on emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction. Compared to other staff members, registered nurses' emotional exhaustion scores slightly increased while job satisfaction slightly decreased when using the intervention.","The intervention was not effective on three dimensions of burnout, job satisfaction and job demands. Staff scored positive on the outcomes of interest before implementation of the intervention, leaving little opportunity for improvement."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

psychotropic drugs. Thus far, studies on psychotropic drug use (PDU) mainly focused on elderly patients with dementia. It is important to know the prevalence and correlates of PDU in patients with young-onset dementia (YOD) to optimize NPS treatment and reduce excess PDU in this group.","The Behavior and Evolution in Young-Onset Dementia (BEYOnD) study is a cross-sectional study in 230 residents with YOD in eight nursing homes providing specialized YOD care. PDU was registered from medical charts. The influence of age, gender, severity, and type of dementia, NPS, and agitation on PDU was analyzed.","Eighty-seven percent of the residents used psychotropic drugs, and 47% used two or more psychotropic drugs. No significant associations with age, gender, dementia subtype, and dementia severity were found. Depressive symptoms showed an association with the use of antidepressants, nighttime behavior with use of hypnotics, and verbal agitation with antipsychotics. Apathy was strongly associated with lower PDU.","Nursing home patients with YOD have a high prevalence of PDU. The association with NPS raises questions of efficacy of these drugs in managing NPS. Patients with apathy had a lower chance of using psychotropics. More research on indications and effects of psychotropic drugs is needed, as well as on (nonpharmacological) alternatives for managing challenging behavior in

individual distress and high societal costs. Music interventions such as group music therapy (GMT) and recreational choir singing (RCS) have shown promising effects, but their comparative effectiveness across clinical subgroups is unknown. This trial aims to determine effectiveness of GMT, RCS and their combination for care home residents and to examine heterogeneity of treatment effects across subgroups.","This large, pragmatic, multinational cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 2\u00d72\u2009factorial design will compare the effects of GMT, RCS, both or neither, for care home residents aged 65 years or older with dementia and depressive symptoms. We will randomise 100 care home units with \u22651000 residents in total across eight countries. Each intervention will be offered for 6 months (3 months 2 times\/week followed by 3 months 1 time\/week), with extension allowed if locally available. The primary outcome will be the change in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning, neuropsychiatric symptoms, psychotropic drug use, caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality and costs over at least 12 months. The study has 90% power to detect main effects and is also powered to determine interaction effects with gender, severity and socioeconomic status.","Ethical approval has been obtained for one country and will be obtained for all countries. Results will be presented at national and international conferences and published in scientific journals.","NCT03496675; Pre-results, ACTRN12618000156280."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

on caregivers, especially spouses. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and physical symptoms in the caregiver, with early institutionalization for the patient. An Australian study reported that a residential caregiver training program delivered in medical settings could delay nursing home admission, lower mortality, reduce psychological morbidity in caregivers, and lower healthcare costs. In this replication study, we aim to determine the effectiveness of an adaptation of this program to non-medical settings in the Dutch health care system.","A randomized controlled study design will be used, comparing an intervention group with a control group. The intervention will last for five days and will be delivered in either a holiday park or a bed and breakfast setting. The control group will receive care as usual. Data will be collected at baseline and after 3 and 6\u00a0months, and outcomes will be assessed in the caregiver group and in the dementia group. The primary outcome will be caregiver-related quality of life after 3\u00a0months. The main secondary outcome will be the neuropsychiatric symptoms in the dementia group. Secondary outcomes in the dementia group will be activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, use of health facilities, quality of life, agitation, dementia severity, and use of psychotropic medication. Secondary outcomes in the caregiver group will be the subjective and objective burdens, health and health care facility use, psychotropic medication use, depression, anxiety, and perseverance time.","We anticipate that the outcomes will allow us to confirm the effectiveness of the intervention, and in turn, potentially inform the introduction of this program into care plans. It is also expected that the experiences and recommendations of participants will help us to develop the training program further.","Registered in the Netherlands Trial Register on March 9, 2016,

effective in improving cognitive functions and reducing depressive symptoms in people with dementia. Life story books (LSBs) are frequently used as a reminiscence tool to support recollecting autobiographical memories. As little is known about how LSBs are used and what type of studies have been employed to evaluate LSB interventions, we conducted a systematic review.","The electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, and PsychINFO as well as reference lists of existing studies were searched to select eligible articles. Out of the 55 studies found, 14 met the inclusion criterion of an original empirical study on LSBs in people with dementia.","The majority of the LSBs were tangible books, although some digital applications were also found. The LSBs were created mostly in individual sessions in nursing homes with a median of six sessions. Some studies only focused on the person with dementia, while others also examined (in)formal caregivers. Most studies used qualitative interviews, case studies, and\/or (pilot) randomized controlled trial (RCTs) with small sample sizes. Qualitative findings showed the value of LSBs in triggering memories and in improving the relation with the person with dementia. Quantitative effects were found on, e.g. autobiographical memory and depression of persons with dementia, quality of relationship with informal caregivers, burden of informal caregivers, and on attitudes and knowledge of formal caregivers.","This systematic review confirms that the use of LSBs to support reminiscence and person-centered care is promising, but larger RCTs or implementation studies are needed to establish the effects of LSBs on people with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elfrink","ForeName":"Teuntje R","Initials":"TR","Identifier":"0000-0002-5428-0699","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology,Health and Technology,University of Twente,Enschede,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zuidema","ForeName":"Sytse U","Initials":"SU","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine,University of Groningen,University Medical Center Groningen,Groningen,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kunz","ForeName":"Miriam","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice and Elderly Care Medicine,University of Groningen,University Medical Center Groningen,Groningen,the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Westerhof","ForeName":"Gerben J","Initials":"GJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology,Health and Technology,University of Twente,Enschede,the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"07","Day":"18"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Autobiographies as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Recall"},{"DescriptorName":"Person-Centered Psychotherapy"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["caregivers","dementia","life story book","person-centered care","reminiscence","systematic review"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30017005","S1041610218000376","10.1017\/S1041610218000376"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29653809","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1538-9375","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"19","Issue":"8","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"08"}},"Title":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","ISOAbbreviation":"J Am Med Dir Assoc"},"ArticleTitle":"Process Evaluation of an Intervention for the Management of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Young-Onset Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"663-671"},"ELocationID":["S1525-8610(18)30101-4","10.1016\/j.jamda.2018.02.013"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["A process evaluation was performed for an intervention aimed at improvement of the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in young-onset dementia.

Psychotropic drugs for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequently used to manage these problems, but they are of limited effectiveness and can have serious side effects.

In addition, the pooled effects of specific psychosocial interventions in homogenous subgroups were analyzed (meta-analysis).","Eleven randomized controlled studies that investigated multiple psychotropic drugs interventions (psychotropic drugs in 3, antipsychotics in 9, and antidepressants in 5 studies) as well as different types of psychosocial interventions were included.

In 7 out of 9 studies reporting on antipsychotic drug use, the physician was actively involved. Nine studies in which antipsychotic drug use was specified reported a significant decrease in prescription rate as a result of psychosocial interventions [relative risk (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.88], whereas meta-analysis of 5 studies investigating antidepressant drug use failed to show a significant effect (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.02).

of hypertonia, causing loss of functional mobility in early stages of dementia to severe high muscle tone and pain in the late stages. For assessing and evaluating therapeutic interventions, objective instruments are required.","Determine the psychometric properties of the MyotonPRO, a portable device that objectively measures muscle properties, in dementia patients with paratonia.","Muscle properties were assessed with the MyotonPRO by 2 assessors within one session and repeated by the main researcher after 30 min and again after 6 months. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for all MyotonPRO outcomes to discriminate between participants with (n = 70) and without paratonia (n = 82). In the participants with paratonia, correlation coefficients were established between the MyotonPRO outcomes and the Modified Ashworth Scale for paratonia (MAS-P) and muscle palpation. In participants with paratonia, reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient) and agreement values (standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change) were established. Longitudinal outcome from participants with paratonia throughout the study (n = 48) was used to establish the sensitivity for change (correlation coefficient) and responsiveness (minimal clinical important difference).","Included were 152 participants with dementia (mean [standard deviation] age of 83.5 [98.2]). The area under the curve ranged from 0.60 to 0.67 indicating the MyotonPRO is able to differentiate between participants with and without paratonia. The MyotonPRO explained 10-18% of the MAS-P score and 8-14% of the palpation score. Interclass correlation coefficients for interrater reliability ranged from 0.57 to 0.75 and from 0.54 to 0.71 for intrarater. The best agreement values were found for tone, elasticity, and stiffness. The change between baseline and 6 months in the MyotonPRO outcomes explained 8-13% of the change in the MAS-P scores. The minimal clinically important difference values were all smaller than the measurement error.","The MyotonPRO is potentially applicable for cross-sectional studies between groups of paratonia patients and appears less suitable to measure intraindividual changes in paratonia. Because of the inherent variability in movement resistance in paratonia, the outcomes from the MyotonPRO should be interpreted with care; therefore, future research should focus on additional guidelines to increase the clinical interpretation and improving reproducibility."],"CopyrightInformation":"The Author(s).

This index assesses information from medical records on indication, evaluation, dosage, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, duplications, and therapy duration. Various measurements were carried out to identify the possible patient and non-patient factors.

Analyses were performed for groups of PDs separately, i.e. antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.","The sample consisted of 338 patients with a PD prescription that used 147 antipsychotics, 167 antidepressants, 85 anxiolytics, and 76 hypnotics. It was found that older patients and more severe aggression, agitation, apathy, and depression were associated with more appropriate prescriptions. Additionally, less appropriate prescriptions were found to be associated with more severe anxiety, dementia diagnoses other than Alzheimer dementia, more physician time available per patient, more patients per physician, more years of experience of the physician, and higher nurse's workload.","The association of more pronounced NPS with more appropriate PD prescriptions implies that physicians should pay more attention to the appropriateness of PD prescriptions when NPS are less manifest.

distinctive form of hypertonia in patients with dementia, causes loss of functional mobility in early stage dementia to severe contractures and pain in the late stages. The pathogenesis of paratonia is not well understood. Patients in early stage dementia with diabetes mellitus showed a significantly higher risk for the development of paratonia. Both Alzheimer disease and diabetes mellitus are related to higher concentrations of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).

A significant association between AGE levels and the presence of paratonia (odds ratio 3.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87-6.44, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and paratonia severity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.17, 95% CI 0.11-0.23, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) was determined.

Notwithstanding, change in AGE levels was not significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a0.062) related to change in paratonia severity, mixed model analyses provided evidence for both a significant time and between participant effect of AGEs on paratonia severity.","This study suggests that elevated AGE levels are a contributing factor to paratonia and its severity and could be the result of peripheral biomechanical changes reducing elasticity and increasing stiffness. These results provide a new perspective on paratonia and gives rise to further research whether paratonia could be postponed or movement stiffness can be improved by reducing AGE levels."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Given changes in care systems, more persons with dementia will live longer at home. However, living at home (with dementia) with a good quality of life is not easy to achieve. Dementia is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms like apathy, agitation, depression, and anxiety, which have a negative impact on quality of life. Whereas cognitive deterioration can hardly be influenced, it is possible to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms. As autobiographical memories remain intact for a relatively long time in dementia, reminiscence interventions can promote feelings of pleasure and trust. The Online Life Story Book (OLSB) allows to digitally share memories (stories, pictures, video or audio fragments). The main objective is to study the effects of the OLSB on neuropsychiatric symptoms. The study has four secondary objectives: 1) to study the effectiveness of the intervention on the burden and quality of life of the primary informal caregiver; 2) to provide a preliminary health-economic evaluation; 3) to study the (time to) nursing home admittance as a longer term effect; 4) to provide a process evaluation.","A randomized controlled trial with individual randomization to one of two conditions is conducted: 1) intervention \"Online Life Story Book\"; 2) control condition (care as usual). Participants are persons with early dementia and their primary caregivers. In the intervention OLSB, a trained volunteer guides the participants through the process of putting together a timeline of their lives during 5 meetings within a period of 8-10\u00a0weeks. To assess the effects of the intervention on the primary outcome, neuropsychiatric symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) will be assessed at three time points: before the intervention (baseline, T0), 3 months (T1) and 6 months (T2) post baseline.","When proven effective, the Online Life Story Book can be a valuable addition to the existing provision of care for persons with dementia and their informal caregivers.","This study has been approved by the Twente Medical Ethics Committee under the file number p16-04 (Dutch Trial Register: NTR5939 , date of registration: 14 March 2016)."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elfrink","ForeName":"Teuntje R","Initials":"TR","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Health and Technology, University of Twente, P.O.

A comprehensive systematic literature search identified 19 longitudinal cohort studies investigating the association between various social relationship factors and incident dementia in the general population. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Low social participation (RR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.13-1.75)), less frequent social contact (RR: 1.57 (95% CI: 1.32-1.85)), and more loneliness (RR: 1.58 (95% CI: 1.19-2.09)) were statistically significant associated with incident dementia. The results of the association between social network size and dementia were inconsistent. No statistically significant association was found for low satisfaction with social network and the onset of dementia (RR: 1.25 (95% CI: 0.96-1.62). We conclude that social relationship factors that represent a lack of social interaction are associated with incident dementia. The strength of the associations between poor social interaction and incident dementia is comparable with other well-established risk factors for dementia, including low education attainment, physical inactivity, and late-life depression.

Fourth, external factors including staffing issues, nursing home setting, access to consultants, national and local policies, and zeitgeist were considered to affect PD prescription.","We have developed a conceptual framework explaining how different factors influence PD prescription. This provides opportunities for improving PD prescription in NH residents with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smeets","ForeName":"Claudia H W","Initials":"CH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Center for Family Medicine, Geriatric Care and Public Health, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Inappropriate prescribing is therefore likely to occur, which in turn is expected to worsen cognitive impairment, to increase the fall risk and to decrease residents' quality of life. The objective of the 'Discontinuing Inappropriate Medication in Nursing Home Residents' (DIM-NHR) study is to examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Multidisciplinary Multistep Medication Review (3MR) that is aimed at optimising prescribing and discontinuing inappropriate medication.","A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Elderly care physicians and their wards (clusters) will be randomised. Data will be collected at baseline and 4\u2005months after the 3MR has taken place. Six hundred nursing home residents will be recruited of whom more than half are expected to suffer from dementia. The 3MR will be based on consensus criteria and the relevant literature and will be performed by the patient's elderly care physician in collaboration with a pharmacist.","Primary outcomes-the difference in proportion of residents who successfully discontinued inappropriate medication between the intervention and control group at follow-up. Secondary outcomes-undertreatment, exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medicines, neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, falls, hospital admission, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.","Participant burden will be kept at a minimum. The elderly care physician will remain free to adjust medication when symptoms relapse or adverse events occur, rendering serious adverse events highly unlikely. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and a 3MR toolkit will be developed.","This study has been registered at http:\/\/www.ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT01876095)."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia in nursing homes. Alongside an 18-month cluster-randomized controlled trial in which we studied the effectiveness of DCM on residents and staff outcomes, we investigated differences in costs of care between DCM and usual care in nursing homes.","Dementia special care units were randomly assigned to DCM or usual care. Nurses from the intervention care homes received DCM training, a DCM organizational briefing day and conducted the 4-months DCM-intervention twice during the study. A single DCM cycle consists of observation, feedback to the staff, and action plans for the residents. We measured costs related to health care consumption, falls and psychotropic drug use at the resident level and absenteeism at the staff level. Data were extracted from resident files and the nursing home records. Prizes were determined using the Dutch manual of health care cost and the cost prices delivered by a pharmacy and a nursing home. Total costs were evaluated by means of linear mixed-effect models for longitudinal data, with the unit as a random effect to correct for dependencies within units.","34 units from 11 nursing homes, including 318 residents and 376 nursing staff members participated in the cost analyses. Analyses showed no difference in total costs. However certain changes within costs could be noticed. The intervention group showed lower costs associated with outpatient hospital appointments over time (p = 0.05) than the control group. In both groups, the number of falls, costs associated with the elderly-care physician and nurse practitioner increased equally during the study (p<0.02).","DCM is a cost-neutral intervention. It effectively reduces outpatient hospital appointments compared to usual care. Other considerations than costs, such as nursing homes' preferences, may determine whether they adopt the DCM method.","Dutch Trials Registry NTR2314."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Gelderland, The Netherlands ;

These drugs can have many side effects and effectiveness is limited. Psychotropic drug use between nursing home units varies and is not solely related to the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is growing evidence indicating that psychotropic drug use is associated with environmental factors, suggesting that the prescription of psychotropic drugs is not only related to (objective) patient factors. However, other factors related to the patient, elderly care physician, nurse and the physical environment are only partially identified. Using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative research, this study aims to understand the nature of psychotropic drug use and its underlying factors by identifying: 1) frequency and appropriateness of psychotropic drug use for neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia, 2) factors associated with (appropriateness of) psychotropic drug use.","A cross-sectional mixed methods study. For the quantitative study, patients with dementia (n = 540), nursing staff and elderly care physicians of 36 Dementia Special Care Units of 12 nursing homes throughout the Netherlands will be recruited. Six nursing homes with high average rates and six with low average rates of psychotropic drug use, based on a national survey about frequency of psychotropic drug use on units, will be included. Psychotropic drugs include antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and anti-dementia drugs. Appropriateness will be measured by an instrument based on the Medication Appropriateness Index and current guidelines for treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Factors associated to psychotropic drug use, related to the patient, elderly care physician, nurse and physical environment, will be explored using multilevel regression analyses. For the qualitative study, in depth interviews with staff will be held and analyzed to identify and explore other unknown factors.","This study will provide insight into factors that are associated with the frequency and appropriateness of psychotropic drug use for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Understanding psychotropic drug use and its associations may contribute to better dementia

Despite modest effectiveness and considerable side effects, psychotropic drugs are frequently prescribed for these neuropsychiatric symptoms. This raises questions whether psychotropic drugs are appropriately prescribed. The aim of the PROPER (PRescription Optimization of Psychotropic drugs in Elderly nuRsing home patients with dementia) II study is to investigate the efficacy of an intervention for improving the appropriateness of psychotropic drug prescription in nursing home patients with dementia.","The PROPER II study is a multi-center cluster randomized controlled, pragmatic trial using parallel groups. It has a duration of eighteen months and four six-monthly assessments. Six nursing homes will participate in the intervention and six will continue care as usual. The nursing homes will be located throughout the Netherlands, each participating with two dementia special care units with an average of fifteen patients per unit, resulting in 360 patients. The intervention consists of a structured and repeated multidisciplinary medication review supported by education and continuous evaluation. It is conducted by pharmacists, physicians, and nurses and consists of three components: 1) preparation and education, 2) conduct, and 3) evaluation\/guidance. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with appropriate psychotropic drug use. Secondary outcomes are the overall frequency of psychotropic drug use, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, activities of daily living, psychotropic drug side effects and adverse events (including cognition, comorbidity, and mortality). Besides, a process analysis on the intervention will be carried out.","This study is expected to improve the appropriateness of psychotropic drug prescription for neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing

with dementia has been demonstrated in an explanatory cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with two DCM researchers carrying out the DCM intervention. In order to be able to inform daily practice, we studied DCM effectiveness in a pragmatic cRCT involving a wide range of care homes with trained nursing staff carrying out the intervention.","Dementia special care units were randomly assigned to DCM or usual care. Nurses from the intervention care homes received DCM training and conducted the 4-months DCM-intervention twice during the study. The primary outcome was agitation, measured with the Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory (CMAI). The secondary outcomes included residents' neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) and quality of life, and staff stress and job satisfaction. The nursing staff made all measurements at baseline and two follow-ups at 4-month intervals. We used linear mixed-effect models to test treatment and time effects.","34 units from 11 care homes, including 434 residents and 382 nursing staff members, were randomly assigned. Ten nurses from the intervention units completed the basic and advanced DCM training. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant effect on the CMAI (mean difference between groups 2\u00b74, 95% CI -2\u00b77 to 7\u00b76; p\u200a=\u200a0\u00b734). More NPSs were reported in the intervention group than in usual care (p\u200a=\u200a0\u00b702). Intervention staff reported fewer negative and more positive emotional reactions during work (p\u200a=\u200a0\u00b702). There were no other significant effects.","Our pragmatic findings did not confirm the effect on the primary outcome of agitation in the explanatory study. Perhaps the variability of the extent of implementation of DCM may explain the lack of effect.","Dutch Trials Registry NTR2314."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen, Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Dementia-care mapping is a person-centred care method that may alleviate both the resident and the staff problems. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dementia-care mapping in nursing-home dementia care.","The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial, with nursing homes grouped in clusters. Studywise minimisation is the allocation method. Nursing homes in the intervention group will receive a dementia-care-mapping intervention, while the control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is resident agitation, to be assessed with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. The secondary outcomes are resident neuropsychiatric symptoms, assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory--Nursing Homes and quality of life, assessed with Qualidem and the EQ-5D. The staff outcomes are stress reactions, job satisfaction and job-stress-related absenteeism, and staff turnover rate, assessed with the Questionnaire about Experience and Assessment of Work, the General Health Questionnaire-12, and the Maastricht Job Satisfaction Scale for Health Care, respectively. We will collect the data from the questionnaires and electronic registration systems. We will employ linear mixed-effect models and cost-effectiveness analyses to evaluate the outcomes. We will use structural equation modelling in the secondary analysis to evaluate the plausibility of a theoretical model regarding the effectiveness of the dementia-care mapping intervention. We will set up process analyses, including focus groups with staff, to determine the relevant facilitators of and barriers to implementing dementia-care mapping broadly.","A novelty of dementia-care mapping is that it offers an integral person-centred approach to dementia care in nursing homes. The major strengths of the study design are the large sample size, the cluster-randomisation, and the one-year follow-up. The generalisability of the implementation strategies may be questionable because the motivation for person-centred care in both the intervention and control nursing homes is above average. The results of this study may be useful in improving the quality of care and are relevant for policymakers.","The trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR2314."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2012 van de Ven et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van de Ven","ForeName":"Geertje","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, P.O.

The patients were predominately female and aged 75 years and over. The follow-up period ranged from three months to one year. The number of assessments ranged from two to five, and 12 different assessment instruments were used to study NPS. Aberrant motor behavior, depression, anxiety, and euphoria showed decline over time, and psychosis remained constant whereas apathy, agitation, irritability, and disinhibition increased over time.

Using the CMAI, 85% of the patients showed at least one symptom of agitation, of which general restlessness was observed most frequently (44%). Other frequently observed symptoms with prevalence rates of 30% were cursing or verbal aggression, constant request for attention, negativism, repetitious sentences, mannerisms, pacing, and complaining. Physically aggressive symptoms such as hitting, kicking, biting occurred less often (less than 13%).","Prevalence rates of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Dutch nursing home patients with dementia residing in SCUs are high, especially agitation and apathy. Insight into the prevalence rates of individual symptoms in patients with dementia has important practical consequences for the accurate planning of staff allotment and stresses the need for patient oriented care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zuidema","ForeName":"Sytse U","Initials":"SU","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Kalorama, Beek-Ubbergen, The Netherlands.

Recent safety warnings about increased frequency of cerebrovascular adverse events in elderly patients who use atypical antipsychotics mean that physicians now face a dilemma when weighing the benefits and risks of use of antipsychotics in this patient group. This study systematically reviews the reporting of adverse events of antipsychotics used to treat BPSD in randomised, controlled trials (RCTs).","We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo and CINAHL databases (search period 1980 or 1986-April 2005) and the Cochrane controlled trials register (2005) for RCTs that used intention-to-treat analysis to evaluate the efficacy and harms of antipsychotics used to treat BPSD. Two independent reviewers assessed the reporting of adverse events.","Screening of 930 abstracts identified 12 eligible RCTs (2809 patients). Most participants were elderly people (mean age 80 years) with Alzheimer's, vascular or mixed dementia. Studies lasted from 3 to 16 weeks. Adverse events, though common, were described heterogeneously and incompletely. No RCT fulfilled all Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials requirements for the reporting of harms. Atypical antipsychotics caused fewer extrapyramidal symptoms and less somnolence than typical antipsychotics, but these differences disappeared when dosages were increased. Only one trial reported cerebrovascular adverse events, with a number needed to harm of 14 (95% CI 8, 41).","At lower doses atypical antipsychotics may cause fewer adverse events in the treatment of BPSD, but there is uncertainty about their cerebrovascular safety profile. The RCTs included in this systematic review described adverse events too incompletely and heterogeneously to allow generation of clear treatment recommendations, and they do not provide sufficient evidence to support recent safety warnings. Better reporting on harms in RCTs is needed to enable rational treatment decisions with respect to use of antipsychotics for BPSD."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Iersel","ForeName":"Marianne B","Initials":"MB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatrics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zuidema","ForeName":"Sytse U","Initials":"SU"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond T C M","Initials":"RT"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Olde Rikkert","ForeName":"Marcel G M","Initials":"MG"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Drugs Aging","NlmUniqueID":"9102074","ISSNLinking":"1170-229X"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Behavior","QualifierName":"drug effects"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Databases, Bibliographic"},{"DescriptorName":"Databases, Factual"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["drug therapy","etiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"51"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"1","Day":"21","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16245958","22104","10.2165\/00002512-200522100-00004"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2004 Aug;19(8):803-4","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15290706"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2005 Mar;17 (1):4-12;
