Randomization was stratified by country and median number of beds in each country in a 1:1 ratio.","The PACE Steps to Success Program is a multicomponent intervention to integrate basic nonspecialist palliative care in nursing homes. Using a train-the-trainer approach, an external trainer supports staff in nursing homes to introduce a palliative care approach over the course of 1 year following a 6-steps program. The steps are (1) advance care planning with residents and family, (2) assessment, care planning, and review of needs and problems, (3) coordination of care via monthly multidisciplinary review meetings, (4) delivery of high-quality care focusing on pain and depression, (5) care in the last days of life, and (6) care after death.","The primary resident outcome was comfort in the last week of life measured after death by staff using the End-of-Life in Dementia Scale Comfort Assessment While Dying (EOLD-CAD; range, 14-42). The primary staff outcome was knowledge of palliative care reported by staff using the Palliative Care Survey (PCS; range, 0-1).","Concerning deceased residents, we collected 551 of 610 questionnaires from staff at baseline and 984 of 1178 postintervention in 37 intervention and 36 control homes. Mean (SD) age at time of death ranged between 85.22 (9.13) and 85.91 (8.57) years, and between 60.6% (160\/264) and 70.6% (190\/269) of residents were women across the different groups. Residents' comfort in the last week of life did not differ between intervention and control groups (baseline-adjusted mean difference, -0.55; 95% CI, -1.71 to 0.61; P\u2009=\u2009.35). Concerning staff, we collected 2680 of 3638 questionnaires at baseline and 2437 of 3510 postintervention in 37 intervention and 38 control homes. Mean (SD) age of staff ranged between 42.3 (12.1) and 44.1 (11.7) years, and between 87.2% (1092\/1253) and 89% (1224\/1375) of staff were women across the different groups. Staff in the intervention group had statistically significantly better knowledge of palliative care than staff in the control group, but the clinical difference was minimal (baseline-adjusted mean difference, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02-0.05; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

Legally, an Advanced Euthanasia Directive (AED) can replace direct communication if a patient can no longer express his own wishes. In the past decade, an exponential number of persons with dementia (PWDs) share a euthanasia request with their physician. The impact this on physicians, and the consequent support needs, remained unknown. Our objective was to gain more insight into the experiences and needs of Dutch general practitioners and elderly care physicians when handling a euthanasia request from a person with dementia (PWD).","We performed a qualitative interview study. Participants were recruited via purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the conventional thematic content analysis.","Eleven general practitioners (GPs) and elderly care physicians with a variety of experience and different attitudes towards euthanasia for PWD were included. Euthanasia requests appeared to have a major impact on physicians. Difficulties they experienced were related to timing, workload, pressure from and expectations of relatives, society's negative view of dementia in combination with the 'right to die' view, the interpretation of the law and AEDs, ethical considerations, and communication with PWD and relatives. To deal with these difficulties, participants need support from colleagues and other professionals. Although elderly care physicians appreciated moral deliberation and support by chaplains, this was hardly mentioned by GPs.","Euthanasia requests in dementia seem to place an ethically and emotionally heavy burden on Dutch GPs and elderly care physicians. The awareness of, and access to, existing and new support mechanisms needs further exploration."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schuurmans","ForeName":"Jaap","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"General practice Ottenhoff, B.

future medical treatment and care with family and healthcare providers, and to record these goals and preferences if appropriate. Because general practitioners (GPs) often have long-lasting relationships with people with dementia, GPs seem most suited to initiate ACP. However, ACP with people with dementia in primary care is uncommon. Although several barriers and facilitators to ACP with people with dementia have already been identified in earlier research, evidence gaps still exist. We therefore aimed to further explore barriers and facilitators for ACP with community-dwelling people with dementia.","A qualitative design, involving all stakeholders in the care for community-dwelling people with dementia, was used. We conducted semi-structured interviews with community dwelling people with dementia and their family caregivers, semi structured interviews by telephone with GPs and a focus group meeting with practice nurses and case managers. Content analysis was used to define codes, categories and themes.","Ten face to face interviews, 10 interviews by telephone and one focus group interview were conducted. From this data, three themes were derived: development of a trust-based relationship, characteristics of an ACP conversation and the primary care setting. ACP is facilitated by a therapeutic relationship between the person with dementia\/family caregiver and the GP built on trust, preferably in the context of home visits. Addressing not only medical but also non-medical issues soon after the dementia diagnosis is given is an important facilitator during conversation. Key barriers were: the wish of some participants to postpone ACP until problems arise, GPs' time restraints, concerns about the documentation of ACP outcomes and concerns about the availability of these outcomes to other healthcare providers.","ACP is facilitated by an open relationship based on trust between the GP, the person with dementia and his\/her family caregiver, in which both medical and non-medical issues are addressed. GPs' availability and time restraints are barriers to ACP. Transferring ACP tasks to case managers or practice nurses may contribute to overcoming these barriers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tilburgs","ForeName":"Bram","Initials":"B","Identifier":"0000-0003-1588-004X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of IQ healthcare, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

recommendations advocating the involvement of nursing home residents and their family members in care planning and the development of personalized care plans.","The main aim was to analyze the effects of training nursing home staff in the implementation of SDM on agreement of residents' 'life-and-care plans' with the recommendations (primary outcome) and on family caregivers' quality of life and sense of competence, and staff's job satisfaction (secondary outcomes).","In the intervention condition, staff attended a training program on the use of SDM with residents and family caregivers in the care planning process. In the control condition, care planning as usual took place. For the primary outcome, in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of the care plans were performed. Multivariate Permutation Tests were applied to assess the impact on secondary outcomes.","Forty-nine residents and family caregivers and 34 professionals were involved. Overall, many of the care plans developed during the intervention showed a high level of agreement with the care planning recommendations. Both Italian and Dutch care plans showed improvement in the number of clear problem statements (p < 0.001). In Italy, significant improvements (p < 0.05) were also found regarding specific care objectives, documentation of objectives met, and of residents and families' involvement. No impact was found on secondary outcomes.","The involvement of residents and family caregivers in care planning contributed to an improvement of the residents' care plans, but it did not have an effect on family caregivers and staff outcomes."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mariani","ForeName":"Elena","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ healthcare), Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chattat","ForeName":"Rabih","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ottoboni","ForeName":"Giovanni","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Radboudumc Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Joachimen Anna, Center for Specialized Geriatric Care, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ healthcare), Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Radboudumc Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Kalorama Foundation, Beek-Ubbergen, The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Engels","ForeName":"Yvonne","Initials":"Y","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Anaesthesiology, Pain and Palliative Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["education","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Occupations","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Italy"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Care planning policy","care planning regulations","care plans","dementia residents","elderly residents","family caregivers","nursing homes","shared decision-making"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30010130","JAD180279","10.3233\/JAD-180279"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29924837","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"04"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"13","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2018"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS One"},"ArticleTitle":"Barriers and facilitators for GPs in dementia advance care planning: A systematic integrative review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e0198535"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0198535","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Due to the disease's progressive nature, advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for people with early stage dementia. General practitioners (GPs) should initiate ACP because of their longstanding relationships with their patients and their early involvement with the disease, however ACP is seldom applied.","To determine the barriers and facilitators faced by GPs related to ACP with people with dementia.","We systematically searched the relevant databases for papers published between January 1995 and December 2016, using the terms: primary healthcare, GP, dementia, and ACP. We conducted a systematic integrative review following Whittemore and Knafl's method. Papers containing empirical data about GP barriers and\/or facilitators regarding ACP for people with dementia were included. We evaluated quality using the Mixed-Method-Appraisal-Tool and analyzed data using qualitative content analysis.","Ten qualitative, five quantitative, and one mixed-method paper revealed four themes: timely initiation of ACP, stakeholder engagement, important aspects of ACP the conversation, and prerequisites for ACP. Important barriers were: uncertainty about the timing of ACP, how to plan for an uncertain future, lack of knowledge about dementia, difficulties assessing people with dementia's decisional capacities, and changing preferences. Facilitators for ACP were: an early start when cognitive decline is still mild, inclusion of all stakeholders, and discussing social and medical issues aimed at maintaining normal life.","Discussing future care is difficult due to uncertainties about the future and the decisional capacities of people with dementia. Based on the facilitators, we recommend that GPs use a timely and goal-oriented approach and involve all stakeholders. ACP discussions should focus on the ability of people with dementia to maintain normal daily function as well as on their quality of life, instead of end-of-life-discussions only. GPs need training to acquire knowledge and skills to timely initiate collaborative ACP discussions."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tilburgs","ForeName":"Bram","Initials":"B","Identifier":"0000-0003-1588-004X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

While in Indonesia cancer is accepted as a disease requiring caregiving, dementia is still considered \"a normal condition.\" These differences might affect the experiences of caregivers, especially those relating to social health, the subject of our study. We aim to describe and compare the lived experiences of family caregivers of patients with cancer (PWC) with those of patients with dementia (PWD) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and to explore the role of their social health in these experiences.","A qualitative design was applied. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with PWC and PWD caregivers in two outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital. The constant comparative method was applied to analyze the data that were interpreted using the concept of social health to explore the experiences of the caregivers. We used Atlas.ti software.","Three themes were identified: problems with caregiving, dealing with problems, and beliefs in caregiving. We found more similarities than differences in the experiences of caregivers in both groups. Half of the categories were related to social health: challenges, consequences, hiding, social support, and the caregiver's approach. The organization of dementia care is characterized by simplicity and direct ties between medical specialists, PWD, and caregivers, whereas cancer care encounters coordination problems.","Family caregivers of both groups mostly had similar experiences of the caregiving process. Gaining a better understanding of the specific experiences of caregivers, and their social health, opens new avenues for interventions to improve their quality of life."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kristanti","ForeName":"Martina Sinta","Initials":"MS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"IQ

The categories of team collaboration, communication skills and nursing home policy were found to be facilitators to the implementation process, whereas regulations, lack of funding and of involvement of family caregivers were the main barriers. Family attitudes towards SDM could be both. The main difference between countries concerned the residents' cognitive status that influenced their degree of involvement.","Communication skills training for professionals, training of family caregivers, and involvement of the management in the implementation process seem to be crucial factors in successfully implementing SDM in nursing homes, and increasing the involvement of families and dementia residents in decision-making."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mariani","ForeName":"Elena","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ healthcare), Radboud University Medical Centre , Nijmegen , The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"b Department of Psychology, Alma Mater Studiorum , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare (IQ healthcare), Radboud University Medical Centre , Nijmegen , The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"c Kalorama Foundation , Beek-Ubbergen , The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"d Radboud Alzheimer Center."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koopmans","ForeName":"Raymond","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"d Radboud Alzheimer Center."},{"Affiliation":"e Department of Primary and Community Care , Radboud University Medical Centre , Nijmegen , The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"f Joachim & Anna, Center for Specialized Geriatric Care , Nijmegen , The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Engels","ForeName":"Yvonne","Initials":"Y","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"g Department of Anaesthesiology, Pain and Palliative Medicine , Radboud University Medical Centre , Nijmegen , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chattat","ForeName":"Rabih","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Department of Psychology, Alma Mater Studiorum , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Italy"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Netherlands"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality Improvement","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","family","nursing homes","shared decision-making","staff"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27869501","10.1080\/13607863.2016.1255715"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26537133","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"04","Day":"07"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-684X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"14","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Nov","Day":"04"}},"Title":"BMC palliative care","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Palliat Care"},"ArticleTitle":"Identification of the palliative phase in people with dementia: a variety of opinions between healthcare professionals.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"56"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12904-015-0053-8","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["People with dementia can benefit from a palliative care approach.

These QIs represent key elements of the organisation of good clinical practice, such as the availability of palliative care teams, the availability of special facilities to provide palliative care for patients and their relatives, and the presence of educational interventions for professionals.
