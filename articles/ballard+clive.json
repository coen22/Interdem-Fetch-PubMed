of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) includes (1) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), (2) delirium-onset, and (3) psychiatric-onset presentations. The purpose of our review is to determine whether there is sufficient information yet available to justify development of diagnostic criteria for each of these. Our goal is to achieve evidence-based recommendations for the recognition of DLB at a predementia, symptomatic stage. We propose operationalized diagnostic criteria for probable and possible mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies, which are intended for use in research settings pending validation for use in clinical practice. They are compatible with current criteria for other prodromal neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Although there is still insufficient evidence to propose formal criteria for delirium-onset and psychiatric-onset presentations of DLB, we feel that it is important to characterize them, raising the index of diagnostic suspicion and prioritizing them for further investigation.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).

management.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"512-519"},"ELocationID":"10.1136\/jnnp-2019-322702","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Visual hallucinations are common in older people and are especially associated with ophthalmological and neurological disorders, including dementia and Parkinson's disease. Uncertainties remain whether there is a single underlying mechanism for visual hallucinations or they have different disease-dependent causes. However, irrespective of mechanism, visual hallucinations are difficult to treat. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded a research programme to investigate visual hallucinations in the key and high burden areas of eye disease, dementia and Parkinson's disease, culminating in a workshop to develop a unified framework for their clinical management. Here we summarise the evidence base, current practice and consensus guidelines that emerged from the workshop.Irrespective of clinical condition, case ascertainment strategies are required to overcome reporting stigma. Once hallucinations are identified, physical, cognitive and ophthalmological health should be reviewed, with education and self-help techniques provided. Not all hallucinations require intervention but for those that are clinically significant, current evidence supports pharmacological modification of cholinergic, GABAergic, serotonergic or dopaminergic systems, or reduction of cortical excitability. A broad treatment perspective is needed, including carer support. Despite their frequency and clinical significance, there is a paucity of randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evidence where the primary outcome is an improvement in visual hallucinations. Key areas for future research include the development of valid and reliable assessment tools for use in mechanistic studies and clinical trials, transdiagnostic studies of shared and distinct mechanisms and when and how to treat visual hallucinations.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

debilitating feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with a more rapid course of decline. Current evidence from postmortem and neuroimaging studies implicates frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, with reported disruptions in monoaminergic pathways. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated methylomic variation associated with AD psychosis in 3 key brain regions implicated in the etiology of psychosis (prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus) in postmortem brain samples from 29 AD donors with psychosis and 18 matched AD donors without psychosis. We identified psychosis-associated methylomic changes in a number of loci, with these genes being enriched in known schizophrenia-associated genetic and epigenetic variants. One of these known loci resided in the AS3MT gene-previously implicated in schizophrenia in a large GWAS meta-analysis. We used bisulfite-pyrosequencing to confirm hypomethylation across 4 neighboring CpG sites in the ASM3T gene. Finally, our regional analysis nominated multiple CpG sites in TBX15 and WT1, which are genes that have been previously implicated in AD. Thus one potential implication from our study is whether psychosis-associated variation drives reported associations in AD case-control studies.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2020.

occurs in up to 50% of individuals and is associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes. Atypical antipsychotics, first developed for schizophrenia, are commonly used in AD\u2009+\u2009P, suggesting shared mechanisms. Despite this implication, little empirical research has been conducted to examine whether there are mechanistic similarities between AD\u2009+\u2009P and schizophrenia. In this study, we tested whether polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia was associated with AD\u2009+\u2009P. Schizophrenia PRS was calculated using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium data at ten GWAS p value thresholds (P) in 3111 AD cases from 11 cohort studies characterized for psychosis using validated, standardized tools. Association between PRS and AD\u2009+\u2009P status was tested by logistic regression in each cohort individually and the results meta-analyzed. The schizophrenia PRS was associated with AD\u2009+\u2009P at an optimum P of 0.01. The strongest association was for delusions where a one standard deviation increase in PRS was associated with a 1.18-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.06-1.3; p\u2009=\u20090.001). These new findings point towards psychosis in AD-and particularly delusions-sharing some genetic liability with schizophrenia and support a transdiagnostic view of psychotic symptoms across the

substantial acute inflammatory trauma, which may constitute a significant insult to the degenerating brain. Research suggests that an injury of this kind can affect memory and thinking in the future but it is unclear whether, and how, inflammatory trauma injures the brain. The impact of Acute SystematiC inflammation upon cerebRospinal fluId and blood BiomarkErs of brain inflammation and injury in Dementia: a study in acute hip fracture patients (ASCRIBED) explores this relationship, to understand the effect of inflammation on the progression of dementia.","This protocol describes a multi-centre sample collection observational study. The study utilises the unique opportunity provided by hip fracture operations undertaken via spinal anaesthesia to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, to investigate the impact of acute brain inflammation caused by hip fracture on the exacerbation of dementia. We will recruit 200 hip fracture patients with a diagnosis or evidence of dementia; and 200 hip fracture patients without dementia. We will also recruit 'Suitable informants', individuals in regular contact with the patient, to provide further proxy evidence of a patient's potential cognitive decline. We will compare these 400 samples with existing CSF and blood samples from a cohort of dementia patients who had not experienced a systemic inflammatory response due to injury. This will provide a comparison between patients with and without dementia who are suffering a systemic inflammatory response; with stable patients living with dementia.","We will test the hypothesis that hip fracture patients living with dementia show elevated markers of brain inflammation, as well as neuronal injury and Alzheimer-related plaque pathology, in comparison to (1) stable patients living with dementia and (2) hip fracture patients without dementia, as measured by biomarkers in CSF and blood. The findings will address the hypothesis that systemic inflammatory events can exacerbate underlying dementia and inform the search for new treatments targeting inflammation in dementia.","ISRCTN43803769 .

with associated genetic and molecular culprits. However, target-based therapeutic strategies have so far proved ineffective. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology harnessing the transcriptional changes associated with Alzheimer's disease to develop a high content quantitative disease phenotype that can be used to repurpose existing drugs. Firstly, the Alzheimer's disease gene expression landscape covering severe disease stage, early pathology progression, cognitive decline and animal models of the disease has been defined and used to select a set of 153 drugs tending to oppose disease-associated changes in the context of immortalised human cancer cell lines. The selected compounds have then been assayed in the more biologically relevant setting of iPSC-derived cortical neuron cultures. It is shown that 51 of the drugs drive expression changes consistently opposite to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. It is hoped that the iPSC profiles will serve as a useful resource for drug repositioning within the context of neurodegenerative disease and potentially aid in generating novel multi-targeted therapeutic strategies."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Williams","ForeName":"Gareth","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London Bridge, London, SE1 1UL, UK. gareth.2.williams@kcl.ac.uk."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gatt","ForeName":"Ariana","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London Bridge, London, SE1 1UL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clarke","ForeName":"Earl","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London Bridge, London, SE1 1UL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corcoran","ForeName":"Jonathan","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London Bridge, London, SE1 1UL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Doherty","ForeName":"Patrick","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London Bridge, London, SE1 1UL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chambers","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London Bridge, London, SE1 1UL, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"College of Medicine and Health, University of Exeter, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"102001\/Z\/13\/Z","Agency":"Wellcome Trust (Wellcome)","Country":"International"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"06"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Transl Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"101562664","ISSNLinking":"2158-3188"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["drug therapy","genetics"]},{"DescriptorName":"Drug Repositioning"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurons","QualifierName":"metabolism"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"22"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"3","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31492831","10.1038\/s41398-019-0555-x","10.1038\/s41398-019-0555-x","PMC6731247"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"31357238","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"09","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"09","Day":"29"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1750-3639","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"30","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2020","Month":"01"}},"Title":"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)","ISOAbbreviation":"Brain Pathol"},"ArticleTitle":"Small vessel disease pathological changes in neurodegenerative and vascular dementias concomitant with autonomic dysfunction.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"191-202"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/bpa.12769","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"We performed a clinicopathological study to assess the burden of small vessel disease (SVD) type of pathological changes in elderly demented subjects, who had clinical evidence of autonomic dysfunction, either carotid sinus hypersensitivity or orthostatic hypotension or both or had exhibited unexpected repeated falls. Clinical and neuropathological diagnoses in 112 demented subjects comprised dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mixed dementia (mostly AD-DLB) and vascular dementia (VaD). Of these, 12 DLB subjects had no recorded unexpected falls in life and therefore no evidence of concomitant autonomic dysfunction. A further 17 subjects were assessed as aging controls without significant pathology or signs of autonomic dysfunction. We quantified brain vascular pathological changes and determined severities of neurodegenerative lesions including \u03b1-synuclein pathology. We found moderate-severe vascular changes and high-vascular pathology scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in all neurodegenerative dementias and as expected in VaD compared to similar age controls. Arteriolosclerosis, perivascular spacing and microinfarcts were frequent in the basal ganglia and frontal white matter (WM) across all dementias, whereas small infarcts (<5\u00a0mm) were restricted to VaD. In a sub-set of demented subjects, we found that vascular pathology scores were correlated with WM hyperintensity volumes determined by MRI in life (P\u00a0<\u00a00.02). Sclerotic index values were increased by ~50% in both the WM and neocortex in all dementias compared to similar age controls. We found no evidence for increased \u03b1-synuclein deposition in subjects with autonomic dysfunction. Our findings suggest greater SVD pathological changes occur in the elderly diagnosed with neurodegenerative dementias including DLB and who develop autonomic dysfunction. SVD changes may not necessarily manifest in clinically overt symptoms but they likely confound motor or cognitive dysfunction. We propose dysautonomia promotes chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to impact upon aging-related neurodegenerative disorders and characterize their end-stage clinical syndromes.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 International Society of

This review aimed to 1) catalogue the different types of AD-related socioeconomic costs described in the literature; 2) assess the challenges and gaps of existing approaches to measuring these costs; and 3) analyze and discuss the implications for stakeholders including policymakers, healthcare systems, associations, advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers looking to improve the ability to generate reliable data that can guide evidence-based decision making. A centrally emergent theme from this review is that it is challenging to gauge the true value of policies, programs, or interventions in the ADRD arena given the long-term, progressive nature of the disease, its insidious socioeconomic impact beyond the patient and the formal healthcare system, and the complexities and current deficiencies (in measures and real-world data) in accurately calculating the full costs to society. There is therefore an urgent need for all stakeholders to establish a common understanding of the challenges in evaluating the full cost of ADRD and define approaches that allow us to measure these costs more accurately, with a view to prioritizing evidence-based solutions to mitigate this looming public health

Use of analgesics in people with dementia has increased during the last decade, in particular opioid analgesics with high potential for adverse effects.","This article presents a systematic review of the current evidence for safety and tolerability of analgesic drugs from randomized controlled trials in people with dementia. Relevant trials were identified by a literature search in the EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases from inception to November 2018. The search included the main terms 'dementia' and 'analgesic' or their subterms, and was filtered to limit results to clinical trials.","Although pain treatment is increasingly recognized as an important clinical issue in people with advanced dementia, there is currently a lack of evidence to support safety evaluations of commonly used analgesics in this group. To inform treatment decisions and enable care providers to appropriately monitor patients at risk of adverse effects, it is necessary to conduct well-designed clinical trials to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of analgesics in people with dementia, with particular emphasis on harmful effects of long-term opioid use as well as short-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Erdal","ForeName":"Ane","Initials":"A","Identifier":"0000-0003-3802-7383","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care , Centre for Elderly and Nursing Home Medicine, University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b University of Exeter Medical School , Exeter , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vahia","ForeName":"Ipsit Vihang","Initials":"IV","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"c McLean Institute for Technology in Psychiatry and Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services , McLean Hospital , Belmont , MA , USA."},{"Affiliation":"d Department of Psychiatry , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA , USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Husebo","ForeName":"Bettina Sandgathe","Initials":"BS","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care , Centre for Elderly and Nursing Home Medicine, University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway."},{"Affiliation":"e Department of Health and Care , Municipality of Bergen , Bergen , Norway."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Expert Opin Drug Saf","NlmUniqueID":"101163027","ISSNLinking":"1474-0338"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Analgesics"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Analgesics, Opioid"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Analgesics","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects"]},{"DescriptorName":"Analgesics, Opioid","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects"]},{"DescriptorName":"Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal","QualifierName":["administration & dosage","adverse effects"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"complications"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Pain","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Acetaminophen","adverse effects","analgesic","buprenorphine","dementia","nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug","opioid","pregabalin","safety"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"5","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"5","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31038371","10.1080\/14740338.2019.1614166"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30944040","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"28"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"04","Day":"03"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"Evaluating the effects of the novel GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in Alzheimer's disease: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial (ELAD study).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"191"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s13063-019-3259-x","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue currently approved for type 2 diabetes and obesity. Preclinical evidence in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease suggests that liraglutide exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing amyloid oligomers, normalising synaptic plasticity and cerebral glucose uptake, and increasing the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate after 12\u2009months of treatment with liraglutide in participants with Alzheimer's disease compared to those who are receiving placebo.","ELAD is a 12-month, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIb trial of liraglutide in participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia. A total of 206 participants will be randomised to receive either liraglutide or placebo as a daily injection for a year. The primary outcome will be the change in cerebral glucose metabolic rate in the cortical regions (hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate) from baseline to follow-up in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. The key secondary outcomes are the change from baseline to 12\u2009months in z scores for clinical and cognitive measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and Executive domain scores of the Neuropsychological Test Battery, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living) and the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically important changes in safety assessments. Other secondary outcomes are 12-month change in magnetic resonance imaging volume, diffusion tensor imaging parameters, reduction in microglial activation in a subgroup of participants, reduction in tau formation and change in amyloid levels in a subgroup of participants\u00a0measured by tau and amyloid imaging, and changes in composite scores using support machine vector analysis in the treatment group compared with the placebo group.","Alzheimer's disease is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. As available treatments are only symptomatic, the search for disease-modifying therapies is a priority. If the ELAD trial is successful, liraglutide and GLP-1 analogues will represent an important class of compounds to be further evaluated in clinical trials for Alzheimer's treatment.","ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01843075 .

have prompted a drive towards clinical studies in prodromal or preclinical states. However, carrying out clinical trials in early disease stages is extremely challenging-a key reason being the unfeasibility of using classical outcome measures of dementia trials (eg, conversion to dementia) and the lack of validated surrogate measures so early in the disease process. The Deep and Frequent Phenotyping (DFP) study aims to resolve this issue by identifying a set of markers acting as indicators of disease progression in the prodromal phase of disease that could be used as indicative outcome measures in proof-of-concept trials.","The DFP study is a repeated measures observational study where participants will be recruited through existing parent cohorts, research interested lists\/databases, advertisements and memory clinics. Repeated measures of both established (cognition, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of pathology, structural MRI markers of neurodegeneration) and experimental modalities (functional MRI, magnetoencephalography and\/or electroencephalography, gait measurement, ophthalmological and continuous smartphone-based cognitive and other assessments together with experimental CSF, blood, tear and saliva biomarkers) will be performed. We will be recruiting male and female participants aged >60 years with prodromal AD, defined as absence of dementia but with evidence of cognitive impairment together with AD pathology as assessed using PET imaging or CSF biomarkers. Control participants without evidence of AD pathology will be included at a 1:4 ratio.","The study gained favourable ethical opinion from the South Central-Oxford B NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 17\/SC\/0315; approved on 18 August 2017; amendment 13 February 2018). Data will be shared with the scientific community no more than 1\u2009year following completion of study and data assembly."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Animal studies have suggested that the process of adult neurogenesis might be altered at the earliest phases of disease onset. The relationship between AD progression and adult neurogenesis in the human brain is, however, not well understood. Here, we present a systematic review of the postmortem studies that investigated changes in human adult neurogenesis in the AD brain. We present findings from 11 postmortem studies that were identified by a systematic search within the literature, focusing on what markers of neurogenesis were used, which stages of AD were investigated, and whether the studies had any confounding information that could potentially hinder clear interpretation of the presented data. In addition, we also review studies that examined transcriptomic changes in human AD postmortem brains and reveal upregulated expression of neural progenitor and proliferation markers and downregulated expression of later neurogenic markers in AD. Taken together, the existing literature seems to suggest that the overall level of human adult neurogenesis is reduced during the later stages of AD, potentially due to failed maturation and integration of new-born neurons.

population of patients with AD continues to grow, no new therapies have been approved in more than a decade. Many clinical trials of single-agent therapies have failed to affect disease progression or symptoms compared with placebo. The complex pathophysiology of AD may necessitate combination treatments rather than monotherapy. The goal of this narrative literature review is to describe types of combination therapy, review the current clinical evidence for combination therapy regimens (both symptomatic and disease-modifying) in the treatment of AD, describe innovative clinical trial study designs that may be effective in testing combination therapy, and discuss the regulatory and drug development landscape for combination therapy. Successful combination therapies in other complex disorders, such as human immunodeficiency virus, may provide useful examples of a potential path forward for AD

and tolerability of idalopirdine 60\u200amg\/day as adjunctive therapy in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). This extension study was a continuation of Studies 1 and 2 of the Phase III development program for idalopirdine and comprised a 28-week open-label treatment period (\"OLEX\") and a subsequent 24-week open-label treatment period with memantine (\"MEMOLEX\") in selected patients. The previous studies had shown no evidence of efficacy with idalopirdine as adjunctive treatment to donepezil but with good tolerability (of 1,791 patients randomized, 1,609 [90%] completed the double-blind studies). Of those, 1,463 patients (91%) entered the open-label extension study. During the 28-week OLEX period, the percentage of patients having treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) ranged between 51% and 59% across the treatment groups originating from the lead-in studies. During the subsequent 24-week MEMOLEX period, 51% of the patients had TEAEs. Increases in liver enzymes (occurring in 1-3% of trial participants) were transient and no new safety signals were observed with longer term exposure. No consistent effects demonstrating benefits with idalopirdine were observed on efficacy parameters when patients transitioned to 60\u200amg in the extension study.

Secondary outcomes were activities of daily living (ADL), total medication, staff distress, and clinical global impressions of change (CGIC).","During the active intervention, all 3 QoL measures worsened, 2 significantly (QUALID P\u00a0=\u00a0.04; QUALIDEM P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). However, follow-up analysis from month 4 to 9 showed an intervention effect for EQ-VAS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003) and QUALIDEM total score (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01; care relationship P\u00a0=\u00a0.02; positive affect P\u00a0=\u00a0.04, social relations P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). The secondary outcomes of ADL function, reduction of medication (including psychotropics) and staff distress, improved significantly from baseline to month 4. Intervention effects were also demonstrated for CGIC at month 4 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.023) and 9 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.009), mainly because of deterioration in the control group.","Temporarily, the QoL decreased in the intervention group, leading to our hypothesis that health care staff may be overwhelmed by the work-intensive COSMOS intervention period. However, the decrease reversed significantly during follow-up, indicating a potential learning effect. Further, the intervention group improved in ADL function and received less medication, and staff reported less distress and judged COSMOS as able to bring about clinically relevant change. This suggests that nonpharmacologic multicomponent interventions require long follow-up to ensure uptake and beneficial effects."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

The main aim of the IDEAL-2 study is to investigate how and why, over time, people with dementia and their primary carers might vary in their capability to live well with dementia, whilst exploring both their use of health and care services and their unmet needs.","IDEAL-2 will build on the Improving the experience of Dementia and Enhancing Active Life (IDEAL) cohort of 1547 people (who, at recruitment between July 2014 and July 2016, had mild-to-moderate dementia), and their 1283 primary carers in Great Britain. The existing cohort will be enriched with additional participants with mild-to-moderate dementia (and their primary carers where available and willing) from the following groups: people with rarer forms of dementia, and\/or those who are \u226590\u00a0years or\u2009<\u200965\u00a0years of age at time of recruitment. We will assess the primary outcome, capability to live well with dementia, and the factors influencing it using questionnaires at yearly intervals for 3 years. Additionally, we will seek to link the cohort data with administrative data to obtain information about health service use. Some participants will be invited for in-depth face-to-face interviews. The cohort study will be supplemented by linked research focusing on: the co-production of new measures of living well; including the perspectives of people with advanced dementia living in residential care settings; including people with dementia from black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups; and understanding the experience of people living with undiagnosed dementia.","IDEAL-2 will provide evidence about the key indicators of, and factors associated with, living well over the course of dementia and how these differ for particular subgroups. It will tell us which combinations of services and support are most beneficial and cost-effective. Moreover, the IDEAL-2 study will gather evidence from under-researched groups of people with dementia, who are likely to have their own distinct perceptions of living well."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Silarova","ForeName":"Barbora","Initials":"B","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2473-2527","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Research in Ageing and Cognitive Health (REACH), College of Medicine and Health, South Cloisters, St Luke's Campus, Exeter, EX1 2LU, UK.

induced by \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and shifts the balance from canonical towards non-canonical Wnt signalling. Canonical (Wnt-\u03b2-catenin) signalling promotes synapse stability, while non-canonical (Wnt-PCP) signalling favours synapse retraction; thus A\u03b2-driven synapse loss is mediated by Dkk1. Here we show that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) co-activates both arms of Wnt signalling through physical interactions with Wnt co-receptors LRP6 and Vangl2, to bi-directionally modulate synapse stability. Furthermore, activation of non-canonical Wnt signalling enhances A\u03b2 production, while activation of canonical signalling suppresses A\u03b2 production. Together, these findings identify a pathogenic-positive feedback loop in which A\u03b2 induces Dkk1 expression, thereby activating non-canonical Wnt signalling to promote synapse loss and drive further A\u03b2 production. The Swedish familial AD variant of APP (APP) more readily co-activates non-canonical, at the expense of canonical Wnt activity, indicating that its pathogenicity likely involves direct effects on synapses, in addition to increased A\u03b2 production. Finally, we report that pharmacological inhibition of the A\u03b2-Dkk1-A\u03b2 positive feedback loop with the drug fasudil can restore the balance between Wnt pathways, prevent dendritic spine withdrawal in vitro, and reduce A\u03b2 load in vivo in mice with advanced amyloid pathology. These results clarify a relationship between A\u03b2 accumulation and synapse loss and provide direction for the development of potential disease-modifying treatments."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elliott","ForeName":"Christina","Initials":"C","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2838-8612","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, 5 Cutcombe Road, London, SE5 9RT, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rojo","ForeName":"Ana I","Initials":"AI","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria La Paz (IdiPaz), Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ribe","ForeName":"Elena","Initials":"E","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2854-2576","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Broadstock","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, 5 Cutcombe Road, London, SE5 9RT, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Xia","ForeName":"Weiming","Initials":"W","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Veterans Affairs, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford, MA, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morin","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Veterans Affairs, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford, MA, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Semenov","ForeName":"Mikhail","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Veterans Affairs, Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, Bedford, MA, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Baillie","ForeName":"George","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, Scotland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cuadrado","ForeName":"Antonio","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED), Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria La Paz (IdiPaz), Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), Madrid, Spain."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Al-Shawi","ForeName":"Raya","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Royal Free Campus, University College London, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Simons","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5007-6674","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Royal Free Campus, University College London, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Killick","ForeName":"Richard","Initials":"R","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8815-3436","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, King's College London, 5 Cutcombe Road, London, SE5 9RT, UK.

nearly universal in dementia, a condition occurring in more than 40 million people worldwide. BPSD present a considerable treatment challenge for prescribers and healthcare professionals. Our purpose was to prioritize existing and emerging treatments for BPSD in Alzheimer's disease (AD) overall, as well as specifically for agitation and psychosis.","International Delphi consensus process. Two rounds of feedback were conducted, followed by an in-person meeting to ratify the outcome of the electronic process.","2015 International Psychogeriatric Association meeting.","Expert panel comprised of 11 international members with clinical and research expertise in BPSD management.","Consensus outcomes showed a clear preference for an escalating approach to the management of BPSD in AD commencing with the identification of underlying causes. For BPSD overall and for agitation, caregiver training, environmental adaptations, person-centered care, and tailored activities were identified as first-line approaches prior to any pharmacologic approaches. If pharmacologic strategies were needed, citalopram and analgesia were prioritized ahead of antipsychotics. In contrast, for psychosis, pharmacologic options, and in particular, risperidone, were prioritized following the assessment of underlying causes. Two tailored non-drug approaches (DICE and music therapy) were agreed upon as the most promising non-pharmacologic treatment approaches for BPSD overall and agitation, with dextromethorphan\/quinidine as a promising potential pharmacologic candidate for agitation. Regarding future treatments for psychosis, the greatest priority was placed on pimavanserin.","This international consensus panel provided clear suggestions for potential refinement of current

We analyse the longitudinal course of NPS in patients with mild dementia.","A longitudinal cohort study of 223 patients with mild dementia and annual assessments using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for 5\u00a0years.","A total 1043 NPI assessments, representing 97% of all possible measurements of living cohort members, were analysed. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were common at baseline, and only a moderate increase in total NPS score from 15 to 17 with no increase in the proportion with high NPI total scores. Ninety seven percent scored \u226516, and 49% scored \u226536 on NPI total score at least once during follow-up. Individual NPS fluctuated and often reappeared. The most common symptoms ever reported was apathy (83%), depression (63%), appetite (63%), and aberrant motor behavior (60%). Cognitive decline was associated with higher NPI total score and several NPI items, but only the frequency of apathy increased significantly with time. Lewy body dementia was associated with higher NPI total score and psychotic symptoms. Alzheimer's disease was associated with increase in apathy.","Severe NPS are already common at time of dementia diagnosis, and the increase in overall severity over 5\u00a0years was moderate.

Expert commentary: The current justification for antipsychotic use in the context of the changing landscape of prescribing and provide a view on the most promising alternative candidates to this class of drug are appraised."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Creese","ForeName":"Byron","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a University of Exeter Medical School , University of Exeter , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Da Silva","ForeName":"Miguel Vasconcelos","Initials":"MV","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a University of Exeter Medical School , University of Exeter , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Johar","ForeName":"Iskandar","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Department of Old Age Psychiatry , Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a University of Exeter Medical School , University of Exeter , UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"05","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Expert Rev Neurother","NlmUniqueID":"101129944","ISSNLinking":"1473-7175"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychomotor Agitation","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotic Disorders","QualifierName":"drug therapy"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Agitation","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","atypical antipsychotics","dementia","psychosis"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"5","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"5","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29764230","10.1080\/14737175.2018.1476140"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29725986","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"08","Day":"06"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1179-1969","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"35","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"06"}},"Title":"Drugs & aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Drugs Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"Efficacy and Safety of Analgesic Treatment for Depression in People with Advanced Dementia: Randomised, Multicentre, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial (DEP.PAIN.DEM).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"545-558"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s40266-018-0546-2","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Chronic pain and depression often co-occur, and pain may exacerbate depression in people with dementia.","The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of analgesic treatment for depression in nursing home patients with advanced dementia and clinically significant depressive symptoms.","We conducted a multicentre, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 47 nursing homes, including 162 nursing home patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0years with dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination\u2009\u2264\u200920) and depression (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia\u2009\u2265\u20098). Patients were randomised to receive active analgesic treatment (paracetamol or buprenorphine transdermal system) or identical placebo for 13\u00a0weeks. The main outcome measure was the change in depression (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia) from baseline to 13\u00a0weeks, assessed using linear mixed models with fixed effects for time, intervention and their interaction in the models. Secondary outcomes were to assess whether any change in depression was secondary to change in pain (Mobilisation-Observation-Behaviour-Intensity-Dementia-2 Pain Scale) and adverse events.","The mean depression change was -\u00a00.66 (95% confidence interval -\u00a02.27 to 0.94) in the active group (n\u2009=\u200980) and -\u00a03.30 (-\u00a04.68 to -1.92) in the placebo group (n\u2009=\u200982). The estimated treatment effect was 2.64 (0.55-4.72, p\u2009=\u20090.013), indicating that analgesic treatment had no effect on depressive symptoms from baseline to 13\u00a0weeks while placebo appeared to ameliorate depressive symptoms. There was no significant reduction in pain in the active treatment group (paracetamol and buprenorphine combined) vs. placebo; however, a subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in pain for paracetamol vs. placebo [by -\u00a01.11 (-\u00a02.16 to -\u00a00.06, p\u2009=\u20090.037)] from week 6 to 13 without a change in depression. Buprenorphine did not have significant effects on depression [3.04 (-\u00a00.11 to 6.19), p\u2009=\u20090.059] or pain [0.47 (-\u00a00.77 to 1.71), p\u2009=\u20090.456] from 0 to 13\u00a0weeks. Thirty-five patients were withdrawn from the study because of adverse reactions, deterioration or death: 25 (31.3%) during active treatment [23 (52.3%) who received buprenorphine], and ten (12.2%) in the placebo group. The most frequently occurring adverse events were psychiatric (17\u00a0adverse reactions) and neurological (14\u00a0adverse reactions).","Analgesic treatment did not reduce depression while placebo appeared to improve depressive symptoms significantly by comparison, possibly owing to the adverse effects of active buprenorphine. The risk of adverse events warrants caution when prescribing buprenorphine for people with advanced dementia.","ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02267057 (registered 7 July, 2014) and Norwegian Medicines Agency

No safe or effective pharmacological treatment is approved for psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pimavanserin versus placebo in patients with Alzheimer's disease psychosis.","We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre (with multiple affiliated nursing home sites across the UK) study. We included participants of either sex who were aged 50 years or older with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease and psychotic symptoms including visual or auditory hallucinations, delusions, or both. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks of oral treatment with either pimavanserin (two 17 mg tablets daily) or placebo, with use of permuted block sizes of four and stratified by baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score (<6 or \u22656) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) psychosis score (<12 or \u226512). Participants, caregivers, the study sponsor, and study personnel at the clinic site were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 6 in the NPI-NH psychosis score for pimavanserin versus placebo in the modified intention-to-treat population. Sustained benefit and safety of pimavanserin were assessed through week 12. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02035553.","Between Jan 16, 2014, and Oct 27, 2016, 345 participants across 133 nursing homes were screened, of whom 181 were randomly assigned treatment (n=90 pimavanserin and n=91 placebo). 178 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Mean total baseline NPI-NH psychosis scores were 9\u00b75 (SD 4\u00b78) for the pimavanserin group and 10\u00b70 (5\u00b76) for the placebo group. Mean change in the NPI-NH psychosis score at week 6 was -3\u00b776 points (SE 0\u00b765) for pimavanserin and -1\u00b793 points (0\u00b763) for placebo (mean difference -1\u00b784 [95% CI -3\u00b764 to -0\u00b704], Cohen's d=-0\u00b732; p=0\u00b7045). By week 12, no significant advantage for pimavanserin versus placebo was observed for the overall study population (treatment difference -0\u00b751 [95% CI -2\u00b723 to 1\u00b721]; p=0\u00b7561). Common adverse events were falls (21 [23%] of 90 participants in the pimavanserin group vs 21 [23%] of 91 in the placebo group), urinary tract infections (20 [22%] vs 25 [28%]), and agitation (19 [21%] vs 13 [14%]). Eight (9%) participants on pimavanserin and 11 (12%) on placebo discontinued treatment because of adverse events. No detrimental effect was observed on cognition or motor function in either group.","Pimavanserin showed efficacy in patients with Alzheimer's disease psychosis at the primary endpoint (week 6) with an acceptable tolerability profile and without negative effect on cognition. Further follow-up to week 12 did not show significant advantage for pimavanserin versus placebo.","ACADIA Pharmaceuticals."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

dementia living in nursing homes: A cluster-randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e1002500"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pmed.1002500","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Agitation is a common, challenging symptom affecting large numbers of people with dementia and impacting on quality of life (QoL). There is an urgent need for evidence-based, cost-effective psychosocial interventions to improve these outcomes, particularly in the absence of safe, effective pharmacological therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a person-centred care and psychosocial intervention incorporating an antipsychotic review, WHELD, on QoL, agitation, and antipsychotic use in people with dementia living in nursing homes, and to determine its cost.","This was a randomised controlled cluster trial conducted between 1 January 2013 and 30 September 2015 that compared the WHELD intervention with treatment as usual (TAU) in people with dementia living in 69 UK nursing homes, using an intention to treat analysis. All nursing homes allocated to the intervention received staff training in person-centred care and social interaction and education regarding antipsychotic medications (antipsychotic review), followed by ongoing delivery through a care staff champion model. The primary outcome measure was QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy). Secondary outcomes were agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]), neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version [NPI-NH]), antipsychotic use, global deterioration (Clinical Dementia Rating), mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia), unmet needs (Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly), mortality, quality of interactions (Quality of Interactions Scale [QUIS]), pain (Abbey Pain Scale), and cost. Costs were calculated using cost function figures compared with usual costs. In all, 847 people were randomised to WHELD or TAU, of whom 553 completed the 9-month randomised controlled trial. The intervention conferred a statistically significant improvement in QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy Z score 2.82, p = 0.0042; mean difference 2.54, SEM 0.88; 95% CI 0.81, 4.28; Cohen's D effect size 0.24). There were also statistically significant benefits in agitation (CMAI Z score 2.68, p = 0.0076; mean difference 4.27, SEM 1.59; 95% CI -7.39, -1.15; Cohen's D 0.23) and overall neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-NH Z score 3.52, p < 0.001; mean difference 4.55, SEM 1.28; 95% CI -7.07,-2.02; Cohen's D 0.30). Benefits were greatest in people with moderately severe dementia. There was a statistically significant benefit in positive care interactions as measured by QUIS (19.7% increase, SEM 8.94; 95% CI 2.12, 37.16, p = 0.03; Cohen's D 0.55). There were no statistically significant differences between WHELD and TAU for the other outcomes. A sensitivity analysis using a pre-specified imputation model confirmed statistically significant benefits in DEMQOL-Proxy, CMAI, and NPI-NH outcomes with the WHELD intervention. Antipsychotic drug use was at a low stable level in both treatment groups, and the intervention did not reduce use. The WHELD intervention reduced cost compared to TAU, and the benefits achieved were therefore associated with a cost saving. The main limitation was that antipsychotic review was based on augmenting processes within care homes to trigger medical review and did not in this study involve proactive primary care education. An additional limitation was the inherent challenge of assessing QoL in this patient group.","These findings suggest that the WHELD intervention confers benefits in terms of QoL, agitation, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, albeit with relatively small effect sizes, as well as cost saving in a model that can readily be implemented in nursing homes. Future work should consider how to facilitate sustainability of the intervention in this setting.","ISRCTN Registry

Alzheimer's disease (AD) share overlapping neuropathologies, including neuronal pre-programmed cell death (PPCD), and clinical impairments and disabilities. Multiple clinical trials targeting mechanisms based on the Amyloid Hypothesis of AD have so far failed, indicating that it is prudent for new drug developments to also pursue mechanisms independent of the Amyloid Hypothesis. To address these issues, we have proposed the use of an animal model of concussion\/TBI as a supplement to AD transgenic mice to provide an indication of an AD drug candidate's potential for preventing PPCD and resulting progression towards dementia in AD.","We searched PubMed\/Medline and the references of identified articles for background on the neuropathological progression of AD and its implications for drug target identification, for AD clinical trial criteria used to assess disease modification outcomes, for plasma biomarkers associated with AD and concussion\/TBI, neuropathologies and especially PPCD, and for methodological critiques of AD and other neuropsychiatric clinical trial methods.","We identified and address seven issues and highlight the Thal-Sano AD 'Time to Onset of Impairment' Design for possible applications in our clinical trials. Diverse and significant pathological cascades and indications of self-induced neuronal PPCD were found in concussion\/TBI, anoxia, and AD animal models. To address the dearth of peripheral markers of AD and concussion\/TBI brain pathologies and PPCD we evaluated Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) enriched for neuronal origin, including exosomes. In our concussion\/TBI, anoxia and AD animal models we found evidence consistent with the presence of time-dependent PPCD and (-)-phenserine suppression of neuronal self-induced PPCD. We hence developed an extended controlled release formulation of (-)-phenserine to provide individualized dosing and stable therapeutic brain concentrations, to pharmacologically interrogate PPCD as a drug development target. To address the identified problems potentially putting any clinical trial at risk of failure, we developed exploratory AD and concussion\/TBI clinical trial designs.","Our findings inform the biomarker indication of progression of pathological targets in neurodegenerations and propose a novel approach to these conditions through neuronal protection against self-induced PPCD."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at

whether idalopirdine, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 receptor antagonist, is effective for symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate AD.","Three randomized clinical trials that included 2525 patients aged 50 years or older with mild to moderate AD (study 1: n\u2009=\u2009933 patients at 119 sites; study 2: n\u2009=\u2009858 at 158 sites; and study 3: n\u2009=\u2009734 at 126 sites).

Dose group efficacy required a significant benefit over placebo for the primary end point and 1 or more key secondary end points. Safety data and adverse event profiles were recorded.","Among 2525 patients randomized in the 3 trials (mean age, 74 years; mean baseline ADAS-Cog total score, 26; between 62% and 65% of participants were women), 2254 (89%) completed the studies. In study 1, the mean change in ADAS-Cog total score between baseline and 24 weeks was 0.37 for the 60-mg dose of idalopirdine group, 0.61 for the 30-mg dose group, and 0.41 for the placebo group (adjusted mean difference vs placebo, 0.05 [95% CI, -0.88 to 0.98] for the 60-mg dose group and 0.33 [95% CI, -0.59 to 1.26] for the 30-mg dose group).

While mitochondrial dysfunction, including perturbation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex, is evident in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it remains unclear whether the observed OXPHOS deficits may be associated with TOM alterations.","To correlate TOM subunits with OXPHOS complex proteins in AD.","Postmortem neocortex (BA40) from AD and age-matched controls were processed to obtain mitochondrial enriched homogenates for the measurement of Tom20, Tom22, Tom40, and Tom70 as well as components of OXPHOS complex I-V by immunoblotting.","Tom20 and Tom70 immunoreactivities were significantly reduced in AD, as were components of OXPHOS complex I and III. Both Tom20 and Tom70 positively correlated with complex III and V, while Tom20 also correlated withcomplex IV.","Reductions in certain TOM subunits and their correlations with specific OXPHOS complex proteins suggest that an impaired mitochondrial transportation system may contribute to previously observed oxidative phosphorylation deficits in AD.

Current available symptom treatment strategies are based on monoaminergic, cholinergic and glutaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Relatively robust evidence exists for cholinesterase inhibitors for cognitive impairment in LBD and in Parkinson's disease for antidepressants, clozapine and recently pimavanserin for psychosis. interpidine (RVT 101) and nelotanserin are currently under investigation. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive stimulation, physical exercises and neuromodulation strategies, may be useful in Parkinson's disease but have not yet been tested in dementias. Disease-modifying approaches are aimed at preventing, slowing or ameliorating the production, aggregation and deposition of pathological proteins, including immunotherapy targeting \u03b1-synuclein and an ongoing trial using ambroxol which increases glucocerebrosidase activity to lower the levels of the protein alpha-synuclein. Other disease-modifying clinical trials are using agents to augment insulin signalling, stem cell therapy, reducing amyloid pathology and gene therapy."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Velayudhan","ForeName":"Latha","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, Kings College London, Box PO 70, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ffytche","ForeName":"Dominic","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, Kings College London, Box PO 70, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, Kings College London, Box PO 70, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK."},{"Affiliation":"University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aarsland","ForeName":"Dag","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neurosciences, Kings College London, Box PO 70, De Crespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK.

Few studies have assessed the accuracy of the 2005 criteria applied prospectively in newly diagnosed patients who have been followed longitudinally.","To explore the correlation between clinical and pathological diagnoses in patients with DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD).","From a prospective referral cohort study with enriched recruitment of patients with DLB and PDD, we included the first 56 patients coming to autopsy. Patients had mild dementia at inclusion and were followed annually until death with standardized clinical assessments. Pathological assessment was performed blind to clinical information according to standardized protocols and consensus criteria for DLB.","20 patients received a pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disease; the corresponding clinical diagnoses were probable DLB (n\u200a=\u200a11), PDD (n\u200a=\u200a5), probable (n\u200a=\u200a2) or possible (n\u200a=\u200a2) Alzheimer's disease (AD). Of 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB, 11 had DLB\/PDD and 3 had AD at pathology. One patient with clinically possible DLB fulfilled criteria for pathological AD. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values for probable DLB were 73%, 93%, 79%, and 90%.","Our findings suggest that the international clinical consensus criteria for DLB perform reasonably well. However, false positive and false negative diagnoses still occur, indicating that the criteria need to be improved, that biomarkers may be needed, and that neuropathological feedback is vital to improve

dementia. There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

a systematic review, patient and public consultation and consensus recommendations.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1-192"},"ELocationID":"10.3310\/hta21260","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["There is currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)]. The systematic review protocol is registered as PROSPERO CRD42015027346.","The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment

and management of dementia with Lewy bodies: Fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"88-100"},"ELocationID":"10.1212\/WNL.0000000000004058","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) Consortium has refined its recommendations about the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of DLB, updating the previous report, which has been in widespread use for the last decade. The revised DLB consensus criteria now distinguish clearly between clinical features and diagnostic biomarkers, and give guidance about optimal methods to establish and interpret these. Substantial new information has been incorporated about previously reported aspects of DLB, with increased diagnostic weighting given to REM sleep behavior disorder and iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy. The diagnostic role of other neuroimaging, electrophysiologic, and laboratory investigations is also described. Minor modifications to pathologic methods and criteria are recommended to take account of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, to add previously omitted Lewy-related pathology categories, and to include assessments for substantia nigra neuronal loss. Recommendations about clinical management are largely based upon expert opinion since randomized controlled trials in DLB are few. Substantial progress has been made since the previous report in the detection and recognition of DLB as a common and important clinical disorder. During that period it has been incorporated into DSM-5, as major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. There remains a pressing need to understand the underlying neurobiology and pathophysiology of DLB, to develop and deliver clinical trials with both symptomatic and disease-modifying agents, and to help patients and carers worldwide to inform themselves about the disease, its prognosis, best available treatments, ongoing research, and how to get adequate support.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Author(s).

Recently, there has been a considerable focus on the relationship between GBA mutations and emergence of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in these diseases. Here, we review the literature in this area, with a particular focus, including meta-analysis, on the key neuropsychiatric symptoms of cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression in Parkinson's disease. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that GBA mutations are associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk of cognitive impairment. In addition, our novel meta-analyses of psychosis and depression showed a 1.8- and 2.2-fold increased risk respectively associated with GBA mutations, although due to possible bias and heterogeneity the depression findings should be interpreted with caution. While the precise mechanisms which increase susceptibility to neurodegeneration in GBA carriers are not known, evidence of greater cortical Lewy body pathology, reduced patterns of cortical activation, and hippocampal pathology in animal models are all consistent with a direct effect of GBA mutations on these symptoms. Extension of this work in DLB and individuals without neurodegeneration will be important in further characterizing how GBA mutations increase risk for PD and DLB and influence disease course.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Creese","ForeName":"Byron","Initials":"B","Identifier":"0000-0001-6490-6037","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bell","ForeName":"Emily","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Johar","ForeName":"Iskandar","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Francis","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aarsland","ForeName":"Dag","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"05","Day":"26"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet","NlmUniqueID":"101235742","ISSNLinking":"1552-4841"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"EC 3.2.1.45","NameOfSubstance":"Glucosylceramidase"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognition","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Glucosylceramidase","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Heterozygote"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Mutation"},{"DescriptorName":"Parkinson Disease","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Phenotype"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["GBA","depression","psychosis"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2017","Month":"03","Day":"03"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2017","Month":"04","Day":"07"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2017","Month":"04","Day":"20"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"5","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"5","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"5","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28548708","10.1002\/ajmg.b.32549"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28490260","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"01","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1744-8360","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"Expert review of neurotherapeutics","ISOAbbreviation":"Expert Rev Neurother"},"ArticleTitle":"Emerging treatments for Alzheimer's disease for non-amyloid and non-tau targets.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"683-695"},"ELocationID":"10.1080\/14737175.2017.1326818","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The number of people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is growing as a result of an ageing global population.

Amyloid and tau are key pathological markers of AD with ongoing trials targeting both.

This includes treatments for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and potentially disease modifying therapies. The studies included in this review have been obtained from searches of PubMed and clinical trials databases. Expert commentary: There is a renewed energy in identifying better treatments for behavioural symptoms of AD using both novel drugs and repositioning existing drugs. Lack of success in clinical trials of drugs targeting amyloid and tau have led to a surge in targeting alternative mechanisms.

Improvements in pain management behaviour and staff confidence were seen in homes where training was delivered in a care home setting across the care team with good manager buy-in. Family involvement in pain management was highlighted as an area for improvement. Goal attainment in residents was significantly improved across the cohort, although no significant change in pain was seen.","This study shows good initial feasibility of the PAIN-Dem intervention and provides valuable insight into training and support paradigms that deliver successful learning and behaviour change.

Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care than patients with Alzheimer's disease. Health-care costs and, importantly, caregiver burden, are also reported to be higher in dementia with Lewy bodies than in Alzheimer's disease. It is probable that causative factors for this less favourable prognosis are the increased prevalence and early emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, and the challenge of accurate diagnosis. Evidence concerning quality of life and hospital admission rates is limited, despite their clinical and economic relevance.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Visual hallucinations and illusions are thought to be caused by specific cognitive and higher visual function deficits and patients who develop such symptoms early in the disease course have greater rates of cognitive decline and progression to dementia. To date, no studies have investigated whether such deficits are found prior to the onset of PD psychosis.","Here we compare baseline cognitive, biomarker (structural imaging and cerebrospinal fluid) and other PD psychosis risk factor data in patients who go on to develop illusions or hallucinations within 3-4 years of follow-up in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort of newly diagnosed PD.","Of n=423 patients with PD, n=115 (27%) reported predominantly illusions with the median time of onset at 19.5 months follow-up. At study entry these patients had reduced CSF amyloid A\u00df, lower olfaction scores, higher depression scores and increased REM sleep behaviour disorder symptoms compared to patients without early onset PD psychosis but no differences in cognitive, higher visual or structural imaging measures. A subset of patients with early onset formed hallucinations (n=21) had reduced higher visual function at baseline, cortical thinning in parietal, occipital and frontal cortex and reduced hippocampal volume.","The findings suggest early onset illusions and formed hallucinations are linked to amyloid pathology in PD and point to a difference in the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of illusions and formed hallucinations, with implications for their respective links to future cognitive decline."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

dementia and is pathologically characterized by \u03b1-synuclein positive cytoplasmic inclusions, with varying amounts of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and hyperphosphorylated tau (tau) aggregates in addition to synaptic loss. A dysfunctional ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), the major proteolytic pathway responsible for the clearance of short lived proteins, may be a mediating factor of disease progression and of the development of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates. In the present study, protein expression of a key component of the UPS, the RPT6 subunit of the 19S regulatory complex was determined. Furthermore, the main proteolytic-like (chymotrypsin- and PGPH-) activities have also been analyzed. The middle frontal (Brodmann, BA9), inferior parietal (BA40), and anterior cingulate (BA24) gyrus' cortex were selected as regions of interest from Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD, n\u200a=\u200a31), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n\u200a=\u200a44), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n\u200a=\u200a16), and control (n\u200a=\u200a24) brains. Clinical and pathological data available included the MMSE score. DLB, PDD, and AD were characterized by significant reductions of RPT6 (one-way ANOVA, p\u200a<\u200a0.001; Bonferroni post hoc test) in prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex compared with controls. Strong associations were observed between RPT6 levels in prefrontal, parietal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus and cognitive impairment (p\u200a=\u200a0.001, p\u200a=\u200a0.001, and p\u200a=\u200a0.008, respectively). These findings highlight the involvement of the UPS in Lewy body dementia and indicate that targeting the UPS may have the potential to slow down or reduce the progression of cognitive impairment in DLB and PDD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alghamdi","ForeName":"Amani","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"King's

In recent years, research has focused on the pre-dementia stages of cognitive impairment in PD, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Several longitudinal studies have shown that MCI is a harbinger of dementia in PD, although the course is variable, and stabilization of cognition - or even reversal to normal cognition - is not uncommon. In addition to limbic and cortical spread of Lewy pathology, several other mechanisms are likely to contribute to cognitive decline in PD, and a variety of biomarker studies, some using novel structural and functional imaging techniques, have documented in vivo brain changes associated with cognitive impairment. The evidence consistently suggests that low cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-\u03b2, a marker of comorbid Alzheimer disease (AD), predict future cognitive decline and dementia in PD. Emerging genetic evidence indicates that in addition to the APOE*\u03b54 allele (an established risk factor for AD), GBA mutations and SCNA mutations and triplications are associated with cognitive decline in PD, whereas the findings are mixed for MAPT polymorphisms. Cognitive enhancing medications have some effect in PD dementia, but no convincing evidence that progression from MCI to dementia can be delayed or prevented is available, although cognitive training has shown promising results."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aarsland","ForeName":"Dag","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"KCL-PARCOG

transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 isoforms known, TGF\u03b21 deficits have been widely reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and studied as a potential therapeutic target. In contrast, the status of TGF\u03b22, which has been shown to mediate amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-mediated neuronal death, are unclear both in AD and in Lewy body dementias (LBD) with differential neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden.","To measure neocortical TGF\u03b22 levels and their correlations with neuropathological and clinical markers of disease severity in a well-characterized cohort of AD as well as two clinical subtypes of LBD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), known to manifest relatively high and low A\u03b2 plaque burden, respectively.","Postmortem samples from temporal cortex (BA21) were measured for TGF\u03b22 using a Luminex-based platform, and correlated with scores for neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, \u03b1-synuclein pathology, dementia severity (as measured by annual decline of Mini-Mental State Examination scores) as well as soluble and total fractions of brain A\u03b242.","TGF\u03b22 was significantly increased in AD and DLB, but not in PDD. TGF\u03b22 also correlated with scores for neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies (within the LBD group), dementia severity, and soluble A\u03b242 concentration, but not with neuritic plaque scores, total A\u03b242, or monomeric \u03b1-synuclein immunoreactivity.","TGF\u03b22 is increased in the temporal cortex of AD and DLB, and its correlations with neuropathological and clinical markers of disease severity as well as with soluble A\u03b242 load suggest a potential pathogenic role in mediating the neurotoxicity of non-fibrillar A\u03b2.

Nevertheless, international (i.e. the European Medicines Agency in Europe) and national (i.e. the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK and the Italian Drug Agency) regulatory agencies issued safety warnings against AP use in dementia in 2004 and 2009.","The aim of this study is to investigate the short- and long-term impact of safety warnings on the use of APs in UK and Italian persons with dementia using two nationwide databases: The Health Improvement Network (THIN) from the UK and the Health Search Database-Cegedim-Strategic Data-Longitudinal Patient Database (HSD-CSD-LPD) from Italy.","We calculated the overall quarterly prevalence of AP use by class and by individual drug in persons with dementia aged \u226565\u00a0years and used generalized linear models to explore the effect of the safety warnings.","We identified 58,497 and 10,857 individuals aged \u226565\u00a0years with dementia from the THIN and HSD-CSD-LPD databases, respectively, over the period 2000-2012. After the 2004 warnings, the use of atypical APs decreased, whereas the use of conventional APs increased, in Italy and the UK until 2009. However, the trend for APs individually showed that the use of risperidone\/olanzapine decreased, whereas the use of quetiapine increased in both countries. After the 2009 warnings (until 2012), the use of atypical and conventional APs decreased in the UK (from 11 to 9 and 5 to 3\u00a0%, respectively), but such use increased in Italy (from 11 to 18 and 9 to 14\u00a0%, respectively).","The 2004 warnings led to a reduction in the use of olanzapine and risperidone and increased the use of quetiapine\/conventional APs in both countries. From 2009, the use of APs decreased in persons with dementia in the UK but not in Italy. Possible reasons for the difference in AP use between the two countries include a more proactive approach towards reducing the use of APs in the UK than in Italy."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sultana","ForeName":"Janet","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Via Consolare Valeria, 98125, Messina, Sicily, Italy."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Dr. Molewaterplein 50, 3015 GE, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fontana","ForeName":"Andrea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Unit of Biostatistics, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, Viale Cappuccini 1, 71013, San Giovanni Rotondo, Bari, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Giorgianni","ForeName":"Francesco","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Via Consolare Valeria, 98125, Messina, Sicily, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pasqua","ForeName":"Alessandro","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Health Search, Italian College of General Practitioners, Via Sestese, 61, 50141, Florence, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cricelli","ForeName":"Claudio","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Health Search, Italian College of General Practitioners, Via Sestese, 61, 50141, Florence, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spina","ForeName":"Edoardo","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Via Consolare Valeria, 98125, Messina, Sicily, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gambassi","ForeName":"Giovanni","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, 00168, Rome, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ivanovic","ForeName":"Jelena","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Italian Drug Agency (AIFA), 181 Via del Tritone, 00187, Rome, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ferrajolo","ForeName":"Carmen","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Experimental Medicine, Pharmacology section, Campania Regional Centre of Pharmacovigilance and Pharmacoepidemiology, Second University of Naples, 7 Via L.

neurochemical findings postulated to underlie the limited efficacy of presynaptically-targeted cholinergic replacement therapies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the loss of M1-G-protein coupling has been associated with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) burden in AD, the status of M1 coupling to G-proteins in Parkinson's disease-related or mixed dementias is unclear.","To test the hypothesis that M1 receptor uncoupling is correlated with A\u03b2 burden, we aimed to study muscarinic M1 neurochemical parameters in neurodegenerative dementias characterized by low and high A\u03b2 loads.","M1 receptors, M1 coupling to G-proteins as well as A\u03b2 were measured in postmortem frontal cortex of a cohort of longitudinally assessed patients with Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD, low A\u03b2 load) and AD with significant subcortical cerebrovascular disease (AD + CVD, high A\u03b2 load).","We found unchanged levels of M1 receptors in both dementia groups, while M1 coupling was reduced only in AD + CVD (p\u200a<\u200a0.01). Furthermore, A\u03b2 concentration was significantly increased only in AD + CVD, and correlated negatively with M1-G-protein coupling in the dementia groups.","Our study suggests that loss of M1 coupling to G-proteins may be a neurochemical feature of neurodegenerative dementias with high cortical A\u03b2 burden, and that cholinergic replacement therapies may be more efficacious for PDD due to low A\u03b2 burden."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lee","ForeName":"Jasinda

body dementias.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"84"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s13041-016-0264-9","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) regulates axonal growth cone extension, and increased CRMP2 phosphorylation may lead to axonal degeneration. Axonal and synaptic pathology is an important feature of Lewy body dementias (LBD), but the state of CRMP2 phosphorylation (pCRMP2) as well as its correlations with markers of neurodegeneration have not been studied in these dementias. Hence, we measured CRMP2 phosphorylation at Thr509, Thr514 and Ser522, as well as markers of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2), tau-phosphorylation, \u03b1-synuclein and synaptic function in the postmortem neocortex of a longitudinally assessed cohort of LBD patients characterized by low (Parkinson's disease dementia, PDD) and high (dementia with Lewy bodies, DLB) burden of Alzheimer type pathology. We found specific increases of pCRMP2 at Thr514 in DLB, but not PDD. The increased CRMP2 phosphorylation correlated with fibrillogenic A\u03b2 as well as with losses of markers for axon regeneration (\u03b2-III-tubulin) and synaptic integrity (synaptophysin) in LBD. In contrast, pCRMP2 alterations did not correlate with tau-phosphorylation or \u03b1-synuclein, and also appear unrelated to immunoreactivities of putative upstream kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5, as well as to protein phosphatase 2A. In conclusion, increased pCRMP2 may underlie the axonal pathology of DLB, and may be a novel therapeutic target. However, antecedent signaling events as well as the nature of pCRMP2 association with A\u03b2 and other neuropathologic markers require further study."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Xing","ForeName":"Huayang","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

described as having problems with reasoning, planning, judgment, and memory caused by impaired blood flow to the brain and damage to the blood vessels resulting from events such as stroke. There are a variety of etiologies that contribute to the development of vascular cognitive impairment and VaD, and these are often associated with other dementia-related pathologies such as Alzheimer disease. The diagnosis of VaD is difficult due to the number and types of lesions and their locations in the brain. Factors that increase the risk of vascular diseases such as stroke, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking also raise the risk of VaD. Therefore, controlling these risk factors can help lower the chances of developing VaD.

There is an urgent need for a clinical trial in this patient group. Subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia is the most common variant of vascular dementia. This randomised trial will investigate whether use of calcium channel blockade with amlodipine, a commonly used agent, can provide the first evidence-based pharmacological treatment for subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia.","This is a randomised controlled trial of calcium channel blockade with Amlodipine For the treatment oF subcortical ischaEmic vasCular demenTia (AFFECT) to test the hypothesis that treatment with amlodipine can improve outcomes for these patients in a phase IIb, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial. The primary outcome is the change from baseline to 12\u00a0months in the Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (VADAS-cog). Secondary outcomes include cognitive function, executive function, clinical global impression of change, change in blood pressure, quantitative evaluation of lesion accrual based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, non-cognitive dementia symptoms, care-giver burden and care-giver health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and institutionalisation. A total of 588 patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either amlodipine or placebo, recruited from sites across the UK and enrolled in the trial for 104\u00a0weeks.","There are no treatments licensed for vascular dementia. The most common subtype is subcortical ischaemic vascular dementia (SIVD). This study is designed to investigate whether amlodipine can produce benefits compared to placebo in established SIVD. It is estimated that the numbers of people with VaD and SIVD will increase globally in the future and the results of this study should inform important treatment decisions.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN31208535 .

the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 to enable person-centred care for people with dementia and their carers (DCM-EPIC) in care homes: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"300"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s13063-016-1416-z","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Up to 90 % of people living with dementia in care homes experience one or more behaviours that staff may describe as challenging to support (BSC). Of these agitation is the most common and difficult to manage. The presence of agitation is associated with fewer visits from relatives, poorer quality of life and social isolation. It is recommended that agitation is treated through psychosocial interventions. Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 (DCM\u2122) is an established, widely used observational tool and practice development cycle, for ensuring a systematic approach to providing person-centred care. There is a body of practice-based literature and experience to suggests that DCM\u2122 is potentially effective but limited robust evidence for its effectiveness, and no examination of its cost-effectiveness, as a UK health care intervention. Therefore, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of DCM\u2122 in the UK is urgently needed.","A pragmatic, multi-centre, cluster-randomised controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM\u2122) plus Usual Care (UC) versus UC alone, where UC is the normal care delivered within the care home following a minimum level of dementia awareness training. The trial will take place in residential, nursing and dementia-specialist care homes across West Yorkshire, Oxfordshire and London, with residents with dementia. A random sample of 50 care homes will be selected within which a minimum of 750 residents will be registered. Care homes will be randomised in an allocation ratio of 3:2 to receive either intervention or control. Outcome measures will be obtained at 6 and 16 months following randomisation. The primary outcome is agitation as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, at 16 months post randomisation. Key secondary outcomes are other BSC and quality of life. There will be an integral cost-effectiveness analysis and a process evaluation.","The protocol was refined following a pilot of trial procedures. Changes include replacement of a questionnaire, whose wording caused some residents distress, to an adapted version specifically designed for use in care homes, a change to the randomisation stratification factors, adaption in how the staff measures are collected to encourage greater compliance, and additional reminders to intervention homes of when mapping cycles are due, via text message.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82288852 .

in which pain is an important clinical issue that is often underdiagnosed. However, it is unclear whether decreased pain complaints in patients with AD result from elevated pain tolerance or an impaired ability to communicate sensations. Here, we explored if AD-related pathology is present in key regions of the pain pathway and assessed whether nociceptive thresholds to acute noxious stimulation are altered in the double-mutant APPswe \u00d7 PS1.M146V (TASTPM) transgenic mouse model of AD. TASTPM mice exhibited an age-dependant cognitive deficit at the age of 6 months, but not at 4 months, a deficit that was accompanied by amyloid plaques in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. In the spinal cord, \u03b2-amyloid (APP\/A\u03b2) immunoreactivity was observed in dorsal and ventral horn neurons, and the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) was significantly reduced, while the expression of the inhibitory peptides enkephalins was increased in TASTPM dorsal horn, consistent with an increased inhibitory tone. TASTPM mice displayed reduced sensitivity to acute noxious heat, which was reversed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. This study suggests that increased inhibition and decreased excitation in the spinal cord may be responsible for the reduced thermal sensitivity associated with AD-related pathology."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aman","ForeName":"Yahyah","Initials":"Y","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson

Genetic drivers result in a high frequency of Alzheimer's pathology in these individuals, evident from neuroimaging, biomarker, and neuropathological findings, and a high incidence of cognitive decline and dementia. However, cognitive assessment is challenging, and diagnostic methods have not been fully validated for use in these patients; hence, early diagnosis remains difficult. Evidence regarding the benefits of cholinesterase inhibitors and other therapeutic options to treat or delay progressive cognitive decline or dementia is very scarce. Despite close similarities with late-onset Alzheimer's disease, individuals with Down's syndrome respond differently to treatment, and a targeted approach to drug development is thus necessary.

We evaluated the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions, exercise, and social interaction, in combination with antipsychotic review, to reduce apathy in people with dementia living in nursing homes in a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT).","Well-being and health for people with dementia (WHELD) program included a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial cluster RCT involving people with dementia living in 16 nursing homes in the United Kingdom. All homes received training in person-centered care, and were randomized to receive antipsychotic review, social interaction, and exercise, either alone or in combinations. Apathy was one of the secondary outcomes of the WHELD trial, and it was measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-nursing home version at baseline and 9\u00a0months (n\u00a0=\u00a0273). We used multilevel mixed effects linear regression models to assess the impact of the interventions on apathy.","Prevalence of apathy was 44.0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0120; 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.1%-49.9%) at baseline. Severity of apathy had significant positive correlations with dementia severity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, depressive symptoms, agitation, and the needs of the people with dementia (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Antipsychotic review reduced antipsychotic use, but it significantly increased apathy (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a05.37; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.91; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). However, antipsychotic review in combination with either social interaction (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-5.84; SE\u00a0=\u00a01.15; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) or exercise (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-7.54; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.93; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) significantly reduced apathy.","Antipsychotic review can play a significant role in improving apathy in people with dementia living in nursing homes, when combined with psychosocial interventions such as social interaction and exercise. Guidance must be adapted to reflect this subtlety in care."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2016 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

Cognitive decline for up to 5 years was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Survival analysis including Cox regression (time to reach severe dementia) and linear mixed-effects (lme) modelling were used to model the decline on MMSE.","At least one follow-up assessment was available for 67 patients with DLB and 107 patients with AD, with a median follow-up time of 4.3 years. The time to reach severe dementia was significantly shorter in DLB (median 1793 days) compared with AD (1947 days; p=0.033), and the difference remained significant in the multiple Cox regression analysis (HR=2.0, p<0.02).

with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), but are also frequently present in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Much remains unknown about the role of \u03b1-syn in the synapse and the wider role of synaptic dysfunction in these dementias. Changes in concentrations of key 'SNAP (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide Sensitive Factor Attachment Protein) Receptor' (SNARE) proteins as a consequence of alterations in the aggregation state of \u03b1-syn may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in patients with DLB, PDD, and AD and result in impaired cognition. We have studied a large cohort (n\u200a=\u200a130) of autopsy confirmed DLB, PDD, AD, and control brains. Using semi-quantitative western blotting, we have demonstrated significant changes across the diagnostic groups of DLB, PDD, and AD in the SNARE and vesicle proteins syntaxin, Munc18, VAMP2, and monomeric \u03b1-syn in the prefrontal cortex, with a significant reduction of Munc18 in AD patients (p\u200a< \u200a0.001). This correlated to the final MMSE score before death (p\u200a=\u200a0.016). We also identified a significant negative correlation between the duration of dementia and the levels of the binding partners VAMP2 (p\u200a=\u200a0.0004) and monomeric \u03b1-syn (p\u200a=\u200a0.0002). Our findings may indicate that an upregulation of SNARE complex related proteins occurs in the early stages of disease as an attempt at compensating for failing synapses, prior to widespread

Program.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"252-62"},"ELocationID":"10.1176\/appi.ajp.2015.15010130","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This study evaluated the impact of antipsychotic review, social interaction, and exercise, in conjunction with person-centered care, on antipsychotic use, agitation, and depression in people with dementia living in nursing homes.","A cluster-randomized factorial controlled trial with two replications was conducted in people with dementia in 16 U.K. nursing homes. All homes received training in person-centered care. Eight homes were randomly assigned to antipsychotic review, to a social interaction intervention, and to an exercise intervention for 9 months, with most homes assigned to more than one intervention. The primary outcome measures were antipsychotic use, agitation, and depression. Secondary outcome measures were overall neuropsychiatric symptoms and mortality.","Antipsychotic review significantly reduced antipsychotic use by 50% (odds ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05 to 0.60). Antipsychotic review plus the social interaction intervention significantly reduced mortality (odds ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.51) compared with the group receiving neither. The group receiving antipsychotic review but not the social intervention showed significantly worse outcome in neuropsychiatric symptoms compared with the group receiving neither (score difference +7.37, 95% CI 1.53 to 13.22). This detrimental impact was mitigated by concurrent delivery of the social intervention (-0.44, CI -4.39 to 3.52). The exercise intervention significantly improved neuropsychiatric symptoms (-3.59, 95% CI -7.08 to -0.09) but not depression (-1.21, CI -4.35 to 1.93). None of the interventions had a significant impact specifically on agitation.","While reductions in antipsychotic use can be achieved by using a \"real world\" intervention, this may not be of benefit to people with dementia in the current climate of more judicious prescribing unless nonpharmacological interventions such as social interaction or exercise are provided in parallel."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"From the Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London;

However, effective strategies for reducing the risk of developing these problems remain undefined. Potential strategies include intensive lowering of blood pressure (BP) and\/or lipids. This paper summarises the baseline characteristics, statistical analysis plan and feasibility of a randomised control trial of blood pressure and lipid lowering in patients post-stroke with the primary objective of reducing cognitive impairment and dementia.","The Prevention Of Decline in Cognition After Stroke Trial (PODCAST) was a multi-centre prospective randomised open-label blinded-endpoint controlled partial-factorial internal pilot trial running in secondary and primary care. Participants without dementia were enrolled 3-7 months post ischaemic stroke or spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and randomised to intensive versus guideline BP lowering (target systolic BP <125 mmHg versus <140 mmHg); patients with ischaemic stroke were also randomised to intensive or guideline lipid lowering (target LDL cholesterol <1.4 mmol\/L versus <3 mmol\/L). The primary outcome was the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised; a key secondary outcome was to assess feasibility of performing a large trial of one or both interventions. Data are number (%) or mean (standard deviation). The trial was planned to last for 8 years with follow-up between 1 and 8 years. The plan for reporting the main results is included as Additional file 2.","83 patients (of a planned 600) were recruited from 19 UK sites between 7 October 2010 and 31 January 2014. Delays, due to difficulties in the provision of excess treatment costs and to complexity of follow-up, led to few centres taking part and a much lower recruitment rate than planned. Patient characteristics at baseline were: age 74 (SD 7) years, male 64 (77 %), index stroke ischaemic 77 (93 %), stroke onset to randomisation 4.5 [SD 1.3] months, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised 86 (of 100, SD 8), Montreal Cognitive Assessment 24 (of 30, SD 3), BP 147\/82 (SD 19\/11) mmHg, total cholesterol 4.0 (SD 0.8) mmol\/L and LDL cholesterol 2.0 (SD 0.7) mmol\/L, modified Rankin Scale 1.1 (SD 0.8).","Limited recruitment suggests that a large trial is not feasible using the current protocol.

approach for dementia prevention and maintenance of cognitive function in older adults. Online delivery provides a cost-effective means of implementing CT compared with in-person interventions, with the potential of providing an effective public health intervention for risk reduction.","A double-blind 6-month online randomized controlled trial in adults older than 50 randomized to General CT, Reasoning CT, or control. The primary outcome was instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in adults older than 60. Secondary outcomes were reasoning, verbal short-term memory, spatial working memory, verbal learning (VL), and digit vigilance in adults older than 50. Secondary analyses were performed with a group defined as showing age-associated impairment in reasoning according to baseline scores in this domain.","A total of 2912 adults older than 60 (6742 > 50) participated. General and reasoning packages conferred benefit to IADL (P = .008, P = .011), reasoning (P < 0.0001, P < .0001), and VL (P = .007, P = .008) at 6 months. Benefit in reasoning was evident from 6 weeks. Other benefits developed over 6 months. Analysis of participants with age-associated impairment also showed the same pattern of benefit. A clear dose-response effect was seen.","Online CT confers significant benefit to cognition and function in older adults, with benefit favoring the Reasoning package. Scale of benefit is comparable with in-person training, indicating its potential as a public health intervention. Impact on the group with age-associated impairment indicates a particular sensitivity to this at-risk group, which merits further investigation."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

We investigated the effects of continuation or discontinuation of donepezil and starting of memantine on subsequent nursing home placement in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease.","In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Donepezil and Memantine in Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease (DOMINO-AD) trial, community-living patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (who had been prescribed donepezil continuously for at least 3 months at a dose of 10 mg for at least the previous 6 weeks and had a score of between 5 and 13 on the Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination) were recruited from 15 secondary care memory centres in England and Scotland and randomly allocated to continue donepezil 10 mg per day without memantine, discontinue donepezil without memantine, discontinue donepezil and start memantine 20 mg per day, or continue donepezil 10 mg per day and start memantine 20 mg per day, for 52 weeks. After 52 weeks, choice of treatment was left to participants and their physicians. Place of residence was recorded during the first 52 weeks of the trial and then every 26 weeks for a further 3 years. A secondary outcome of the trial, reported in this study, was nursing home placement: an irreversible move from independent accommodation to a residential caring facility. Analyses restricted to risk of placement in the first year of follow-up after the patients had completed the double-blind phase of the trial were post-hoc. The DOMINO-AD trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN49545035.","Between Feb 11, 2008, and March 5, 2010, 73 (25%) patients were randomly assigned to continue donepezil without memantine, 73 (25%) to discontinue donepezil without memantine, 76 (26%) to discontinue donepezil and start memantine, and 73 (25%) to continue donepezil and start memantine. 162 (55%) patients underwent nursing home placement within 4 years of randomisation, with similar numbers for all groups (36 [49%] in patients who continued donepezil without memantine, 42 [58%] who discontinued donepezil without memantine, 41 [54%] who discontinued donepezil and started memantine, and 43 [59%] who continued donepezil and started memantine). We noted significant (p=0\u00b7010) heterogeneity of treatment effect over time, with significantly more nursing home placements in the combined donepezil discontinuation groups during the first year (hazard ratio 2\u00b709 [95% CI 1\u00b729-3\u00b739]) than in the combined donepezil continuation groups, and no difference during the next 3 years (0\u00b789 [0\u00b758-1\u00b735]). We noted no effect of patients starting memantine compared with not starting memantine during the first year (0\u00b792 [0\u00b758-1\u00b745]) or the next 3 years (1\u00b723 [0\u00b781-1\u00b787]).","Withdrawal of donepezil in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease increased the risk of nursing home placement during 12 months of treatment, but made no difference during the following 3 years of follow-up. Decisions to stop or continue donepezil treatment should be informed by potential risks of withdrawal, even if the perceived benefits of continued treatment are not clear.","Medical Research Council and UK Alzheimer's Society."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

periods of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and it has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic target across a number of neurodegenerative conditions, but has not yet been studied in synuclein disorders.","The level of a key mediator of the UPR pathway, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), also known as binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), was measured in post mortem brain tissue of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) in comparison with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched controls using Western blot. The UPR activation was further confirmed by immunohistochemical detection of GRP78\/BiP and phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (p-PERK).","GRP78\/BiP was increased to a greater extent in DLB and PDD patients compared with AD and control subjects in cingulate gyrus and parietal cortex. However, there were no changes in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. There was a significant positive correlation between GRP78\/BiP level and \u03b1-synuclein pathology in the cingulate gyrus, while AD-type pathology showed an inverse correlation relationship in the parietal cortex.","Overall, these results give emphasis to the role of UPR in Lewy body dementias, and suggest that Lewy body degeneration, in combination with AD-type pathologies, is associated with increased UPR activation to a greater extent than AD alone, possibly as a consequence of the increasing load of ER proteins. This work also highlights a novel opportunity to explore the UPR as a therapeutic target in synuclein diseases."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2015 British Neuropathological

FITS (Focussed Intervention Training and Support) into Practice Programme. This intervention was scaled up from an earlier cluster randomised-controlled trial that had proven successful in significantly decreasing antipsychotic prescribing in care homes.","An in depth 10-day education course in person-centred care was delivered over a three-month period, followed by six supervision sessions. Participants were care-home staff designated as Dementia Care Coaches (DCCs) responsible for implementing interventions in 1 or 2 care homes. The course and supervision was provided by educators called Dementia Practice Development Coaches (DPDCs). Effectiveness data included monitoring antipsychotic prescriptions, goal attainment, knowledge, attitudes and implementation questionnaires. Qualitative data included case studies and reflective journals to elucidate issues of implementation.","Of the 100 DCCs recruited, 66 DCCs completed the programme. Pre-post questionnaires demonstrated increased knowledge and confidence and improved attitudes to dementia. Twenty per cent of residents were prescribed antipsychotics at baseline which reduced to 14% (31% reduction) with additional dose reductions being reported alongside improved personalised goal attainment. Crucial for FITS into Practice to succeed was the allocation and protection of time for the DCC to attend training and supervision and to carry out implementation tasks in addition to their existing job role. Evaluation data showed that this was a substantial barrier to implementation in a small number of homes.","The FITS into practice programme was well evaluated and resulted in reduction in inappropriate anti-psychotic prescribing. Revisions to the intervention are suggested to maximise successful implementation."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brooker","ForeName":"Dawn J","Initials":"DJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a

Pharmacological treatment options are limited to antipsychotics, which carry extensive safety issues. There is emerging evidence to support the potential benefits of memantine, currently licensed for moderate to severe AD, in the prophylaxis of neuropsychiatric symptoms.","The MAIN-AD study is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled withdrawal trial comparing memantine with antipsychotics for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms over 24 weeks. A total of 199 people with probable AD living in care homes already receiving an antipsychotic were randomized to receive either memantine or to continue an antipsychotic. The primary outcomes were function (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale [BADLS]) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]). Secondary outcomes were Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and mortality.","There was no significant difference between groups on the BADLS or CMAI. At 24 weeks, there was a nonsignificant adjusted difference in favor of memantine on the BADLS of 0.23 (95% CI -1.80-2.27; P = .82) and in favor of antipsychotic on the CMAI of 0.09 (95% CI -0.35-8.53; P = .07). Although there were no significant differences in total NPI, there were 5.01 (95% CI -1.68-11.70; P = .05) and 3.63 (95% CI -1.40-8.67; P = .16) point advantages favoring antipsychotics at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. In addition, in an exploratory analysis, individuals allocated to antipsychotics were significantly less likely to experience relapse of neuropsychiatric symptoms at all time points. The group receiving memantine had a nonsignificant 1.3-point advantage on the MMSE at 24 weeks.","This study indicates no benefits for memantine in the long-term treatment and prophylaxis of clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms.

We investigated the levels of ZnT3 and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), a marker of the postsynaptic terminal, in people with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD, n\u00a0= 31), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n\u00a0= 44), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n\u00a0= 16), and controls (n\u00a0= 24), using semiquantitative western blotting and immunohistochemistry in 3 cortical regions. Standardized cognitive assessments during life and semiquantitative scoring of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), tau, and \u03b1-synuclein at postmortem were used to investigate the relationship between ZnT3 and PSD95, cognition and pathology. Associations were observed between ZnT3 and PSD95 levels in prefrontal cortex and cognitive impairment (p\u00a0= 0.001 and p\u00a0= 0.002, respectively) and between ZnT3 levels in the parietal cortex and cognitive impairment (p\u00a0= 0.036). Associations were also seen between ZnT3 levels in cingulate cortex and severity of A\u03b2 (p\u00a0= 0.003) and tau (p\u00a0= 0.011) pathologies. DLB and PDD were characterized by significant reductions of PSD95 (p < 0.05) and ZnT3 (p < 0.001) in prefrontal cortex compared with controls and AD. PSD95 levels in the parietal cortex were found to be decreased in AD cases compared with controls (p\u00a0= 0.02) and PDD (p\u00a0= 0.005). This study has identified Zn(2+) modulation as a possible novel target for the treatment of cognitive impairment in DLB and PDD and the potential for synaptic proteins to be used as a biomarker for the differentiation of DLB and PDD from AD.

However, both dementias also show variable degrees of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), particularly in areas of the cortex associated with higher cognitive functions. This study investigates the contribution of the individual and combined pathologies in determining the rate of cognitive decline. Cortical \u03b1-synuclein, phosphorylated tau (phosphotau) and A\u03b2 plaque pathology in 34 PDD and 55 DLB patients was assessed semi-quantitatively in four regions of the neocortex. The decline in cognition, assessed by Mini Mental State Examination, correlated positively with the cortical \u03b1-synuclein load. Patients also had varying degrees of senile A\u03b2 plaque and phosphotau pathology. Regression analyses pointed to a combined pathology (A\u03b2 plaque plus phosphotau plus \u03b1-synuclein-positive features), particularly in the prefrontal cortex (BA9) and temporal lobe neocortex with the superior and middle temporal gyrus (BA21, 22), being a major determining factor in the development of dementia. Thus, cognitive decline in Lewy body dementias is not a consequence of \u03b1-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration alone but senile plaque and phosphorylated tau pathology also contribute to the overall deficits.

temporal lobe atrophy in older people with and without Alzheimer disease (AD).","A total of 368 memory clinic patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) were included. Depressive symptoms were defined as a score of 8 or higher on Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia or use of antidepressant medications. Magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography scans were rated for medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), using the Scheltens scale. For a subsample (n = 57 patients), hippocampal volume was manually traced.","Based on visual assessment, AD patients with depressive symptoms had less atrophy of the right medial temporal lobe (odds ratio [OR] for having MTA: 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.99) and decreased scores on Scheltens scale for the left medial temporal lobe (OR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.96) in comparison to AD patients without depressive symptoms. In the subgroup where manual tracing was used to measure hippocampal volume, people with SCI experiencing depressive symptoms had smaller right (mean difference: 0.28 cm(3); P = .005) and left (mean difference 0.32 cm(3); P = .002) hippocampal volumes compared to people with SCI who did not have depressive symptoms.","Hippocampal atrophy was more pronounced among patients having SCI with depressive symptoms, while the medial temporal lobe was less atrophic in patients having AD with depressive symptoms than those without depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that different mechanisms underlie depression in older people with and without AD and may explain some of the inconsistent observations in previous

people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and transgenic AD models have suggested that endogenous neurogenesis may be an important treatment target, but there is considerable discrepancy among studies. We examined endogenous neurogenesis and glia changes across the range of pathologic severity of AD in people with and without dementia to address this key question.","Endogenous neurogenesis and glia in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus neurogenic niches were evaluated using single and double immunohistochemistry and a validated antibody selection for stage-specific and type-specific markers in autopsy tissue from a representative cohort of 28 participants in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Immunopositive cells were measured blinded to diagnosis using bright-field and fluorescent microscopy.","The number of newly generated neurons significantly declined only in the dentate gyrus of patients with severe tau pathology. No other changes in other neurogenic markers were observed in either of the neurogenic niches. Alterations in astrocytes and microglia were also observed in the dentate gyrus across the different stages of tau pathology. No change in any of the markers was observed in individuals who died with dementia compared with individuals who did not die with dementia.","Alterations in endogenous neurogenesis appeared to be confined to a reduction in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of patients with AD and severe neurofibrillary tangle pathology and were accompanied by changes in the glia load.

It is important that this training is evidence based and delivers improvement for people with dementia residing in these environments. Well-being and Health for People with Dementia (WHELD) combines the most effective elements of existing approaches to develop a comprehensive but practical staff training intervention. This optimised intervention is based on a factorial study and qualitative evaluation, to combine: training on person-centred care, promoting person-centred activities and interactions, and providing care home staff and general practitioners with updated knowledge regarding the optimal use of psychotropic medications for persons with dementia in care homes.","The trial will be a randomised controlled two-arm cluster single blind trial that will take place for nine months across 80 care homes in the United Kingdom.","The overarching goal of this trial is to determine whether this optimised WHELD intervention is more effective in improving the quality of life and mental health than the usual care provided to people with dementia living in nursing homes.

of memantine, of whom long-term follow-up was available for 42. Treatment response was recorded 24\u2005weeks from baseline and measured by Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC). The participants were grouped as responders (CGIC 1-3) or non-responders (CGIC 4-7). The 24-week RCT was followed by open-label treatment and survival was recorded at 36\u2005months.","After 36-month follow-up, patients in the memantine group had a longer length of survival compared with patients in the placebo group (log rank x\u00b2=4.02, p=0.045). Within the active treatment group, survival analysis 36\u2005months from baseline showed that the memantine responders, based on CGIC, had higher rates of survival compared with the non-responders (log rank x\u00b2=6.595, p=0.010). Similar results were not seen in the placebo group.","Early treatment with memantine and a positive clinical response to memantine predicted longer survival in patients with DLB and PDD. This suggests a possible disease-modifying effect and also has implications for health economic analysis. However, owing to the small study sample, our results should merely be considered as generating a hypothesis which needs to be evaluated in larger studies.","ISRCTN89624516."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Cerebral zinc has been implicated in depression and synaptic dysfunction. We investigated the relationship between synaptic zinc regulation (for which zinc transporter 3 [ZnT3] is responsible) and depression in a large clinicopathologic study.","We examined brains from people with PDD (N\u00a0= 29), DLB (N\u00a0= 27), and AD (N\u00a0= 15) and comparison subjects without depression or dementia (N\u00a0= 24). Individuals were categorized according to the presence and severity of depression (on a scale of 0-3) based on standardized assessments during life (principally Neuropsychiatric Inventory). Western blotting was used to determine ZnT3 levels in Brodmann area 9 (BA9), and regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between ZnT3 and depression.","Reductions in ZnT3 in BA9 were significantly associated with elevated depression scores in the study cohort (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.351, df\u00a0= 93, t\u00a0=\u00a0-3.318 p\u00a0= 0.0004). This association remained when only individuals with DLB, PDD, and no dementia or depression were examined (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.347, df\u00a0= 78, t\u00a0=\u00a0-3.271, p\u00a0= 0.002) or only individuals with AD and no dementia or depression were examined (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.433, df\u00a0= 37, t\u00a0=\u00a0-2.924, p\u00a0= 0.006).","Although decreased zinc levels have been implicated in the genesis of depression in animal models and in major depressive disorder in humans, this study provides the first evidence of a role for zinc in depression in people with dementia and highlights zinc metabolism as a therapeutic target."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

Dynamin1 is a 100 kDa protein, accounting for 0.4% of the total brain protein, and has a central role in many intracellular processes such as synaptic vesicle trafficking and recycling. In this study, we examined the status of Dynamin1 in the white matter from frontal cortex area. In order to measure the levels of Dynamin1, we isolated cortical white matter from a total of 34 post-mortem brains derived from controls (N=11), mixed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and VaD (N=8), VaD (N=7), and stroke no dementia (SND, N=8) subjects. A commercial ELISA kit was then used to determine the level of Dynamin1. In comparison to controls, Dynamin1 was elevated in patients SND (+400%) and reduced in patients with mixed VaD (-50%). Furthermore, levels of Dynamin1 were significantly associated with preserved cognition as indicated by the MMSE and CAMCOG and upregulation of vesicular glutamate transporter 1.

in the gene encoding mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) has been associated with Alzheimer's disease, with the A allele being recognised as a risk factor, but has not been studied in other types of dementia. We hypothesised that TFAM SNP rs2306604 might also be associated with Lewy body dementias. To test this hypothesis rs2306604 genotype was determined in 141 controls and 135 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). rs2306604 genotype frequencies were significantly different to controls in PDD (p=0.042), but not in DLB (p=0.529). The A allele was also associated with PDD (p=0.024, OR=2.092), but not DLB (p=0.429, OR=1.308). Moreover, the A allele was strongly associated with PDD in males (p=0.001, OR=5.570), but not in females (p=0.832, OR=1.100). Mitochondrial DNA copy number in the prefrontal cortex was also significantly reduced in PDD patients, but this reduction was not associated with rs2306604 genotype. These data show that the TFAM SNP rs2306604 A allele may be a risk factor for PDD, particularly in males, but not for DLB. Therefore, the genetic factors that predispose individuals to develop dementia may differ in PDD and DLB.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

At present, it is unclear whether the glutamatergic system is affected in these disorders. In this study, we measured \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor GluA subunits in the postmortem neocortex of a cohort of prospectively studied Lewy body dementia cases, as well as age-matched controls by immunoblotting. We found losses of GluA2\/3\/4 immunoreactivities in Lewy body dementias which correlated with higher pre-death Hoehn and Yahr scores and with longer Parkinson's disease duration before dementia onset, but not with dementia severity, cortical Lewy body burden, or amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden.

Although they result in symptoms common to Alzheimer's disease, they are associated with early emergence of parkinsonism and high frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms, most commonly hallucinations and delusions. This review summarizes the current understanding of the underlying biology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB and PDD and the evidence base for treatment to address them. Disruption to cholinergic and serotonergic neurotransmission and synapse activity are highlighted as primary pathological factors in neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly loss of key neurotransmitter functions, alterations to neuronal receptors in the serotonergic pathway, and regionally specific structural changes that are linked to specific symptoms. Review of options for pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms suggests that the best evidence for the value of treatment is for cholinesterase inhibitors, with an indication that people with visual hallucinations are particularly likely to benefit. Evidence for the benefits of antipsychotics other than clozapine is limited, and there are serious safety concerns about the use of antipsychotics in these patients. Evidence to support other pharmacological interventions is very preliminary. Nonpharmacological approaches based on person-centered care and cholinesterase inhibitors should be considered as the first-line treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms except in extreme cases.

therapies in the prodromal (early, pre-dementia), asymptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. Diagnostic biomarker tests offer a means of identifying prodromal patients, but it is unclear how potential participants feel about their use. Deciding whether to take part in a clinical trial is a complex process in which eligible participants must balance risks and discomforts against uncertain benefits. We sought to explore the views of potential participants through qualitative research methods.","Focus groups with people with early memory problems, current and former family carers explored attitudes towards participating in clinical trials in the prodromal stages of the disease, using an example of anti-amyloid antibody-therapy (immunotherapy), which are currently in development.","Despite the complexities involved, almost all participants had a clear idea about whether they, personally, would like to take part. Many were highly motivated to obtain an unambiguous diagnosis, regardless of their desire to participate in a clinical trial. Participants expressed minimal concern regarding the risk of adverse events associated with immunotherapy, whereas certain tests and trial procedures provoked greater anxiety. People with memory problems were found to assess the study demands in relation to their own priorities and circumstances.","The priorities of patients might be different to clinicians and those who design and regulate clinical trials. Patient views can be used to inform the ethical debate around the disclosure of biomarker status, the design of clinical trials and the content of trial information."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lawrence","ForeName":"Vanessa","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pickett","ForeName":"James","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murray","ForeName":"Joanna","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0608-10133","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2013","Month":"05","Day":"06"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"ErratumIn"},"RefSource":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2014 Dec;29(12):1318"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Trials as Topic","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Dysfunction","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Immunotherapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Participation","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Prodromal Symptoms"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer's Disease","Mild Cognitive Impairment","engagement in research trials","immunotherapy","patients","qualitative research"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2012","Month":"09","Day":"02"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2013","Month":"02","Day":"27"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"6","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23649902","10.1002\/gps.3958"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23611363","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1545-7214","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"The response of agitated behavior to pain management in persons with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"708-17"},"ELocationID":["10.1016\/j.jagp.2012.12.006","S1064-7481(12)00103-0"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Behavioral disturbances and pain are common in nursing home (NH) patients with dementia.

We tested for association with loci previously associated with Alzheimer's disease risk and, despite the small size of the study, we detected associations with age at onset of Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome with PICALM (\u03b2\u00a0= 3.31, p\u00a0= 0.011) and the APOE loci (\u03b2\u00a0= 3.58, p\u00a0= 0.014).

This has been known since Dr. Alois Alzheimer's first case, Frau Auguste D., presented with emotional distress and delusions of infidelity\/excessive jealousy, followed by cognitive symptoms. Being cognizant of this, in 2010 the Alzheimer's Association convened a research roundtable on the topic of NPS in AD. A major outcome of the roundtable was the founding of a Professional Interest Area (PIA) within the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). The NPS-PIA has prepared a series of documents that are intended to summarize the literature and provide more detailed specific recommendations for NPS research. This overview paper is the first of these living documents that will be updated periodically as the science advances. The overview is followed by syndrome-specific synthetic reviews and recommendations prepared by NPS-PIA workgroups on depression, apathy, sleep, agitation, and psychosis.

and other dementias. They are distressing for the individual and often confer risk to them and to others, as well as raising significant clinical challenges. This review outlines the current evidence for pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to the treatment of agitation and aggression in these patients.","There is a growing body of literature supporting the use of nonpharmacological approaches as well as the treatment of pain as a first-line management strategy prior to psychopharmacotherapy. Antipsychotic medications are most commonly prescribed to address agitation and aggression. Evidence indicates this approach results in a modest but significant improvement in aggression in the short term (6-12 weeks) although the impact on other symptoms of agitation is limited. There is less positive evidence to support their use in the longer term, and prescriptions of more than 12 weeks and longer periods of prescription are associated with cumulative risk of severe adverse events, including death. Suggested pharmacological alternatives with the most promising preliminary evidence include memantine, carbamazepine, citalopram, and prazosin, but none of these agents have sufficient evidence in treating agitation and aggression to recommend use in routine clinical practice.","Currently, the best approach for managing these symptoms is within a framework of good practice that promotes prevention, monitoring and the use of nonpharmacological alternatives, with judicious short-term use of antipsychotics, when appropriate."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age Related Diseases, Guy's Campus, King's College London, London, UK. clive.ballard@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corbett","ForeName":"Anne","Initials":"A"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Curr Opin Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8809880","ISSNLinking":"0951-7367"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antidepressive Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Curr Opin Psychiatry. 2013 May;26(3):237-8","PMID":"23493132"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aggression","QualifierName":["drug effects","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Antidepressive Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Evidence-Based Medicine"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychomotor Agitation","QualifierName":["etiology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy","QualifierName":"methods"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"3","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"3","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"9","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23528917","10.1097\/YCO.0b013e32835f414b","00001504-201305000-00005"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23392273","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"10","Day":"29"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"35","Issue":"3-4","PubDate":{"Year":"2013"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"Cognitive impairment in studies of 5HTTLPR and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"155-64"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000346733","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Cognitive impairment is a well-established correlate of psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD-P).

In the UK dementia care is a national priority with a vast impact on services. WHELD combines the most effective elements of existing approaches to develop a comprehensive but practical intervention. This will be achieved by training care staff to provide care that is focused on an understanding of the individual and their needs; and by using additional components such as exercise, activities and social interaction to improve mental health and quality of life (QoL) and reduce the use of sedative drugs.","Work Package 3 (WP3) is the pilot randomised trial and qualitative evaluation to help develop a future definitive randomised controlled clinical trial. The study design is a cluster randomised 2x2x2 factorial design with two replications in 16 care homes. Each care home is randomized to receive one of the eight possible permutations of the four key interventions, with each possible combination delivered in two of the 16 homes. Each cluster includes a minimum of 12 participants (depending upon size of the care home, the number of people with dementia and the number consenting).","The overarching goal of the programme is to provide an effective, simple and practical intervention which improves the mental health of, and reduces sedative drug use in, people with dementia in care homes and which can be implemented

There are very few data on the cost-effectiveness of antidepressants for depression in dementia and their effects on carer outcomes.","To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sertraline and mirtazapine compared with placebo for depression in dementia.","A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial with a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis (trial registration: ISRCTN88882979 and EudraCT 2006-000105-38). The primary cost-effectiveness analysis compared differences in treatment costs for patients receiving sertraline, mirtazapine or placebo with differences in effectiveness measured by the primary outcome, total Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) score, over two time periods: 0-13 weeks and 0-39 weeks. The secondary evaluation was a cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) computed from the Euro-Qual (EQ-5D) and societal weights over those same periods.","There were 339 participants randomised and 326 with costs data (111 placebo, 107 sertraline, 108 mirtazapine). For the primary outcome, decrease in depression, mirtazapine and sertraline were not cost-effective compared with placebo. However, examining secondary outcomes, the time spent by unpaid carers caring for participants in the mirtazapine group was almost half that for patients receiving placebo (6.74 v. 12.27 hours per week) or sertraline (6.74 v. 12.32 hours per week). Informal care costs over 39 weeks were \u00a31510 and \u00a31522 less for the mirtazapine group compared with placebo and sertraline respectively.","In terms of reducing depression, mirtazapine and sertraline were not cost-effective for treating depression in dementia. However, mirtazapine does appear likely to have been cost-effective if costing includes the impact on unpaid carers and with quality of life included in the outcome. Unpaid (family) carer costs were lower with mirtazapine than sertraline or placebo. This may have been mediated via the putative ability of mirtazapine to ameliorate sleep disturbances and anxiety. Given the priority and the potential value of supporting family carers of people with dementia, further research is warranted to investigate the potential of mirtazapine to help with behavioural and

Given the recent failures of various novel disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials, a complementary strategy based on repositioning drugs that are approved for other indications could be attractive. Indeed, a substantial body of preclinical work indicates that several classes of such drugs have potentially beneficial effects on Alzheimer's-like brain pathology, and for some drugs the evidence is also supported by epidemiological data or preliminary clinical trials. Here, we present a formal consensus evaluation of these opportunities, based on a systematic review of published literature.

in people with dementia, but it is unclear how to maximise their effectiveness or acceptability in residential settings.","To understand what underlies the successful implementation of psychosocial interventions in care homes.","Systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative research.","The synthesis of 39 qualitative papers revealed that beneficial psychosocial interventions met the needs of people with dementia to connect with others, make a meaningful contribution and reminisce. Successful implementation rested on the active engagement of staff and family and the continuing provision of tailored interventions and support. This necessitated staff time, and raised issues around priorities and risk, but ultimately helped redefine staff attitudes towards residents and the caregiving role.","The findings from the meta-synthesis can help to inform the development and evaluation of psychosocial interventions in care homes and support their widespread implementation in clinical settings."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lawrence","ForeName":"Vanessa","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fossey","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moniz-Cook","ForeName":"Esme","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Murray","ForeName":"Joanna","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0608-10133","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Meta-Analysis","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Br J Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"0342367","ISSNLinking":"0007-1250"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":[{"@attributes":{"RefType":"ErratumIn"},"RefSource":"Br J Psychiatry. 2013 Jul;203(1):75"},{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Br J Psychiatry. 2012 Nov;201(5):342-3","PMID":"23118033"}]},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Institutionalization","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Personnel Staffing and Scheduling"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"4","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23118034","S0007125000272796","10.1192\/bjp.bp.111.101402"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23093329","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"07","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1759-4766","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"8","Issue":"12","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"Nature reviews.

All participants with dementia underwent serial evaluation of neuropsychiatric symptoms to assess the presence of persistent delusions and hallucinations using the Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer's disease, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Present Behavioural Examination. Severity of cognitive impairment was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Both controls and participants with dementia were genotyped for rs4680. In contrast to previous findings, analysis by logistic regression failed to find any associations between rs4680 and psychotic symptoms.

Seven hundred and one AD patients with at least 3 different cognitive evaluations and genotypic information for APOE and 6 genome wide association study-significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were selected for this study. Mean differences in Global Deterioration Score and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were evaluated using nonparametric tests, general linear model and mixed models for repeated measurements. Each chart was also reviewed for evidence of treatment with any cholinesterase inhibitor, memantine, or both. Relationships between therapeutic protocols, genetic markers, and progression were explored using stratified analysis looking for specific effects on progression in each therapeutic category separately. Neither calculation rendered a Bonferroni-corrected statistically significant difference in any genetic marker. Mixed model results suggested differences in the average point in MMSE test for patients carrying PICALM GA or AA genotype compared with GG carriers at the end of the follow-up (MMSE mean difference = -0.57; 95% confidence interval, -1.145 to 0.009; p = 0.047). This observation remained unaltered after covariate adjustments although it did not achieve predefined multiple testing significance threshold. The PICALM single-nucleotide polymorphism also displayed a significant effect protecting against rapid progression during pharmacogenetic assays although its observed effect displayed heterogeneity among AD therapeutic protocols (p = 0.039). None of the studied genetic markers were convincingly linked to AD progression or drug response. However, by using different statistical approaches, the PICALM rs3851179 marker displayed consistent but weak effects on disease progression phenotypes.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

progression in Lewy body dementia (LBD). The effects of proteasome inhibition using lactacystin and epoxomicin in primary neuronal culture were studied to assess the validity of this model to reflect the cortical pathology of LBD. Treatment of primary cortical neurons with 5 \u03bcM lactacystin for 24 h led to a 38 % reduction in the levels of \u03b2-III-tubulin (p < 0.05), a 48 % reduction in the levels of synaptophysin (p < 0.05) and a 74 % reduction in the levels of drebrin (p < 0.01), when compared to controls. Results for epoxomicin were similar. The loss of neuronal protein occurred prior to any loss of mitochondrial activity or cell death. The results are reflective of the loss of synapses and the synaptic changes observed in LBD, which may be an early event in the neurodegeneration of LBD. The similarities with the pathological changes in LBD highlight the possibility that this model can potentially provide a platform to test novel

life-quality and carer distress. The best evidence-based pharmacological treatments are antipsychotics which have limited benefits with increased morbidity and mortality. There are no memantine trials in clinically significant agitation but post-hoc analyses in other populations found reduced agitation. We tested the primary hypothesis, memantine is superior to placebo for clinically significant agitation, in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.","We recruited 153 participants with AD and clinically significant agitation from care-homes or hospitals for a double-blind randomised-controlled trial and 149 people started the trial of memantine versus placebo. The primary outcome was 6 weeks mixed model autoregressive analysis of Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Secondary outcomes were: 12 weeks CMAI; 6 and 12 weeks Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI), Clinical Global Impression Change (CGI-C), Standardised Mini Mental State Examination, Severe Impairment Battery. Using a mixed effects model we found no significant differences in the primary outcome, 6 weeks CMAI, between memantine and placebo (memantine lower -3.0; -8.3 to 2.2, p\u200a=\u200a0.26); or 12 weeks CMAI; or CGI-C or adverse events at 6 or 12 weeks. NPI mean difference favoured memantine at weeks 6 (-6.9; -12.2 to -1.6; p\u200a=\u200a0.012) and 12 (-9.6; -15.0 to -4.3 p\u200a=\u200a0.0005). Memantine was significantly better than placebo for cognition. The main study limitation is that it still remains to be determined whether memantine has a role in milder agitation in AD.","Memantine did not improve significant agitation in people with in moderate-to-severe AD. Future studies are urgently needed to test other pharmacological candidates in this group and memantine for neuropsychiatric symptoms.","ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00371059.","International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial 24953404."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fox","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.

This review highlights current treatment options for AD and the main focusses of therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials and for future therapeutic development. Existing treatments slow the progression of symptoms of the disease, but their efficacy does not extend to all people with AD, and benefits are not conveyed beyond an average of 6 months. Despite the substantial economic cost and healthcare burden of AD, which is increasing as populations age, there are currently only three therapies being investigated in Phase III clinical trials.

In Alzheimer's disease (AD) both increased and decreased neurogenesis has been reported and cholinergic activity is assumed to be involved in neurogenesis. The aim of this study was to systematically assess different phases of neurogenesis and their relation to AD and cholinergic pathology. We investigated post-mortem brain tissue from 20 AD patients and 21 non-demented controls that was neuropathologically characterized according to standardized criteria. Hippocampal sections were stained with antibodies against neurogenic markers Musashi-1, nestin, PSA-NCAM, doublecortin, and \u03b2-III-tubulin as well as ChAT (choline-acetyltransferase). Using image analysis immunoreactivity was assessed in the subventricular zone, the sub-granular layer, and the granule cell layer by determining the integrated optical density. In the sub-granular layer and the granule cell layer Musashi-1 and ChAT immunoreactivities were significantly lower in AD and decreased with increasing Braak stages. Conversely, immunorreactivities of both nestin and PSA-NCAM were significantly higher in AD and increased with increasing Braak stages while no changes were seen for doublecortin and \u03b2-III-tubulin, except for significantly higher doublecortin levels in the granule cell layer of AD cases. Of note, Musashi-1 immunoreactivity significantly correlated with ChAT immuonoreactivity across different Braak stages. In the subventricular zone only nestin immunoreactivity was significantly higher in AD and significantly increased with increasing Braak stages, while no significant differences were seen for all other markers. Our finding of a reduction of ChAT and Musashi-1 levels in AD is compatible with the assumption that cholinergic pathology per se has a detrimental influence on neurogenesis. We conclude that neurogenic abnormalities in AD differ between phases and areas of neurogenesis and stages of AD; while hippocampal stem cells (Musashi-1) decrease, proliferation (nestin) increases and differentiation\/migration phase as well as axonal\/dendritic targeting (doublecortin and \u03b2-III-tubulin) remains virtually unchanged. This suggests an attenuation of stem cells together with compensatory increased proliferation that, however, does not result in an increased number of migratory neuroblasts and differentiated neurons in AD.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Pain is also frequent in people with dementia, particularly those with severe disease. As no robust clinical guidelines are available for the treatment of pain in the context of dementia, the risk of inadequate treatment in individuals with this condition is high. Furthermore, our understanding of the aetiology of pain and the potential role of dementia-associated neuropathology in pain is limited. These issues are important in the clinical management of individuals with dementia, as untreated pain is a major contributor to reduced quality of life and disability, and can lead to increased behavioural and psychological symptoms. Assessment scales to identify pain in people with dementia have been highlighted in recent studies, but there is little evidence for consistency between these tools. Numerous studies have evaluated various approaches for the treatment of pain, including stepped-care protocols and\/or administration of paracetamol and opioid medications. In this Review, we summarize the best-available evidence regarding the aetiology, assessment and treatment of pain in people with dementia. Further validation of assessment tools and large-scale trials of treatment approaches in people with dementia are needed to improve clinical guidance for the treatment of pain in these individuals."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corbett","ForeName":"Anne","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's

clinical challenge. Dementia is also associated with a substantial economic cost and burden to health service provision. Existing treatments slow the progression of symptoms of the disease, but their efficacy does not extend to all patients and is not sustained beyond an average of 6 months. It is, therefore, critical to address the current lack of effective treatments to target the underlying pathology and disease process in Alzheimer's disease.","This review aims to highlight the main areas of new therapeutic development and discuss some of the main therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Despite a number of promising rationales for therapeutic treatments in Alzheimer's disease, very few of these avenues have been developed beyond preclinical studies. The predominant focus of the current article is on treatments currently in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, but some other promising areas of development are also discussed. There are currently only three therapeutics being investigated in Phase III clinical trials. This emphasizes the substantial caution and underinvestment in treatment development in this area.","There is a distinct lack of novel approaches in the pipeline, and whether there is a new disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease in the next 5 years almost entirely depends on the success of currently ongoing immunotherapy studies.

It is not known whether treatment benefits continue after the progression to moderate-to-severe disease.","We assigned 295 community-dwelling patients who had been treated with donepezil for at least 3 months and who had moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (a score of 5 to 13 on the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination [SMMSE, on which scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function]) to continue donepezil, discontinue donepezil, discontinue donepezil and start memantine, or continue donepezil and start memantine.

The coprimary outcomes were scores on the SMMSE and on the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS, on which scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater impairment). The minimum clinically important differences were 1.4 points on the SMMSE and 3.5 points on the BADLS.","Patients assigned to continue donepezil, as compared with those assigned to discontinue donepezil, had a score on the SMMSE that was higher by an average of 1.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.5) and a score on the BADLS that was lower (indicating less impairment) by 3.0 points (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.3) (P<0.001 for both comparisons).

Evidence to support treatment with Alzheimer's drugs is inadequate, although memantine is beneficial in transgenic mice. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of memantine on cognition and function in individuals with Down's syndrome.","In our prospective randomised double-blind trial, we enrolled adults (>40 years) with karyotypic or clinically diagnosed Down's syndrome, with and without dementia, at four learning disability centres in the UK and Norway. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive memantine or placebo for 52 weeks by use of a computer-generated sequence and a minimisation algorithm to ensure balanced allocation for five prognostic factors (sex, dementia, age group, total Down's syndrome attention, memory, and executive function scales [DAMES] score, and centre). The primary outcome was change in cognition and function, measured with DAMES scores and the adaptive behaviour scale (ABS) parts I and II.

Key treatment targets include cognitive and functional impairments, neuropsychiatric symptoms including intense and persistent visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Six-month, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine have indicated modest but significant benefits in cognition, function, global outcome and neuropsychiatric symptoms in both PDD and DLB. The evidence base for other cholinesterase inhibitors from RCTs is inconclusive. More recent RCTs with memantine in PDD\/DLB patients indicate a benefit with regard to global outcome, with some suggestion of a specific benefit with respect to sleep disturbance. Given the risk of severe antipsychotic sensitivity reactions, antipsychotics should be avoided. A significant proportion of PDD\/DLB patients are responsive to levodopa, but care needs to be taken with anti-parkinsonian treatments because of their potential propensity to exacerbate

Dementia has been highlighted as a major priority for health care and research because of the enormous economical and health burden associated with it. Consultations with people with dementia and carers have highlighted that timely well-targeted information services are a key priority for enabling them to 'live well with dementia'. Despite this, the evidence base for the optimal design and delivery of an information provision service is limited. Findings from randomised controlled trials and other studies have indicated that information provision does confer some benefit in carer outcomes and in the symptoms and well-being of people with dementia. However, there is limited understanding of the optimal design of such a service because of the variety of approaches that have been evaluated, the wide range of settings and locations and the lack of a clear conceptual framework. The existing evidence base supports the importance of an optimised information provision service and strongly indicates the need for a large-scale RCT to identify the most effective and cost-effective design for people with dementia and their carers.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Corbett","ForeName":"Anne","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Society (Research), London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Older People Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"101267281","ISSNLinking":"1748-3735"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["surgery","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Education","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Information Dissemination","QualifierName":"methods"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"1","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21884487","10.1111\/j.1748-3743.2011.00289.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21765198","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1756-1833","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"343","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Jul","Day":"15"}},"Title":"BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ"},"ArticleTitle":"Efficacy of treating pain to reduce behavioural disturbances in residents of nursing homes with dementia: cluster randomised clinical trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"d4065"},"ELocationID":["10.1136\/bmj.d4065","bmj.d4065"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To determine whether a systematic approach to the treatment of pain can reduce agitation in people with moderate to severe dementia living in nursing homes.","Cluster randomised controlled trial.","60 clusters (single independent nursing home units) in 18 nursing homes within five municipalities of western Norway.","352 residents with moderate to severe dementia and clinically significant behavioural disturbances randomised to a stepwise protocol for the treatment of pain for eight weeks with additional follow-up four weeks after the end of treatment (33 clusters; n = 175) or to usual treatment (control, 27 clusters; n = 177).","Participants in the intervention group received individual daily treatment of pain for eight weeks according to the stepwise protocol, with paracetamol (acetaminophen), morphine, buprenorphine transdermal patch, or pregabaline.

Participants were ineligible if they were clinically critical (eg, suicide risk), contraindicated to study drugs, on antidepressants, in another trial, or had no carer. The clinical trials unit at King's College London (UK) randomly allocated participants with a computer-generated block randomisation sequence, stratified by centre, with varying block sizes, in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive sertraline (target dose 150 mg per day), mirtazapine (45 mg), or placebo (control group), all with standard care.

diseases that are characterized by intra-neuronal inclusions of Lewy bodies in distinct brain regions. These inclusions consist mainly of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein. The present study used immunoprecipitation combined with nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to high resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS\/MS) to determine known and novel isoforms of \u03b1-syn in brain tissue homogenates. N-terminally acetylated full-length \u03b1-syn (Ac-\u03b1-syn\u2081\u208b\u2081\u2084\u2080) and two N-terminally acetylated C-terminally truncated forms of \u03b1-syn (Ac-\u03b1-syn\u2081\u208b\u2081\u2083\u2089 and Ac-\u03b1-syn\u2081\u208b\u2081\u2080\u2083) were found. The different forms of \u03b1-syn were further studied by Western blotting in brain tissue homogenates from the temporal cortex Brodmann area 36 (BA36) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex BA9 derived from controls, patients with DLB and PD with dementia (PDD). Quantification of \u03b1-syn in each brain tissue fraction was performed using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ohrfelt","ForeName":"Annika","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease. Thus, Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Although there are licensed treatments that can alleviate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of pathogenesis to enable development of disease-modifying treatments. Methods for improving diagnosis are also moving forward, but a better consensus is needed for development of a panel of biological and neuroimaging biomarkers that support clinical diagnosis. There is now strong evidence of potential risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and cognitive decline, but further work is needed to understand these better and to establish whether interventions can substantially lower these risks. In this Seminar, we provide an overview of recent evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and discuss potential ways to reduce the risk of developing the disease.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Antipsychotics have been widely used as a first-line treatment, resulting in an estimated 1,800 excess strokes and 1,600 excess deaths in the UK alone. Safe and effective alternatives are urgently needed. Based upon preliminary evidence from clinical trials, aromatherapy with melissa oil may be such an alternative, but initial studies have been modest in size, and adequate blinding has been problematic. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of melissa aromatherapy in the treatment of agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease in an adequately powered and robustly blinded randomized controlled trial comparing it with donepezil, an anticholinesterase drug used with some benefit to treat BPSD.","The study was a double-blind parallel-group placebo-controlled randomized trial across 3 specialist old age psychiatry centres in England. Participants had probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, were resident in a care home, had clinically significant agitation (defined as a score of 39 or above on the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory) and were free of antipsychotics and\/or anticholinesterase for at least 2 weeks. Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 groups: placebo medication and active aromatherapy; active medication and placebo aromatherapy or placebo of both.","The primary outcome measure was reduction in agitation as assessed by the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale (PAS) at 4 weeks. This is an observational scale, and raters were required to wear nose clips to ensure that full blinding was maintained. The PAS, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; another measure of BPSD) and other outcome measures were completed at baseline, 4-week and 12-week follow-ups. 114 participants were randomized, of whom 94 completed the week 4 assessment and 81 completed the week 12 assessment. Aromatherapy and donepezil were well tolerated. There were no significant differences between aromatherapy, donepezil and placebo at week 4 and week 12, but importantly there were substantial improvements in all 3 groups with an 18% improvement in the PAS and a 37% improvement in the NPI over 12 weeks.","When assessed using a rigorous design which ensures blinding of treatment arms, there is no evidence that melissa aromatherapy is superior to placebo or donepezil, in the treatment of agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease. However, the sizeable improvement in the placebo group emphasizes the potential non-specific benefits of touch and interaction in the treatment of agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 S.

CSF levels of A\u03b238, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 were determined using commercially available ultra-sensitive multi-array kit assay (MSD) for human A\u03b2 peptides. Total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) were analysed using ELISA (Innotest). In addition, combinations (A\u03b242\/A\u03b238, A\u03b242\/A\u03b240, A\u03b242\/P-tau and A\u03b242\/A\u03b238\/P-tau) were assessed.","Significant between group differences were found for all CSF measures, and all except A\u03b240, A\u03b242 and A\u03b242\/P-tau differed between AD and DLB. The A\u03b242\/A\u03b238 ratio was the measure that best discriminated between AD and DLB (AUC 0.765; p<0.005), with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 67%.","This study suggests that the level of A\u03b238 can potentially contribute in the diagnostic distinction between AD and DLB when combined with A\u03b242.

on the sMMSE, BADLS and NPI in the first 127 participants to complete DOMINO yielded MCIDs of 1.4 points for sMMSE, 3.5 for BADLS and 8.0 for NPI.","Reference to MCIDs is important for the full interpretation of the results of dementia trials and those conducting such trials should be open about the way in which they have determined and chosen their values for the MCIDs."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons,

dementia and present a major treatment challenge for clinicians. Most good practice guidelines suggest non-pharmacological treatments as the first-line therapy and there is emerging evidence, including randomized controlled trials, that a variety of psychological and training interventions, including social interaction and person-centred care training, are effective. There is evidence from meta-analyses that some atypical antipsychotic drugs, specifically risperidone and aripiprazole, confer benefit in the treatment of aggression in people with Alzheimer's disease over a period of up to 12 weeks. However, these benefits have to be considered in the context of significant adverse events, including extrapyramidal symptoms, accelerated cognitive decline, stroke and death. In addition, the limited evidence available does not indicate ongoing treatment benefits over longer periods of therapy. The evidence is limited for other pharmacological treatment approaches, but the best evidence is probably for carbamazepine, memantine and citalopram. There is very limited evidence for any therapies in non-Alzheimer dementias. In conclusion, it is important in most situations to limit the use of antipsychotic medication to short-term treatment (up to 12 weeks) of severe neuropsychiatric symptoms to limit harm. Non-pharmacological therapies offer a viable and effective alternative in many situations. Adequately powered randomized controlled trials for the treatment of clinically significant agitation are urgently needed to explore alternative pharmacological therapies."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson

the elderly. It is unclear which genes influence risk of delayed dementia after stroke. We tested a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene at codon 298 (single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1799983; p.Asp298Glu) in a cohort of 355 older (>75 years) stroke survivors, who had detailed cognitive assessments from 3 months poststroke, i.e., baseline when the patients were free of dementia and subsequently at annual intervals. Of these, 253 participants were genotyped for polymorphisms in NOS3 and apolipoprotein E (APOE). Our analysis showed that homozygosity for NOS3 TT rather than the GT or GG genotype was a significant factor in the development of dementia. The presence of TT genotype increased risk of incident dementia compared with GG genotype; hazard ratio, 3.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.64-5.99; p = 0.001). We hypothesize that this may be mediated by reduction of nitric oxide production and cerebral perfusion. Our findings, if replicated widely, have implications for treatments to ameliorate cognitive decline in stroke survivors.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Substantial advances in clinical criteria and neuroimaging technology over the last 20 years have allowed great strides in the detection and differential diagnosis of these disorders. Nevertheless, it is clear that whilst the array of different imaging modalities in clinical use allow for a robust diagnosis of \u03b1-synucleinopathy in comparison to healthy subjects, there is no clear diagnostic imaging marker that affords a reliable differential diagnosis between the different forms of Lewy body disease (LBD) or that could facilitate tracking of disease progression. This has led to a call for a biomarker based on the pathological hallmarks of these diseases, namely \u03b1-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies (LBs). This potentially may be advantageous in terms of early disease detection, but may also be leveraged into a potential marker of disease progression. We here aim to firstly review the current status of neuroimaging biomarkers in PD and related synucleinopathies. Secondly, we outline the rationale behind \u03b1-synuclein imaging as a potential novel biomarker as well as the potential benefits and limitations of this approach.

To evaluate changes in neural stem cells and progenitors in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the neural stem cell markers Musashi 1, nestin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), doublecortin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were examined in age-matched control and DLB groups. Staining was quantified in the hippocampal SVZ, subgranular layer (SGL) and ependymal cell layer (EPL). There was a significant loss in DLB of Musashi 1 (P < 0.01) in all areas, an increase in PCNA in hippocampal SVZ (P = 0.01) and SGL (P = 0.05), and an increase in doublecortin in the hippocampal SVZ (P = 0.04) and EPL (P = 0.02).

An immunohistological study was performed in order to examine neurogenesis in both the subventricular and peri-infarct zones of vascular dementia patients compared to age-matched controls. The results were striking, showing a significant increase of progenitor cells in both the subventricular zone and in peri-infarct area in patients with vascular dementia compared to controls, which was sustained even in patients with infarcts occurring more than three months prior to autopsy. Moreover, the peri-infarct response appeared to be unified with that of the subventricular zone via a stream of cells, with some of them differentiating into immature neurons. We conclude that neurogenesis is stimulated in vascular dementia patients and, specifically, in patients with visible infarcts. Progenitors may migrate from the neurogenic niche to areas of infarction and differentiate into neurons, even three months after cerebrovascular damage, thus implicating the feasibility of enhancing neurogenesis as a novel treatment approach.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine whether an education and supervision intervention could reduce agitation and the use of restraints and antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes.","Four Norwegian nursing homes were randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual or an intervention consisting of a 2-day educational seminar and monthly group guidance for 6 months. One hundred forty-five residents with dementia (based on medical records and corroborated with a Functional Assessment Staging score >or= 4) completed baseline and 6-month intervention assessments and were included in the analyses. The co-primary outcome measures were the proportion of residents subject to interactional restraint and the severity of agitation using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after completion of the intervention at 6 months, and 12 months after baseline. Comparison of change in the 2 groups was made using repeated-measures analysis of variance (CMAI) and Mann-Whitney test (restraints). The study was conducted from 2003 to 2004.","The proportion of residents starting new restraint was lower in the intervention than in the control group at 6-month evaluation (P = .02), but no statistically significant differences were found at 12-month assessment (P = .57).

In addition to cognitive and functional decline, diverse behavioral changes manifest with increasing severity over time, presenting significant management challenges for caregivers and health care professionals. Almost all patients with AD are affected by neuropsychiatric symptoms at some point during their illness; in some cases, symptoms occur prior to diagnosis of the dementia syndrome. Further, behavioral factors have been identified, which may have their origins in particular neurobiological processes, and respond to particular management strategies. Improved clarification of causes, triggers, and presentation of neuropsychiatric symptoms will guide both research and clinical decision-making. Measurement of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is most commonly by means of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory; its utility and future development are discussed, as are the limitations and difficulties encountered when quantifying behavioral responses in clinical trials. Evidence from clinical trials of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, and from neurobiological studies, provides a range of management options that can be tailored to individual needs. We suggest that non-pharmacological interventions (including psychosocial\/psychological counseling, interpersonal management and environmental management) should be attempted first, followed by the least harmful medication for the shortest time possible. Pharmacological treatment options, such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, need careful consideration of the benefits and limitations of each drug class."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gauthier","ForeName":"Serge","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Unit, McGill Center for Studies in Aging, Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Montreal, Canada. serge.gauthier@mcgill.ca"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cummings","ForeName":"Jeffrey","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brodaty","ForeName":"Henry","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Grossberg","ForeName":"George","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robert","ForeName":"Philippe","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lyketsos","ForeName":"Constantine","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"01","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Anticonvulsants"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antidepressive Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Central Nervous System Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","drug therapy","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Anticonvulsants","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Antidepressive Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Central Nervous System Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Counseling"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychotherapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Socioenvironmental Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"221"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"1","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20096151","S1041610209991505","10.1017\/S1041610209991505"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19828952","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"01","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1421-9824","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"28","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2009"}},"Title":"Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders","ISOAbbreviation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord"},"ArticleTitle":"High prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in mild dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"307-13"},"ELocationID":"10.1159\/000247586","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Orthostatic hypotension (OH) and QTc prolongation have potentially important prognostic and therapeutic consequences but have rarely been studied in patients with mild dementia.","Patients with mild dementia were diagnosed according to consensus criteria after comprehensive standardized assessment.

The objective is to identify clinical and neuropathologic differences between Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD) subjects, with and without coexistent AD pathology. Neuropathologic examination was available on subjects diagnosed by clinicopathologic criteria with PDD-AD (N=23) and PDD+AD (N=28). A small subset of subjects with PDD-AD and PDD+AD had received at least 1 standardized neuropsychologic assessment. PDD+AD subjects were significantly older at age of PD onset and death, progressed to onset of dementia in less time, and had a shorter duration of PD symptoms before the onset of dementia. Education, responsiveness of L-dopa and dopaminergic medications, presence of cognitive fluctuations and hallucinations, and mean Mini-Mental State Examination, Global Deterioration Scale, Functional Assessment Staging, and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. The PDD+AD group had significantly greater total plaques, neuritic plaques, total tangles, and Braak stages compared with PDD-AD. This study suggests that it is difficult to distinguish PDD+AD and PDD-AD on the basis of movement, clinical, and neuropsychologic assessment. PDD-AD and PDD+AD have similar degrees of dementia and approximately half of PDD subjects have enough AD pathology to attain a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD.

Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, are the drug class with the best evidence of efficacy, licensed for mild to moderate AD, while the glutamate antagonist memantine has been widely prescribed, often in the later stages of AD. Memantine is licensed for moderate to severe dementia in AD but is not recommended by the England and Wales National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. However, there is little evidence to guide clinicians as to what to prescribe as AD advances; in particular, what to do as the condition progresses from moderate to severe. Options include continuing cholinesterase inhibitors irrespective of decline, adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, or prescribing memantine instead of cholinesterase inhibitors. The aim of this trial is to establish the most effective drug option for people with AD who are progressing from moderate to severe dementia despite treatment with donepezil.","DOMINO-AD is a pragmatic, 15 centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial. Patients with AD, currently living at home, receiving donepezil 10 mg daily, and with Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) scores between 5 and 13 are being recruited. Each is randomized to one of four treatment options: continuation of donepezil with memantine placebo added; switch to memantine with donepezil placebo added; donepezil and memantine together; or donepezil placebo with memantine placebo. 800 participants are being recruited and treatment continues for one year. Primary outcome measures are cognition (SMMSE) and activities of daily living (Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale). Secondary outcomes are non-cognitive dementia symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory), health related quality of life (EQ-5D and DEMQOL-proxy), carer burden (General Health Questionnaire-12), cost effectiveness (using Client Service Receipt Inventory) and institutionalization. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, 6, 18, 30 and 52 weeks. All participants will be subsequently followed for 3 years by telephone interview to record institutionalization.","There is considerable debate about the clinical and cost effectiveness of anti-dementia drugs.

Currently, the only treatment licensed for PDD is rivastigmine, and there are no licensed treatments for DLB. We aimed to test the safety and efficacy of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine in patients with PDD or DLB.","We did a parallel-group, 24-week, randomised controlled study of memantine (20 mg per day) versus placebo at four psychiatric and neurological outpatient clinics in Norway, Sweden, and the UK during 2005-08. Patients were included if they fulfilled the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD) and developed dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM IV) criteria at least 1 year after the onset of motor symptoms (PDD) or met the revised consensus operationalised criteria for DLB. Patients were assigned to a computer-generated randomisation list. All physicians who had contact with patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was clinical global impression of change (CGIC), which ranged from 1 to 7 points, and a low score means a better outcome. Analysis was by intention to treat based on the last observation carried forward. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN89624516.","72 patients with PDD or DLB were randomly assigned and started treatment: 34 with memantine and 38 with placebo. 56 (78%) completed the study. All withdrawals were owing to adverse events, but the proportion of withdrawals was similar in both groups. At week 24 the patients in the memantine group had better CGIC scores than those taking placebo (mean difference 0.7, 95% CI 0.04-1.39; p=0.03). With the exception of improved speed on attentional tasks in the memantine group (a quick test of cognition [AQT] form: difference 12.4, 95% CI 6.0-30.9; p=0.004), there were no significant differences between the groups in secondary outcome measures.","Patients with DLB or PDD might benefit from treatment with memantine, which was well tolerated.

These symptoms are disturbing for individuals with Alzheimer disease, commonly confer risk to the patient and others, and present a major management challenge for clinicians. The most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments for these symptoms-atypical antipsychotics-have a modest but significant beneficial effect in the short-term treatment (over 6-12 weeks) of aggression but limited benefits in longer term therapy. Benefits are less well established for other symptoms of agitation. In addition, concerns are growing over the potential for serious adverse outcomes with these treatments, including stroke and death. A detailed consideration of other pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer disease is, therefore, imperative. This article reviews the increasing evidence in support of psychological interventions or alternative therapies (such as aromatherapy) as a first-line management strategy for agitation, as well as the potential pharmacological alternatives to atypical antipsychotics-preliminary evidence for memantine, carbamazepine, and citalopram is

been no prospective studies of risk factors for falling specific to this patient population, and no successful falls intervention\/prevention trials. This prospective study aimed to identify modifiable risk factors for falling in older people with mild to moderate dementia.","179 participants aged over 65 years were recruited from outpatient clinics in the UK (38 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 32 Vascular dementia (VAD), 30 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 40 Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), 39 healthy controls). A multifactorial assessment of baseline risk factors was performed and fall diaries were completed prospectively for 12 months. Dementia participants experienced nearly 8 times more incident falls (9118\/1000 person-years) than controls (1023\/1000 person-years; incidence density ratio: 7.58, 3.11-18.5). In dementia, significant univariate predictors of sustaining at least one fall included diagnosis of Lewy body disorder (proportional hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age and sex: 3.33, 2.11-5.26), and history of falls in the preceding 12 months (HR: 2.52, 1.52-4.17). In multivariate analyses, significant potentially modifiable predictors were symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (HR: 2.13, 1.19-3.80), autonomic symptom score (HR per point 0-36: 1.055, 1.012-1.099), and Cornell depression score (HR per point 0-40: 1.053, 1.01-1.099). Higher levels of physical activity were protective (HR per point 0-9: 0.827, 0.716-0.956).","The management of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, autonomic symptoms and depression, and the encouragement of physical activity may provide the core elements for the most fruitful strategy to reduce falls in people with dementia. Randomised controlled trials to assess such a strategy are a priority."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Allan","ForeName":"Louise

large vessel infarction and relative preservation of cognition.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1858-65"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/brain\/awp069","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Vascular dementia accounts for approximately 15-20% of all dementias. In addition, a significant subset of people with Alzheimer's disease have concurrent cerebrovascular disease. Vascular dementia is caused by different cerebrovascular morphological abnormalities including large artery territory infarction (multi-infarct vascular dementia) and sub-cortical ischaemic vascular dementia. Despite this distinction, there is a lack of studies examining the neurochemistry of individual vascular dementia subtypes. Serotonin is believed to play an important role in cognition, and serotonin receptors may provide a novel target for future anti-dementia therapeutics. This study aimed to determine levels of two serotonin receptors in subtypes of vascular dementia and relate any changes to cognition. We have determined, using saturation radioligand binding, the binding parameters (affinity and maximal binding) of ((3)H)-WAY 100635 binding to 5-HT(1A) receptors and ((3)H)-ketanserin binding to 5-HT(2A) receptors in post-mortem tissue from the frontal and temporal cortices of patients with either multi-infarct vascular dementia, sub-cortical ischaemic vascular dementia, mixed Alzheimer's disease\/vascular dementia or stroke no dementia (SND). 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor binding was significantly increased in the temporal cortex of patients with either multi-infarct vascular dementia or SND, compared to age-matched controls. 5-HT(1A) receptor maximal binding in the temporal cortex was also positively correlated with cognition as determined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cambridge Assessment of Mental Health for the Elderly scores (CAMCOG). These results reveal an important distinction between the neurochemistry of multi-infarct vascular dementia\/SND and sub-cortical ischaemic vascular dementia, suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of serotonin offers the possibility to develop novel therapies for stroke and multi-infarct vascular dementia patients. The results also highlight the importance of the cortical 5-HT(1A) receptor in mediating cognition."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Elliott","ForeName":"Mark S J","Initials":"MS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"King's College London, Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kalaria","ForeName":"Rajesh N","Initials":"RN"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hortob\u00e1gyi","ForeName":"Tibor","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Francis","ForeName":"Paul T","Initials":"PT"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"G0400074","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"G0500247","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"G0502157","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"G0600676","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2009","Month":"05","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Brain","NlmUniqueID":"0372537","ISSNLinking":"0006-8950"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A"},{"RegistryNumber":"112692-38-3","NameOfSubstance":"Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A"}]},"CitationSubset":["AIM","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Multi-Infarct","QualifierName":["metabolism","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Vascular","QualifierName":["metabolism","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Prefrontal Cortex","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Stroke","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Temporal Lobe","QualifierName":"metabolism"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"5","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"5","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"9","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19433439","awp069","10.1093\/brain\/awp069"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19282245","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"04","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1474-4422","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"8","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"The Lancet.

In vitro and in animal studies, ChEIs have been shown to influence the processing of Abeta and the phosphorylation of tau, proteins that are the principal constituents of the plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, in AD brain. However, little is known about the effects of these drugs on Abeta and tau pathology in AD. Using avidin-biotin immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis, we compared Abeta and tau loads in the frontal and temporal cortices of 72 brains from matched cohorts of AD patients who had or had not received ChEIs. Patients treated with ChEIs had accumulated significantly more phospho-tau in their cerebral cortex than had untreated patients (P = 0.004). Abeta accumulation was reduced but not significantly. These data raise the possibility that increased tau phosphorylation may influence long-term clinical responsiveness to ChEIs."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chalmers","ForeName":"Katy A","Initials":"KA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia

We aimed to assess whether continued treatment with antipsychotics in people with AD is associated with an increased risk of mortality.","Between October, 2001, and December, 2004, patients with AD who resided in care facilities in the UK were enrolled into a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel, two-group treatment discontinuation trial. Participants were randomly assigned to continue with their antipsychotic treatment (thioridazine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine, or risperidone) for 12 months or to switch their medication to an oral placebo. The primary outcome was mortality at 12 months. An additional follow-up telephone assessment was done to establish whether each participant was still alive 24 months after the enrollment of the last participant (range 24-54 months). Causes of death were obtained from death certificates. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) and modified intention to treat (mITT). This trial is registered with the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials\/National Research Register, number ISRCTN33368770.","165 patients were randomised (83 to continue antipsychotic treatment and 82 to placebo), of whom 128 (78%) started treatment (64 continued with their treatment and 64 received placebo). There was a reduction in survival in the patients who continued to receive antipsychotics compared with those who received placebo. Cumulative probability of survival during the 12 months was 70% (95% CI 58-80%) in the continue treatment group versus 77% (64-85%) in the placebo group for the mITT population. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality for the whole study period showed a significantly increased risk of mortality for patients who were allocated to continue antipsychotic treatment compared with those allocated to placebo (mITT log rank p=0.03; ITT p=0.02). The hazard ratio for the mITT group was 0.58 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.95) and 0.58 (0.36 to 0.92) for the ITT population. The more pronounced differences between groups during periods of follow up longer than 12 months were evident at specific timepoints (24-month survival 46%vs 71%; 36-month survival 30%vs 59%).","There is an increased long-term risk of mortality in patients with AD who are prescribed antipsychotic medication; these results further highlight the need to seek less harmful alternatives for the long-term treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in these patients.","UK Alzheimer's Research Trust."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London, London, UK. clive.ballard@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hanney","ForeName":"Maria Luisa","Initials":"ML"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Theodoulou","ForeName":"Megan","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Douglas","ForeName":"Simon","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McShane","ForeName":"Rupert","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kossakowski","ForeName":"Katja","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gill","ForeName":"Randeep","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Juszczak","ForeName":"Edmund","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Yu","ForeName":"Ly-Mee","Initials":"LM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jacoby","ForeName":"Robin","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"DART-AD investigators"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN33368770"}}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2009","Month":"01","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Lancet Neurol","NlmUniqueID":"101139309","ISSNLinking":"1474-4422"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":[{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Lancet Neurol. 2009 Feb;8(2):125","PMID":"19161899"},{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Ann Intern Med. 2009 Jun 16;150(12):JC6-8","PMID":"19528553"},{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Evid Based Med. 2009 Aug;14(4):115","PMID":"19648431"}]},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["drug therapy","mortality","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["drug therapy","mortality","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Kaplan-Meier Estimate"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2009","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2009","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"3","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19138567","S1474-4422(08)70295-3","10.1016\/S1474-4422(08)70295-3"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19111900","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2009","Month":"04","Day":"09"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0304-3940","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"451","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Feb","Day":"20"}},"Title":"Neuroscience letters","ISOAbbreviation":"Neurosci Lett"},"ArticleTitle":"Amyloid beta concentrations in older people with Down syndrome and dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"162-4"},"ELocationID":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2008.12.030","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"People with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease with an early age of onset.

A secondary objective was to evaluate influences on rate of cognitive decline. This analysis used data from participants consenting to pharmacogenetic testing in placebo-controlled rivastigmine studies. Allele frequencies in DLB and PDD were compared using logistic regression. Within the PDD placebo sample, associations with cognitive decline were evaluated (the DLB sample was too small for these evaluations). Fifty-seven DLB and 323 PDD subjects provided APOE and BuChE data. Allelic frequencies were higher in DLB, relative to PDD subjects, for BuChE-K (P = 0.06), APOE epsilon4 (P < 0.001), or both alleles together (P < 0.001). More rapid cognitive decline was seen in PDD patients carrying both alleles, compared with other genotypes. Subjects with hyperhomocysteinemia were associated with more rapid decline in the presence of BuChE-K, with or without APOE epsilon4.

The safe and effective treatment of these symptoms is a key clinical priority, but is a long way from being achieved. Psychological interventions are recommended as the first line treatment strategy in most good practice guidelines, and there is emerging evidence of efficacy for agitation and depression. Neuroleptics remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment, although meta-analyses indicate that they are mainly of benefit for the short-term (up to 12 weeks) treatment of aggression in people with Alzheimer's disease, and there have been increasing concerns about serious adverse effects including mortality. The evidence is limited for other pharmacological approaches for the treatment of agitation, and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease is limited, but post-hoc analyses do indicate that memantine may be a promising therapy and aromatherapy may be a useful alternative. Autopsy studies indicate that the adrenergic system may be an important therapeutic target. Clinical experience suggests that antidepressants are effective in people with severe depression in the context of dementia, but the evidence base regarding the broader value of antidepressants is far from clear.

Analysis of post-mortem cortical tissue indicated levels of the alpha-subunit of the 20S proteasome were significantly reduced in DLB cortex, but not Alzheimer's, in comparison to control and this reduction correlated with both the severity and duration of dementia. Application of proteasome inhibitors to rodent cortical primary neurones in vitro and by direct injection onto rodent cholinergic forebrain neurons in vivo gave rise to dose dependent neuronal death and in rodent cortex -- marked cholinergic deficits accompanied by the accumulation of inclusions that stained positive for alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).","165 patients were randomised (83 to continue treatment and 82 to placebo, i.e., discontinue treatment), of whom 128 (78%) commenced treatment (64 continue\/64 placebo). Of those, 26 were lost to follow-up (13 per arm), resulting in 51 patients per arm analysed for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference between the continue treatment and placebo groups in the estimated mean change in SIB scores between baseline and 6 mo; estimated mean difference in deterioration (favouring placebo) -0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.4 to 5.5), adjusted for baseline value (p = 0.9). For neuropsychiatric symptoms, there was no significant difference between the continue treatment and placebo groups (n = 56 and 53, respectively) in the estimated mean change in NPI scores between baseline and 6 mo; estimated mean difference in deterioration (favouring continue treatment) -2.4 (95% CI -8.2 to 3.5), adjusted for baseline value (p = 0.4). Both results became more pronounced at 12 mo. There was some evidence to suggest that those patients with initial NPI >\/= 15 benefited on neuropsychiatric symptoms from continuing treatment.","For most patients with AD, withdrawal of neuroleptics had no overall detrimental effect on functional and cognitive status.

Little is known about inflammatory processes in the brains of these individuals. We have examined inflammatory mediators (interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1alpha, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha) and chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1, monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP)-1 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in brain homogenates from grey and white matter of the frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from patients with VaD (n = 11), those with concurrent VaD and AD (mixed dementia; n = 8) and from age-matched controls (n = 13) using ELISA assays. We found a dramatic reduction of MCP-1 levels in the grey matter in VaD and mixed dementia in comparison to controls (55 and 66%, respectively). IL-6 decreases were also observed in the grey matter of VaD and mixed dementia (72 and 71%, respectively), with a more modest decrease (30%) in the white matter of patients with VaD or mixed dementia. In the first study to examine the status of inflammatory mediators in a brain region severely affected by white-matter lesions, our findings highlight - in contrast to previous reports in AD - that patients at the later stage of VaD or mixed dementia have a significantly attenuated neuro-inflammatory response.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2008 S.

The current retrospective analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of memantine in a subpopulation of patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibiting behavioral symptoms of agitation\/aggression or psychosis at baseline.","A pooled analysis was conducted in people with agitation\/aggression or psychosis from 3 large 6-month, randomized studies in moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease. The effect of memantine and placebo on these specific symptoms was evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) subitem cluster of agitation and psychosis.

At both 12 and 24\/28 weeks, there was a significant treatment advantage for memantine over placebo for the proportion of patients showing improvement on the defined neuropsychiatric symptom cluster (55.6% vs. 44.4% at week 12, p = .008; 58.0% vs. 44.8% at week 24\/28, p = .002) and specifically for the treatment of agitation\/aggression (55.3% vs. 43.1% at week 12, p = .011; 61.0% vs. 45.0% at week 24\/28, p < .001). Placebo-treated patients in this population demonstrated an accelerated disease progression for global (Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input), cognitive (Severe Impairment Battery), and functional (Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory 19-item scale) outcomes, but memantine conferred statistically significant benefit for all measures. Tolerability in this population remained good, and fewer memantine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients withdrew due to adverse events.","This post hoc analysis provides important evidence from placebo-controlled trials that memantine may be a safe and effective treatment in Alzheimer's disease patients with agitation\/aggression or psychosis, who are otherwise prone to rapid progression.

In the current article we give a brief overview of the clinical effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, discuss in detail the NICE appraisal of these treatments in the UK as an example of an attempt at a standardised evaluation of cost-effectiveness and discuss a proposed way forward to achieve a unified and consistent approach to the assessment of cost-effectiveness for anti-dementia therapies."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer's Society, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sorensen","ForeName":"Susanne","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sharp","ForeName":"Samantha","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["drug therapy","economics"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost-Benefit Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Care Costs"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services","QualifierName":"ethics"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"33"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"18","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17851194","10.3233\/jad-2007-12106"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17663455","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"06"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"09","Day":"22"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0887-4476","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"61","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Synapse (New York, N.Y.)","ISOAbbreviation":"Synapse"},"ArticleTitle":"Selective loss of dopamine D2 receptors in temporal cortex in dementia with Lewy bodies, association with cognitive decline.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"903-11"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive dementia frequently accompanied by psychotic symptoms. Similar symptoms can occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to a lesser extent. The use of neuroleptic medication to treat psychosis in both diseases is of modest efficacy and can induce severe adverse reactions in DLB. Dopamine D2 receptors in the cerebral cortex are the putative target for the antipsychotic action of these drugs, but the status of these receptors in DLB is unknown. Autoradiography was used to examine the density D2 receptors in postmortem temporal cortex tissue from prospectively assessed patients with neuropathologically confirmed DLB and AD. D2 receptors were substantially (over 40%) and significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in temporal cortex in DLB, and in DLB with concomitant Alzheimer pathology, but was not significantly changed in AD. This reduction correlated with greater cognitive decline (P < 0.01), but was not significantly related to visual or auditory hallucinations or delusions. D2 receptor density was inversely correlated with cortical Lewy body pathology in the neocortex (P < 0.001). The specific loss of D2 receptors associated with Lewy body pathology, in conjunction with our previous finding of low D2 receptors in striatum in DLB, provides a possible explanation for neuroleptic intolerance. That the reduction of D2 receptors correlated with cognitive decline suggests that neuroleptics, as dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, may have a deleterious effect on cognition in DLB.","CopyrightInformation":"(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piggott","ForeName":"Margaret A","Initials":"MA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Ageing and Health, Wolfson Research Centre, Newcastle General Hospital, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE4 6BE, United Kingdom. m.a.piggott@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rowan","ForeName":"Elise","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holmes","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McKeith","ForeName":"Ian G","Initials":"IG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jaros","ForeName":"Evelyn","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert H","Initials":"RH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Elaine K","Initials":"EK"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"G0400074","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"G0502157","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Synapse","NlmUniqueID":"8806914","ISSNLinking":"0887-4476"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Benzamides"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Iodine Isotopes"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Pyrrolidines"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptors, Dopamine D2"},{"RegistryNumber":"107188-87-4","NameOfSubstance":"epidepride"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Analysis of Variance"},{"DescriptorName":"Benzamides","QualifierName":"pharmacokinetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain Chemistry","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"etiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Iodine Isotopes","QualifierName":"pharmacokinetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["complications","metabolism","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Postmortem Changes"},{"DescriptorName":"Pyrrolidines","QualifierName":"pharmacokinetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Radiography","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptors, Dopamine D2","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Temporal Lobe","QualifierName":["drug effects","metabolism"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"1","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"7","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"1","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17663455","10.1002\/syn.20441"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17646620","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"08","Day":"16"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1526-632X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"69","Issue":"4 Suppl 1","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Jul","Day":"24"}},"Title":"Neurology","ISOAbbreviation":"Neurology"},"ArticleTitle":"Caregiver preference for rivastigmine patches versus capsules for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"S23-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Alzheimer disease (AD) has a significant impact on caregivers. Administering and managing medications is one of their many daily tasks. More effective modes of drug administration may benefit patient and caregiver, and may improve compliance. A prospective outcome of the IDEAL (Investigation of TransDermal Exelon in ALzheimer's disease) trial was to evaluate caregiver preference for rivastigmine patches compared with capsules. The 24-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled IDEAL trial investigated once-daily rivastigmine patches vs twice-daily capsules in moderate AD patients. Caregivers rated patch adhesion throughout. The AD Caregiver Preference Questionnaire (ADCPQ) assessed patch vs capsule from caregivers' perspective, based on expectations, preferences, and satisfaction with treatment. A total of 1,059 caregivers completed the ADCPQ while their respective patients were on study drug. More than 70% of caregivers preferred the patch to capsules overall. The patch was preferred to capsules with respect to ease of use (p < 0.0001) and ease of following the schedule (p < 0.0001). Caregivers indicated greater satisfaction overall (p < 0.0001) and less interference with daily life (p < 0.01) with the patch vs capsules. The preference substudy of the IDEAL trial demonstrated that caregivers of AD patients preferred patches to capsules for drug delivery. Preference for the patch may indicate reduced caregiver stress, substantiated by greater satisfaction and less interference with daily life. These benefits may lead to improved compliance."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Blesa","ForeName":"Rafael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Hospital de la Sta Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. rblesa@hsp.santpau.es"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orgogozo","ForeName":"Jean-Marc","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lane","ForeName":"Roger","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thomas","ForeName":"Simu K","Initials":"SK"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Neurology","NlmUniqueID":"0401060","ISSNLinking":"0028-3878"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Phenylcarbamates"},{"RegistryNumber":"PKI06M3IW0","NameOfSubstance":"Rivastigmine"}]},"CitationSubset":["AIM","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Administration, Cutaneous"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["drug therapy","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"administration & dosage"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Compliance","QualifierName":["psychology","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Satisfaction","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Phenylcarbamates","QualifierName":"administration & dosage"},{"DescriptorName":"Rivastigmine"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"7","Day":"31","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"8","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"7","Day":"31","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17646620","69\/4_suppl_1\/S23","10.1212\/01.wnl.0000281848.25142.11"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17463193","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"07","Day":"10"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"21"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1064-7481","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"May"}},"Title":"The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Aggressive behavior and neuroleptic medication are associated with increased number of alpha1-adrenoceptors in patients with Alzheimer disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"435-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Aggressive behavior in dementia is a major clinical management problem.","Postmortem brain tissue was obtained from 24 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and 25 comparison cases.

The level of evidence (types) was rated using a standard system: Types 1a and 1b (evidence from meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials or at least one controlled trial respectively); types 2a and 2b (one well-designed study or one other type of quasi experimental study respectively); type 3 (non-experimental descriptive studies); and type 4 (expert opinion). There is type 1a evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease; and for the use of bright light therapy and aromatherapy. There is type 1a evidence of no effect of anti inflammatory drugs or statins. There is conflicting evidence regarding oestrogens, with type 2a evidence of a protective effect of oestrogens but 1b evidence of a harmful effect. Type 1a evidence for any effect of B12 and folate will be forthcoming when current trials report. There is type 1b evidence for gingko biloba in producing a modest benefit of cognitive function; cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of people with Lewy body disease (particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms); cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in treatment cognitive impairment associated with vascular dementia; and the effect of metal collating agents (although these should not be prescribed until more data on safety and efficacy are available). There is type 1b evidence to show that neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor vitamin E reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment; and there is no evidence that there is any intervention that can prevent the onset of dementia. There is type 1b evidence for the beneficial effects of adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, and type 2b evidence of positive switching outcomes from one cholinesterase inhibitor to another. There is type 2a evidence for a positive effect of reminiscence therapy, and type 2a evidence that cognitive training does not work. There is type 3 evidence to support the use of psychological interventions in dementia. There is type 2 evidence that a clinical diagnosis of dementia can be made accurately and that brain imaging increases that accuracy. Although the consensus statement dealt largely with medication, the role of dementia care in secondary services (geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry) and primary care, along with health economics, was discussed.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 10; 5 male), DLB (n = 9; 4 male) and controls (n = 13; 5 male) performed three functional MRI (fMRI) scanning experiments involving visual colour, face or motion stimuli. Reaction time or accuracy in DLB and Alzheimer's disease differed significantly from controls but not between patient groups, with the exception of accuracy in the face task (DLB < Alzheimer's disease; P = 0.038). The most significant fMRI activations in the pooled data set were in left V4alpha for the colour task (Talairach coordinate: -30, -52, -24; P = 0.002 corrected), the right fusiform face area (FFA) for the face task (34, -48, -22; P = 0.005 corrected) and right intra-parietal sulcus (30, -66, 42; P = 0.003 corrected) for the motion task, with additional activity in right V5 (48, -64, 0; P = 0.015 corrected). Each task was associated with decreases in activity within the default network with prominent deactivation foci bilaterally in the posterior cingulate gyrus (+\/-8, -48, 26; left P < 0.001; right P < 0.001 corrected) and medial frontal cortex (+\/-18, 42, 32; left P < 0.001; right P < 0.001 corrected). Comparing patterns of task-related activity across groups, DLB patients showed more activation than Alzheimer patients within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for the motion task (right STS: 44, 0, -20; P = 0.004 corrected; left STS: -40, -4, -26; P = 0.07 corrected). This difference could not be attributed to task performance, cognitive score or age [analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)F (2, 18) = 8.44, P = 0.003]. Within regions of interest, group activation differences were found for the face task (Alzheimer's disease > DLB P = 0.05; Alzheimer's disease > controls P = 0.14) and the motion task (DLB < Alzheimer's disease P = 0.031 and DLB < control P = 0.048). However, these differences could be explained by behavioural performance, failing to reach significance in the ANCOVA analysis. In the default network, group deactivation differences between controls and both patient groups were found for the colour and motion task (colour: control < Alzheimer's disease P = 0.02; control < DLB P = 0.019; motion: control < Alzheimer's disease P = 0.118; control < DLB P = 0.118) but could be accounted for by behavioural performance. The results suggest that cognitive fMRI can be used to detect both performance-dependent and performance-independent differences between Alzheimer's disease and DLB, reflecting the distribution of functional pathology in the two conditions."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sauer","ForeName":"Justin","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"King's College London, MRC Centre for Neurodegeneration Research, Section of Old Age Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry London, UK. j.sauer@iop.kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"ffytche","ForeName":"Dominic H","Initials":"DH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brown","ForeName":"Richard G","Initials":"RG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Howard","ForeName":"Robert","Initials":"R"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"Agency":"Wellcome Trust","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2006","Month":"05","Day":"02"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Brain","NlmUniqueID":"0372537","ISSNLinking":"0006-8950"},"CitationSubset":["AIM","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain Mapping","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Color Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"Face"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Magnetic Resonance Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Motion Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"Occipital Lobe","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Pattern Recognition, Visual"},{"DescriptorName":"Photic Stimulation","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Reaction Time"},{"DescriptorName":"Temporal Lobe","QualifierName":"physiopathology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"5","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"8","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"5","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16670180","awl102","10.1093\/brain\/awl102"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16543297","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"04","Day":"10"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1756-1833","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"332","Issue":"7544","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Apr","Day":"01"}},"Title":"BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ"},"ArticleTitle":"Effect of enhanced psychosocial care on antipsychotic use in nursing home residents with severe dementia: cluster randomised trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"756-61"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To evaluate the effectiveness of a training and support intervention for nursing home staff in reducing the proportion of residents with dementia who are prescribed neuroleptics.","Cluster randomised controlled trial with blinded assessment of outcome.","12 specialist nursing homes for people with dementia in London, Newcastle, and Oxford.","Residents of the 12 nursing homes; numbers varied during the study period.","Training and support intervention delivered to nursing home staff over 10 months, focusing on alternatives to drugs for the management of agitated behaviour in dementia.","Proportion of residents in each home who were prescribed neuroleptics and mean levels of agitated and disruptive behaviour (Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory) in each home at 12 months.","At 12 months the proportion of residents taking neuroleptics in the intervention homes (23.0%) was significantly lower than that in the control homes (42.1%): average reduction in neuroleptic use 19.1% (95% confidence interval 0.5% to 37.7%).

symptoms; Parkinsonism, visual hallucinations or disturbances of consciousness\/fluctuating attention. Dementia in Parkinson's disease (PDD) has similar neuropsychiatric characteristics. Reduced nigrothalamic dopamine and altered thalamic D2 receptors may mediate some of the non-motor symptoms of DLB and PDD. The study aims were to ascertain whether thalamic D2 density was altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), PDD and DLB, and whether D2 density was related to core symptoms. Thalamic D2 receptor binding was measured by post-mortem autoradiography in 18 cases of DLB, 13 PDD, 6 PD and 14 normal elderly controls. Highest D2 density in control cases was in the intralaminar, midline, anterior and mediodorsal nuclei. In PD without dementia D2 binding was elevated above controls in all thalamic regions, significantly in reticular, laterodorsal, centromedian, ventral centromedian, parafascicular, paraventricular, ventroposterior, ventrolateral posterior, and ventrointermedius nuclei. Compared to controls, DLB cases with Parkinsonism (DLB+EPS) had significantly elevated D2 receptor density in laterodorsal and ventrointermedius nuclei; PDD cases had significantly raised density in the ventrointermedius, and DLB cases without Parkinsonism (DLB-EPS) did not show increased D2 density in any areas. In DLB and PDD cases with disturbances of consciousness, cases treated with neuroleptics had higher D2 binding in all thalamic regions, significantly in the mediodorsal and ventrolateral posterior nuclei. D2 receptor binding did not vary with cognitive decline (MMSE) or visual hallucinations, but was significantly higher with increased extrapyramidal symptoms."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piggott","ForeName":"Margaret A","Initials":"MA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"IAH Research Laboratories, Institute for Ageing and Health, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Newcastle General Hospital, Westgate Road, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. m.a.piggott@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dickinson","ForeName":"Heather O","Initials":"HO"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McKeith","ForeName":"Ian G","Initials":"IG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert H","Initials":"RH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Elaine K","Initials":"EK"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2006","Month":"02","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Neuropsychopharmacol","NlmUniqueID":"9815893","ISSNLinking":"1461-1457"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptors, Dopamine D2"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Autopsy"},{"DescriptorName":"Autoradiography"},{"DescriptorName":"Basal Ganglia Diseases","QualifierName":["metabolism","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebral Cortex","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Consciousness Disorders","QualifierName":["metabolism","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["etiology","metabolism","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Hallucinations","QualifierName":["metabolism","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Bodies","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["metabolism","pathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Movement Disorders","QualifierName":["metabolism","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Parkinson Disease","QualifierName":["complications","metabolism","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Receptors, Dopamine D2","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Thalamic Nuclei","QualifierName":["metabolism","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Thalamus","QualifierName":["metabolism","pathology"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"11"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2005","Month":"12","Day":"08"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2005","Month":"12","Day":"19"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"2","Day":"2","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"4","Day":"17","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"2","Day":"2","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16448581","S146114570600647X","10.1017\/S146114570600647X"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16263847","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"01","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0002-953X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"162","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"The American journal of psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"The pattern of cognitive performance in CADASIL: a monogenic condition leading to subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2078-85"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Subcortical ischemic vascular lesions, which are closely related to small vessel disease, are a common substrate of cognitive impairment and dementia. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a monogenic variant of small vessel disease resulting from mutations in NOTCH3. Mutation carriers almost invariably develop cognitive deficits and eventually dementia. The current study describes the profile of cognitive abnormalities in CADASIL subjects.","A cross-sectional study of 65 mutation carriers (mean age=47.3 years, SD=10.5) and 30 matched comparison subjects (mean age=47.2 years, SD=14.0) was conducted. Participants underwent a series of assessments that included ratings of global cognition, the cognitive portion of the Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale, and specific tests of executive function and attention with measures of processing speed and error monitoring.","CADASIL subjects had pronounced impairments of the timed measures (Stroop II and III, Trail Making Test, symbol digit, digit cancellation). Measures of error monitoring (Stroop III, Trail Making Test, symbol digit, maze task) were also significantly affected but to a lesser extent. Prominent deficits further included verbal fluency and ideational praxis. Recall, orientation, and receptive language skills were largely preserved. Subgroup analyses indicated a similar profile in subjects with early and advanced impairment of global cognitive performance.","The findings highlight processing speed as the most substantial area of cognitive impairment in CADASIL subjects, with less pronounced yet significant deficits in other aspects of executive performance and attention. This profile of cognitive impairment is present at an early stage and enables the construction of targeted test batteries for clinical trials. It is hypothesized that the profile of dysfunction described here represents the core of the cognitive syndrome associated with small vessel disease and subcortical ischemic vascular lesions."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Peters","ForeName":"Nils","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurology, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Marchioninistrasse 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany. mdichgans@nefo.med.uni-muenchen.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Opherk","ForeName":"Christian","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Danek","ForeName":"Adrian","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Herzog","ForeName":"J\u00fcrgen","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dichgans","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"0370512","ISSNLinking":"0002-953X"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"NOTCH3 protein, human"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptor, Notch3"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptors, Notch"}]},"CitationSubset":["AIM","IM"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attention","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain Ischemia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"CADASIL","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia, Vascular","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Frontal Lobe","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Genetic Variation"},{"DescriptorName":"Heterozygote"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Mutation"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptor, Notch3"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptors, Notch","QualifierName":"genetics"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"11","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"1","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"11","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16263847","162\/11\/2078","10.1176\/appi.ajp.162.11.2078"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16240351","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"03","Day":"14"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2010","Month":"11","Day":"18"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0364-5134","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"58","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Annals of neurology","ISOAbbreviation":"Ann Neurol"},"ArticleTitle":"Neuropathology of dementia in Parkinson's disease: a prospective, community-based study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"773-6"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Twenty-two patients with Parkinson's disease drawn from a community-based study were followed prospectively until their deaths.

There is still no consensus regarding the management of such symptoms. Controlled studies of psychosocial interventions, usually performed in the nursing home setting, report encouraging results. Atypical antipsychotics may be effective in some cases but have a high risk of adverse events. There is emerging evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors may reduce and prevent such symptoms.

Binding was higher in patients with DOC compared to patients without DOC in all thalamic nuclei examined, reaching significance in the reticular and ventral anterior thalamic nuclei. Comparing DLB patients with and without DOC to previously reported controls revealed similar binding levels in patients with DOC and lower binding in patients without DOC, reaching significance in the ventral anterior, indicating preserved nicotinic receptor density in DLB patients with DOC.

The role for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and its inhibition in this scheme has long been accepted, but findings from preclinical experiments and clinical trials have placed butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) alongside AChE as an important contributor to the occurrence, symptoms, progression and responses to treatment in dementia. A number of new lines of evidence suggest that both cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEs) may have broader functions in the CNS than previously thought, which relate to both 'classical' esterase activities of the enzymes as well as non-classical actions unrelated to their enzymatic function. Data suggest involvement of the ChEs in modulating glial activation, cerebral blood flow, the amyloid cascade, and tau phosphorylation. It has therefore been speculated that some actions of the ChEs could affect the underlying disease processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and that pharmacological manipulation with ChE inhibitors may affect long-term disease progression. Focusing on new findings relating to BuChE, we review recent evidence that has extended knowledge into the roles of ChEs in health, disease and aging."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Biomedical Sciences, Wolfson Centre for Age-related Diseases, Hodgkin Building, Guy's Campus, King's College, London, SE1 1UL, UK. clive.ballard@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Greig","ForeName":"Nigel H","Initials":"NH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guillozet-Bongaarts","ForeName":"Angela L","Initials":"AL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Enz","ForeName":"Albert","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Darvesh","ForeName":"Sultan","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United Arab Emirates","MedlineTA":"Curr Alzheimer Res","NlmUniqueID":"101208441","ISSNLinking":"1567-2050"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"EC 3.1.1.7","NameOfSubstance":"Acetylcholinesterase"},{"RegistryNumber":"EC 3.1.1.8","NameOfSubstance":"Butyrylcholinesterase"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Acetylcholinesterase","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Animals"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["physiology","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Butyrylcholinesterase","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"141"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"10","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"25","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15974896","10.2174\/1567205054367838"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15945588","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"09","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"09"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1041-6102","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Drugs used to relieve behavioral symptoms in people with dementia or an unacceptable chemical cosh? Argument.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"4-12; discussion 22-9"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"As clinicians we talk about \"the best interests of our patients\". How can a treatment which doubles the rate of cognitive decline, triples the rate of stroke, doubles mortality, substantially increases falls and fractures and reduces quality of life be beneficial, especially, as in real life, once neuroleptics are started they are rarely discontinued with cumulative adverse effects? As there is clearly no rational reason for prescribing, we need to consider other explanations. We would suggest the following: Therapeutic impotence: Doctors, especially specialists feel they need to do something, and prescribing a familiar drug is the easiest option. Ignorance: Doctors are either unaware of the substantial evidence of harm with neuroleptics or are swayed by slick marketing information, portraying atypical neuroleptics in an \"over-safe\" light that does not reflect the actual data. Placebo effect: If neuroleptics are prescribed, the majority of patients experience an improvement in BPSD symptoms. This reinforces the apparent value of this practice, as we like to take the credit for any improvements that occur. The reality is that the majority of people would have experienced a comparable improvement with monitoring. Bowing to pressure: Sometimes the pressure to respond can be great, and a prescription is an easy way to relieve the pressure. This is understandable, and reflects a similar phenomenon to that of general practioners prescribing antibiotics for sore throats. In neither situation does it represent good practice. Lack of skills to implement non-pharmacological alternatives: The main evidence for alternative treatment options are for therapies that by and large are not a core part of the physician or psychiatrist's skill-base, such as psychological interventions. Doctors therefore feel uncomfortable pursuing these options. Why for example is so little time spent on the nonpharmacological interventions that everyone agrees should be the first line of treatment for BPSD in people with dementia? It is largely assumed that the \"enlightened clinician has already appropriately assessed and diagnosed the patient and exhausted all the possible environmental and behavioral interventions before resorting to the prescription pad.\" Accumulating evidence clearly indicates that the need for psychotropic medication is substantially reduced by proactive services or interventions which can provide training and promote psychological, social and environmental and sensory interventions. The prescription but is an easy but not an acceptable alternative. Over-adherence to prescribing guidance: There are pharmacological alternatives to neuroleptics if a prescription is needed. Although the evidence for the more promising alternatives needs to be developed much further, drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors may offer a much less harmful alternative. The reluctance of clinicians to use cholinesterase inhibitors in this way is puzzling, and presumably is because of the culture of \"guidance-prescribing\" that has evolved around these agents. If the treatment of BPSD is to move forward, we need to challenge the way we have always done things, examine the evidence and move forward with new and flexible multi-disciplinary approaches if we are truly to look after the \"best interests of our patients\"."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Psychiatry, London, UK. clive.ballard@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cream","ForeName":"Julia","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Comment"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"12794-10-4","NameOfSubstance":"Benzodiazepines"},{"RegistryNumber":"L6UH7ZF8HC","NameOfSubstance":"Risperidone"},{"RegistryNumber":"N7U69T4SZR","NameOfSubstance":"Olanzapine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentOn"},"RefSource":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2005 Mar;17(1):12-22; discussion 22-9","PMID":"15945589"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Accidental Falls","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Benzodiazepines","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebrovascular Disorders","QualifierName":["epidemiology","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition","QualifierName":"drug effects"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":["diagnosis","drug therapy","etiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Olanzapine"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Risperidone","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"11","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"11","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15945588","10.1017\/s1041610205221026"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15922057","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"08","Day":"02"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0166-4328","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"161","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Jun","Day":"20"}},"Title":"Behavioural brain research","ISOAbbreviation":"Behav Brain Res"},"ArticleTitle":"Muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors in anterior cingulate cortex: relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"299-305"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Alterations in cholinergic functions have been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Increased M1 muscarinic receptor binding in temporal cortex is associated with delusions in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients and increased M2\/M4 receptor binding with psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relation between M2 and M4 muscarinic receptor and psychotic symptoms in DLB is unknown. The aim of this study was to measure M2 and M4 receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex in DLB and to correlate the neurochemical findings with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Muscarinic M2 and M4 receptor levels in the anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 32) were measured separately by using a radioligand binding protocol based on binding of [(3)H]AF-DX 384 in the presence and absence of dicyclomine, a potent M4 receptor antagonist. M2 receptor binding was significantly increased, while M4 receptor binding was unchanged in the cingulate cortex and BA32 of DLB patients compared with age-matched controls. Impaired consciousness was significantly associated with increased M4 binding and delusions were significantly associated with increased M2 binding. Increased M2 and M4 receptor binding in DLB was also associated with visual hallucinations. Upregulation of M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors in cingulate and adjacent cortex may thus contribute to the development of psychosis in DLB, with potential implications for treatments with drugs acting on these receptors."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Teaktong","ForeName":"Thanasak","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Ageing and Health, MRC Building, Newcastle General Hospital, Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE46BE, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piggott","ForeName":"Margaret A","Initials":"MA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mckeith","ForeName":"Ian G","Initials":"IG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert H","Initials":"RH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Elaine K","Initials":"EK"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2005","Month":"03","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"Behav Brain Res","NlmUniqueID":"8004872","ISSNLinking":"0166-4328"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Muscarinic Antagonists"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptor, Muscarinic M2"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Receptor, Muscarinic M4"},{"RegistryNumber":"10028-17-8","NameOfSubstance":"Tritium"},{"RegistryNumber":"118290-27-0","NameOfSubstance":"AFDX 384"},{"RegistryNumber":"3G0285N20N","NameOfSubstance":"Pirenzepine"},{"RegistryNumber":"4KV4X8IF6V","NameOfSubstance":"Dicyclomine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Analysis of Variance"},{"DescriptorName":"Autoradiography"},{"DescriptorName":"Binding, Competitive","QualifierName":"drug effects"},{"DescriptorName":"Case-Control Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dicyclomine","QualifierName":"pharmacology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Gyrus Cinguli","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Hallucinations","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Muscarinic Antagonists","QualifierName":"pharmacology"},{"DescriptorName":"Pirenzepine","QualifierName":["analogs & derivatives","pharmacokinetics"]},{"DescriptorName":"Postmortem Changes"},{"DescriptorName":"Radioligand Assay","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Radionuclide Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptor, Muscarinic M2","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Receptor, Muscarinic M4","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Tritium","QualifierName":"pharmacokinetics"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"16"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"18"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"1","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2005","Month":"8","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"6","Day":"1","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15922057","S0166-4328(05)00065-3","10.1016\/j.bbr.2005.02.019"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15913843","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"04","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"09","Day":"22"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0197-4580","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"27","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Neurobiology of aging","ISOAbbreviation":"Neurobiol Aging"},"ArticleTitle":"Lewy body disease: thalamic cholinergic activity related to dementia and parkinsonism.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"433-8"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Within the spectrum of Lewy body disease cognitive impairment occurs in PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

These findings show that significant thalamic presynaptic cholinergic deficits occur only in cases of combined cortical and subcortical neurodegeneration in which dementia developed after prolonged parkinsonism."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ziabreva","ForeName":"Iryna","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Ageing and Health, MRC Building, Newcastle General Hospital, Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 6BE, UK. iryna.ziabreva@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aarsland","ForeName":"Dag","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Larsen","ForeName":"Jan-Petter","Initials":"JP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McKeith","ForeName":"Ian G","Initials":"IG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert H","Initials":"RH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Elaine K","Initials":"EK"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"G0400074","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Controlled Clinical Trial","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Neurobiol Aging","NlmUniqueID":"8100437","ISSNLinking":"0197-4580"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"EC 2.3.1.6","NameOfSubstance":"Choline O-Acetyltransferase"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Choline O-Acetyltransferase","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":"enzymology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Parkinson Disease","QualifierName":"enzymology"},{"DescriptorName":"Thalamus","QualifierName":"enzymology"},{"DescriptorName":"Tissue Distribution"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2004","Month":"05","Day":"18"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"16"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"28"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2005","Month":"5","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"4","Day":"14","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2005","Month":"5","Day":"26","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["15913843","S0197-4580(05)00087-4","10.1016\/j.neurobiolaging.2005.02.004"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15889951","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"07","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0160-6689","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"66","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"May"}},"Title":"The Journal of clinical psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"J Clin Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Neuroleptic sensitivity in Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian dementias.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"633-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Severe sensitivity to neuroleptic agents is a major clinical problem in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), but has not been determined in Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD with dementia (PDD).","Severe neuroleptic sensitivity reactions (NSRs) were evaluated according to an operationalized definition blind to clinical and neuropathologic diagnoses in prospectively studied patients exposed to neuroleptics from 2 centers.

Many of these drugs selectively inhibit acetylcholinesterase but some agents inhibit both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Recent evidence from studies examining butyrylcholinesterase in post mortem brain samples from dementia patients and examining the relationship between butyrylcholinesterase polymorphisms and the progression of cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease add to a body of work suggesting that butyrylcholinesterase is present in key brain areas and may influence the maturation of plaques in Alzheimer's disease. These accumulating data suggest that butyrylcholinesterase contributes to disease progression in people with dementia, which may be particularly important in individuals with more severe dementia as butyrylcholinesterase activity increases with disease development.

To determine whether there are selective associations between alterations in alpha6\/alpha3 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the two key neuropsychiatric features of DLB, impaired consciousness (IC) and visual hallucinations (VH), quantitative [(125)I]-alpha-conotoxin MII ([(125)I]-alpha-Ctx MII) autoradiography was undertaken on 28 people with DLB and 15 control cases from the Newcastle Brain Bank. There was a highly significant overall trend for reduced thalamic [(125)I]-alpha-Ctx MII binding in DLB (p < 0.001), with significant deficits in the centromedian, ventral lateral and ventroposterior medial thalamic nuclei (p < 0.05), together with caudate and putamen (p < 0.001). [(125)I]-alpha-Ctx MII binding was significantly lower in DLB cases with IC than without IC in the putamen (p < 0.05), however there was no significant association between [(125)I]-alpha-Ctx MII binding and VH. Reductions in [(125)I]-alpha-Ctx MII binding in caudate and putamen were paralleled by similar reductions in [(125)I]PE2I binding. [(125)I]PE2I binding was also significantly lower in DLB cases with IC than without IC in the caudate (p < 0.05) and putamen (p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that deficits in alpha6\/alpha3 nAChRs occur in specific brain regions in DLB, may in part be related to the loss of dopaminergic neurons and may contribute to the development of impaired consciousness in the disorder."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ray","ForeName":"Melissa","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for

These issues are particularly important in the pharmacologic management of behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia (BPSD). Although these symptoms can be very distressing for some patients, the overall relationship of the symptoms with QoL is far less clear. In addition, although antipsychotic agents have moderate efficacy in the short- to medium-term management of these symptoms, it cannot be assumed that symptom resolution automatically equates with improved QoL. This is of particular concern in light of the adverse side effect profiles of many of these agents. Indeed, the only empirical study in this area conducted to date indicated that antipsychotics are associated with a worse QoL for nursing home patients. Unfortunately, none of the placebo-controlled trials of antipsychotics for the treatment of BPSD have included formal QoL measures, although preliminary evidence indicates that atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine may result in QoL improvements. The inclusion of systematic QoL measures in future clinical trials is imperative in order to provide evidence to enable the clinician to make informed judgments regarding the potential benefits or risks of pharmacologic treatment for individual patients. In addition, such information will facilitate a better understanding of the likely factors that may contribute to the impact of treatment on QoL (e.g., side effects) and hence enable physicians to make rational treatment choices between different pharmacologic agents."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Aging and Health, Wolfson Research Centre, Newcastle General Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. c.g.ballard@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Margallo-Lana","ForeName":"Marisa L","Initials":"ML"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Clin Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"7801243","ISSNLinking":"0160-6689"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Dibenzothiazepines"},{"RegistryNumber":"2S3PL1B6UJ","NameOfSubstance":"Quetiapine Fumarate"},{"RegistryNumber":"L6UH7ZF8HC","NameOfSubstance":"Risperidone"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Choice Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["drug therapy","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dibenzothiazepines","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Double-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Disorders","QualifierName":["drug therapy","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Quetiapine Fumarate"},{"DescriptorName":"Risperidone","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"58"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"22","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"8","Day":"20","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2004","Month":"7","Day":"22","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15264968"}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15121649","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"06","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2010","Month":"11","Day":"18"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0002-953X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"161","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"May"}},"Title":"The American journal of psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Neuropathological substrates of psychiatric symptoms in prospectively studied patients with autopsy-confirmed dementia with lewy bodies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"843-9"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This investigation was undertaken to clarify the neuropathological substrates of key psychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies.","The authors studied 112 autopsy-confirmed cases of dementia with Lewy bodies in patients who had had annual standardized clinical evaluations until their death.

Consensus criteria state that the core features of DLB are fluctuating cognition with pronounced variation in attention and alertness, recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism. At least two of these features must be present for the diagnosis of probable DLB. Assessments of the validity of the consensus criteria against autopsy generally indicate high specificity but varying sensitivity. More detailed assessments of core diagnostic features or better operationalization, particularly of fluctuating cognition, may help improve the diagnostic guidelines. Greater utilization of some features described as supporting the diagnosis (such as auditory hallucinations) and the potential inclusion of additional symptoms (such as REM sleep behavioral disorder) also may be useful. In addition, the potential role of more detailed neuropsychology and neuroimaging in the diagnostic process needs to be evaluated, although it is important that changes to the diagnostic criteria are based on empirical evidence. Other key issues pertain to the classification of DLB patients with concurrent Alzheimer's disease and the differentiation of DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia based on less than a 1-year history of parkinsonism preceding the dementia.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2004 S.

Acetylcholine plays a key role in attention and memory and reduced cortical acetylcholine is associated with the severity of dementia. Inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase are an effective dementia treatment, though the role of the related enzyme butyrylcholinesterase is less well understood.","We examined the response of a cohort of dementia patients enrolled in a trial of a cholinesterase inhibitor who had been genotyped at the butyrylcholinesterase locus. Additionally a prospectively assessed cohort of dementia patients was genotyped and rate of cognitive decline examined, along with baseline cognitive performance in a group of elderly non-demented individuals. We identified that the presence of reduced-activity butyrylcholinesterase variants correlates with preserved attentional performance and reduced rate of cognitive decline. During cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, patients with normal butyrylcholinesterase show improved attention, though patients carrying reduced-activity enzyme do not, possibly due to being at ceiling performance. Butyrylcholinesterase did not however affect attentional performance in non-demented individuals with mild cognitive impairment.","These findings indicate that the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme is a major regulator of attention especially in cholinergic deficiency states through its ability to hydrolyse acetylcholine.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a primary, neurodegenerative dementia sharing clinical and pathological characteristics with both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antiubiquitin immunocytochemical staining, developed in the early 1990s, allowed the frequency and distribution of cortical LBs to be defined. More recently, alpha-synuclein antibodies have revealed extensive neuritic pathology in DLB demonstrating a neurobiological link with other \"synucleinopathies\" including PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The most significant correlates of cognitive failure in DLB appear to be with cortical LB and Lewy neurites (LNs) rather than Alzheimer type pathology. Clinical diagnostic criteria for DLB, published in 1996, have been subjected to several validation studies against autopsy findings. These conclude that although diagnostic specificity is high (range 79- 100%, mean 92%), sensitivity is lower (range 0- 83 %, mean, 49%). Improved methods of case detection are therefore required. Fluctuating impairments in attention, visual recognition and construction are more indicative of DLB than AD. Relative preservation of medial temporal lobe volume on structural MRI and the use of SPECT tracers for regional blood flow and the dopamine transporter are the most reliable current biomarkers for DLB. There are no genetic or CSF tests recommended for the diagnosis of DLB at present. Between 15 and 20% of all elderly demented cases reaching autopsy have DLB, making it the most common cause of degenerative dementia after AD. Exquisite, not infrequently fatal, sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs and encouraging reports of the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive, psychiatric and neurological features, mean that an accurate diagnosis of DLB is more than merely of academic interest. Dementia developing late in the course of PD shares many of the same clinical and pathological characteristics.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2003, Elsevier Science (USA)"},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McKeith","ForeName":"Ian G","Initials":"IG","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Ageing and Health, Wolfson Research Centre, Newcastle General Hospital, Newcastle, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burn","ForeName":"David J","Initials":"DJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Collerton","ForeName":"Daniel","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jaros","ForeName":"Evelyn","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morris","ForeName":"Chris M","Initials":"CM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McLaren","ForeName":"Andrew","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Elaine K","Initials":"EK"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piggott","ForeName":"Margaret A","Initials":"MA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Brien","ForeName":"John T","Initials":"JT"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Semin Clin Neuropsychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"9604647","ISSNLinking":"1084-3612"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Apolipoprotein E4"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Apolipoproteins E"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alleles"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Apolipoprotein E4"},{"DescriptorName":"Apolipoproteins E","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebral Cortex","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Diagnostic Imaging"},{"DescriptorName":"Gene Frequency","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Genes, Dominant","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Bodies","QualifierName":"pathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Parkinson Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","genetics","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"75"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"2","Day":"5","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"4","Day":"18","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"2","Day":"5","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12567332","10.1053\/scnp.2003.50006","S1084361202000096"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12480751","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"01","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"16"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0077-8923","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"977","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","ISOAbbreviation":"Ann N Y Acad Sci"},"ArticleTitle":"Neurocardiovascular instability in cognitive impairment and dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"183-95"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Neurocardiovascular instability (NCVI, neurally mediated disorders causing hypotension with or without bradycardia) represents abnormal neural control of the cardiovascular system and presents as dizziness, syncope, or falls. The mechanisms underpinning NCVI are incompletely understood. The three most common disorders are carotid sinus syndrome (CSS), orthostatic hypotension (OH), and vasovagal syndrome (VVS): CSS, cardioinhibition > 3 s and\/or vasodepressor response > or = 50 mmHg drop in systolic pressure during carotid sinus stimulation; OH: fall in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg during standing; VVS: cardioinhibition > 3 s and\/or vasodepressor response > 50 mmHg during prolonged head-up tilting. In fallers with cognitive impairment or dementia, the prevalence of NCVI is 70%. Multifactorial interventions, including treatment of NCVI, significantly reduce falls and syncope. The predominant components of NCVI in fallers with cognitive impairment and dementia are CSS and OH. In Lewy body and Alzheimer's dementia, the prevalence of NCVI is up to 60%, again predominantly CSS and OH. The prevalence of cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity is particularly high in Lewy body dementia-41% compared with 12% in Alzheimer's disease and 3% in case controls. In addition, patients with Lewy body dementia have greater heart rate slowing (>2 s) and falls in systolic blood pressure (>20 mmHg) than those with Alzheimer's disease or controls during carotid sinus stimulation. The extent of deep white matter hyperintensities on MRI correlates with systolic fall during carotid sinus stimulation (R = 0.58; p < 0.005), suggesting a possible causal association between bradyarrhythmia-induced hypotension and microvascular pathology. NCVI is common in patients with dementia and may be a reversible cause of falls and syncope.

Whilst the presence of Lewy bodies is essential, DLB shares with AD the presence of senile plaques (SP), but neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are not a necessary feature. The apolipoprotein E (APO E) epsilon4 allele is the most consistently associated genetic risk factor for AD and has also been shown to associate with DLB. We have therefore analysed the APO E epsilon4 allele in a large series of DLB cases coming to autopsy to: (1) determine if the epsilon4 allele describes a similar risk in DLB development as in AD and (2) determine how APO E epsilon4 allele status correlates with clinical and neuropathological findings in DLB, and in AD, as an indication of the role of APO E in underlying disease biology. Both DLB and AD share an increased epsilon4 allele frequency, though in DLB the epsilon2 allele frequency is not reduced and there is a relative lack of epsilon4 homozygotes. In contrast to previous studies, no association of the epsilon4 allele with age at onset or duration of disease was found in either disorders. In DLB cases, overall a significantly shorter duration of illness was observed when compared with AD cases, though no significant effect of the epsilon4 allele on disease onset or duration was seen. The survival rate was reduced by the presence of the epsilon4 allele in DLB, as with AD. No effect on SP or NFT counts was seen with the epsilon4 allele, though DLB cases showed a lower SP burden in addition to the expected lower NFT counts. This study demonstrates that DLB shares the APO epsilon4 allele with AD as a common risk factor, but that there are differences in the way the epsilon4 allele affects the phenotypic expression of disease.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright 2002 S.

Major depression was associated with a significant preservation of 5HT transporter re-uptake sites in the parietal neocortex compared with non-affected cases (BA 7a area 1 t = 3.3, P = 0.004; BA 7a area 3 t = 3.8, P = 0.001).","This preliminary report is important in challenging some of the assumptions about cortical monoamine functioning in depressed dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for the Health of the Elderly, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, UK. c.g.ballard@ncl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Johnson","ForeName":"Mary","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Piggott","ForeName":"Margaret","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Robert","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Brien","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rowan","ForeName":"Elise","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry","ForeName":"Elaine","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lantos","ForeName":"Peter","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cairns","ForeName":"Nigel","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holmes","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Affect Disord","NlmUniqueID":"7906073","ISSNLinking":"0165-0327"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Carrier Proteins"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Membrane Glycoproteins"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Membrane Transport Proteins"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Nerve Tissue Proteins"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"SLC6A4 protein, human"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins"},{"RegistryNumber":"02MNR4P2PM","NameOfSubstance":"cianopramine"},{"RegistryNumber":"333DO1RDJY","NameOfSubstance":"Serotonin"},{"RegistryNumber":"OGG85SX4E4","NameOfSubstance":"Imipramine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Autoradiography"},{"DescriptorName":"Binding Sites"},{"DescriptorName":"Carrier Proteins","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depressive Disorder","QualifierName":["complications","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Imipramine","QualifierName":["analogs & derivatives","metabolism"]},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Bodies","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["complications","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Membrane Glycoproteins","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Membrane Transport Proteins"},{"DescriptorName":"Nerve Tissue Proteins"},{"DescriptorName":"Serotonin","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"7","Day":"10","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"2","Day":"25","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"7","Day":"10","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12103469","S016503270000375X","10.1016\/s0165-0327(00)00375-x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"11976799","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"24"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1619-7070","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"29","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"May"}},"Title":"European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging","ISOAbbreviation":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging"},"ArticleTitle":"A comparison of (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPET changes in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease using statistical parametric mapping.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"615-22"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Differences in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and healthy volunteers were investigated using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Forty-eight AD, 23 DLB and 20 age-matched control subjects participated. Technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) brain single-photon emission tomography (SPET) scans were acquired for each subject using a single-headed rotating gamma camera (IGE CamStar XR\/T). The SPET images were spatially normalised and group comparison was performed by SPM99. In addition, covariate analysis was undertaken on the standardised images taking the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as a variable. Applying a height threshold of P < or = 0.001 uncorrected, significant perfusion deficits in the parietal and frontal regions of the brain were observed in both AD and DLB groups compared with the control subjects. In addition, significant temporoparietal perfusion deficits were identified in the AD subjects, whereas the DLB patients had deficits in the occipital region. Comparison of dementia groups (height threshold of P < or = 0.01 uncorrected) yielded hypoperfusion in both the parietal [Brodmann area (BA) 7] and occipital (BA 17, 18) regions of the brain in DLB compared with AD. Abnormalities in these areas, which included visual cortex and several areas involved in higher visual processing and visuospatial function, may be important in understanding the visual hallucinations and visuospatial deficits which are characteristic of DLB. Covariate analysis indicated group differences between AD and DLB in terms of a positive correlation between cognitive test score and temporoparietal blood flow. In conclusion, we found evidence of frontal and parietal hypoperfusion in both AD and DLB, while temporal perfusion deficits were observed exclusively in AD and parieto-occipital deficits in DLB."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Colloby","ForeName":"Sean J","Initials":"SJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Wolfson Research Centre, The Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle General Hospital, Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE4 6BE, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fenwick","ForeName":"John D","Initials":"JD"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Williams","ForeName":"E David","Initials":"ED"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Paling","ForeName":"Sean M","Initials":"SM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lobotesis","ForeName":"Kyriakos","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McKeith","ForeName":"Ian","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Brien","ForeName":"John T","Initials":"JT"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Clinical Trial","Comparative Study","Controlled Clinical Trial","Journal Article"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2002","Month":"03","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Germany","MedlineTA":"Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging","NlmUniqueID":"101140988","ISSNLinking":"1619-7070"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Radiopharmaceuticals"},{"RegistryNumber":"3B744AG22N","NameOfSubstance":"Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Age Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["blood supply","diagnostic imaging"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cerebrovascular Circulation"},{"DescriptorName":"Diagnosis, Differential"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Image Enhancement","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["diagnostic imaging","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Radiopharmaceuticals"},{"DescriptorName":"Reference Values"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Sensitivity and Specificity"},{"DescriptorName":"Sex Factors"},{"DescriptorName":"Statistics as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime"},{"DescriptorName":"Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2002","Month":"4","Day":"27","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"11","Day":"26","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2002","Month":"4","Day":"27","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["11976799","10.1007\/s00259-002-0778-5"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"11813276","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2002","Month":"04","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"05"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"17","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2002","Month":"Feb"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Can psychiatric liaison reduce neuroleptic use and reduce health service utilization for dementia patients residing in care facilities.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"140-5"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The quality of care and overuse of neuroleptic medication in care environments are major issues in the care of elderly people with dementia.","The quality of care (Dementia Care Mapping), the severity of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms (BPSD--Neuropsychiatric Inventory), expressive language skills (Sheffield Acquired Language Disorder scale), service utilization and use of neuroleptic drugs was compared over 9 months between six care facilities receiving a psychiatric liaison service and three facilities receiving the usual clinical support, using a single blind design.","There was a significant reduction in neuroleptic usage in the facilities receiving the liaison service (McNemar test p<0.0001), but not amongst those receiving standard clinical support (McNemar test p=0.07).

Several other studies have attempted to identify additional genetic loci associated with disease development, often based on a candidate gene approach. As several lines of evidence indicate that oxidative stress and free radical damage occur in AD, the transferrin gene (TF) has been suggested as a candidate locus for AD since it is the major transport protein for iron, which itself is a major factor in free radical generation. Previous studies have shown elevated TF C2 allele frequencies in AD, this being specifically associated with carriers of the APO E varepsilon4 allele. We have therefore determined the influence of the common polymorphisms in TF, C1 and C2, in dementia. The frequency of the C2 allele was not significantly associated with AD. Stratification of cases according to the APO E varepsilon4 allele showed a highly significant excess of the C2 allele in AD cases without the varepsilon4 allele, contrasting with previous studies. Given the contrasting findings between reports of altered TF C2 allele frequencies, the TF locus would not appear to be a strong risk factor for AD in this population."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hussain","ForeName":"Rafiqul I","Initials":"RI","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"MRC Building, Institute for the Health of the Elderly, Newcastle General Hospital, Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ballard","ForeName":"Clive G","Initials":"CG"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Edwardson","ForeName":"James A","Initials":"JA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morris","ForeName":"Christopher M","Initials":"CM"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Ireland","MedlineTA":"Neurosci Lett","NlmUniqueID":"7600130","ISSNLinking":"0304-3940"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Apolipoprotein E4"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Apolipoproteins E"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Free Radicals"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Transferrin"},{"RegistryNumber":"E1UOL152H7","NameOfSubstance":"Iron"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["genetics","metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Apolipoprotein E4"},{"DescriptorName":"Apolipoproteins E","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Brain","QualifierName":["metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"DNA Mutational Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Free Radicals","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Gene Frequency"},{"DescriptorName":"Genetic Predisposition to Disease","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Genetic Testing"},{"DescriptorName":"Genotype"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Iron","QualifierName":"metabolism"},{"DescriptorName":"Lewy Body Disease","QualifierName":["genetics","metabolism","physiopathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurons","QualifierName":["metabolism","pathology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Oxidative Stress","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Polymorphism, Genetic","QualifierName":"genetics"},{"DescriptorName":"Transferrin","QualifierName":["genetics","metabolism"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2001","Month":"12","Day":"26","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2002","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"10","Minute":"1"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2001","Month":"12","Day":"26","Hour":"10","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["11750985","S030439400102403X","10.1016\/s0304-3940(01)02403-x"]}}}]}
