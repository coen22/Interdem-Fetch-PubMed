validated quality-of-life (QoL) measures designed for people living with dementia. However, the majority of these are completed via proxy-report, despite indications from community-based studies that consistency between proxy-reporting and self-reporting is limited. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between self- and proxy-reporting of one generic and three disease-specific quality-of-life measures in people living with dementia in care home settings.","As part of a randomised controlled trial, four quality-of-life measures (DEMQOL, EQ-5D-5L, QOL-AD and QUALID) were completed by people living with dementia, their friends or relatives or care staff proxies. Data were collected from 726 people living with dementia living in 50 care homes within England. Analyses were conducted to establish the internal consistency of each measure, and inter-rater reliability and correlation between the measures.","Residents rated their quality of life higher than both relatives and staff on the EQ-5D-5L. The magnitude of correlations varied greatly, with the strongest correlations between EQ-5D-5L relative proxy and staff proxy. Internal consistency varied greatly between measures, although they seemed to be stable across types of participants. There was poor-to-fair inter-rater reliability on all measures between the different raters.","There are large differences in how QoL is rated by people living with dementia, their relatives and care staff. These inconsistencies need to be considered when selecting measures and reporters within dementia

and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are moderately effective and not always tolerated. Tailoring psychosocial approaches in PDD and DLB may offer additional support and improve outcomes. We adapted home-based, care partner-delivered Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) for individuals with PDD or DLB and their care partners (CST-PD).","To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of CST-PD.","This randomised controlled trial used mixed methods, including a process evaluation. People with PDD, DLB or mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) and their care partners were randomised to 12 weeks of treatment as usual (TAU) or CST-PD. Outcomes were feasibility of the study conduct (i.e., recruitment, retention rate) and acceptability and tolerability of the intervention. Measures included rating scales, researcher field notes, therapy diaries, and exploratory clinical and care partner efficacy measures.","The recruitment target was met with 76 consenting participant-dyads. Retention in both arms was high at over 70%. More than 90% of dyads undertook discrete sessions greater than 20\u00a0min duration, but the average number of sessions completed was lower than the recommended dose. Acceptability ratings (i.e., interest, motivation and sense of achievement) of the intervention were high. Participants reported no serious adverse events related to the intervention.","The field of psychosocial interventions for PDD and DLB is newly emerging, and we demonstrated that this type of intervention is acceptable and well tolerated. Evaluating its clinical effectiveness in a full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial is warranted.","The trial is a psychosocial intervention with an allocated ISRCTN number

We used multivariable linear regression to assess relationships between burden, HRQL, and caregiver and patient characteristics.","Of 1020 caregivers at baseline, 569 were followed up at 6\u00a0months, 452 at 12\u00a0months, and 187 at 24\u00a0months. There was a small increase in caregiver burden over 2\u00a0years (effect size 0.30 SD). These changes were not associated with most caregiver or patient characteristics, except socio-economic deprivation, which was associated with larger increases in burden at 2\u00a0years. Caregivers' HRQL was weakly associated with burden and showed a small reduction over time (0.2 SD). Most caregivers were satisfied with services, but caregivers who were not satisfied with the services they received reported greater increases in burden.","Increases in caregiver burden and reductions in HRQL appear to be small over the first 2\u00a0years after attending a MAS.

improves cognition and quality of life in people living with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and restricted mobility are common complications for people with Parkinson's-related dementia (PRD) and may limit access to, and participation in, group activities. This study describes the development of a condition-specific, home-based psychosocial therapy for people with PRD ready to be trialled in a clinical population.","By means of a multistage process, a draft therapy manual was developed in an iterative manner through collaboration with medical experts, researchers and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives. In stage 1, an extensive literature search of psychosocial therapies for dementia with potential relevance for Parkinson's disease (PD) was undertaken to select a candidate therapy for adaptation. In stage 2, qualitative feedback from stakeholders and intelligence regarding existing nonpharmacological therapies for cognitive impairment in PD was combined to produce a prototype therapy manual. In stage 3, the manual was field tested in: 1) a home-setting using a 25-item assessment tool; and 2) at a local PD support group with PPI representatives. Based on the feedback from this phase, final design modifications were implemented and a draft therapy manual produced.","The manual was developed in an iterative manner. Interview and focus group transcripts identified three enduring themes: manual form and content, therapy acceptability by people with PRD, and companion guidance and support. Major adaptations included: removal of discrete levels of task complexity, removal of images that were potentially hallucinogenic or lacked clarity, and updating of the content.","We have successfully developed a Cognitive Stimulation Therapy-based psychosocial therapy specifically adapted for people with PRD.

dementias are at high risk of polypharmacy and excessive polypharmacy for common coexisting medical conditions. Polypharmacy increases the risk of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions in these patients who may not be able to communicate early symptoms of adverse drug events. Three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACHEIs) have been approved for AD: donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Razadyne). They are also used off-label for other causes of dementia such as Lewy body and vascular dementia. We here report evidence from the literature that ACHEI treatment, prescribed for cognitive impairment, can reduce the load of medications in patients with AD by also addressing cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and other comorbidities. Using one drug to address multiple symptoms can reduce costs and improve medication compliance."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kaushik","ForeName":"Vinod","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"1 Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."},{"Affiliation":"2 Sealy Center on Aging, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smith","ForeName":"Sarah Toombs","Initials":"ST","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"1 Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."},{"Affiliation":"2 Sealy Center on Aging, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mikobi","ForeName":"Emmanuel","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Sealy Center on Aging, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."},{"Affiliation":"3 School of Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Raji","ForeName":"Mukaila A","Initials":"MA","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"1 Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."},{"Affiliation":"2 Sealy Center on Aging, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"03"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen","NlmUniqueID":"101082834","ISSNLinking":"1533-3175"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors"},{"RegistryNumber":"0D3Q044KCA","NameOfSubstance":"Galantamine"},{"RegistryNumber":"8SSC91326P","NameOfSubstance":"Donepezil"},{"RegistryNumber":"PKI06M3IW0","NameOfSubstance":"Rivastigmine"}]},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Cardiovascular Diseases"},{"DescriptorName":"Cholinesterase Inhibitors","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Comorbidity"},{"DescriptorName":"Donepezil","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Galantamine","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Polypharmacy"},{"DescriptorName":"Rivastigmine","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer\u2019s disease","acetylcholinesterase inhibitors","comorbidities","off-label use","polypharmacy"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"5","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28974110","10.1177\/1533317517734352"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28873770","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"04","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1879-8365","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"242","PubDate":{"Year":"2017"}},"Title":"Studies in health technology and informatics","ISOAbbreviation":"Stud Health Technol Inform"},"ArticleTitle":"Independent Living Functions for the Elderly (IN-LIFE): Supporting Communication in Dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"16-22"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Independent Living Functions for the Elderly (IN-LIFE) is a 3 year multidisciplinary, multisite European project that aims to prolong and support independent living for people with cognitive impairments, through (ICT) services.

(PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterised by motor and 'non-motor' symptoms which impact on quality of life. Treatment options are generally limited to pharmacological approaches. We developed a psychosocial intervention to improve cognition, quality of life and companion burden for people with MCI-PD, PDD or DLB. Here, we describe the protocol for a single-blind randomised controlled trial to assess feasibility, acceptability and tolerability of the intervention and to evaluate treatment implementation. The interaction among the intervention and selected outcome measures and the efficacy of this intervention in improving cognition for people with MCI-PD, PDD or DLB will also be explored.","Dyads will be randomised into two treatment arms to receive either 'treatment as usual' (TAU) or cognitive stimulation therapy specifically adapted for Parkinson's-related dementias (CST-PD), involving 30\u2009min sessions delivered at home by the study companion three times per week over 10 weeks. A mixed-methods approach will be used to collect data on the operational aspects of the trial and treatment implementation. This will involve diary keeping, telephone follow-ups, dyad checklists and researcher ratings. Analysis will include descriptive statistics summarising recruitment, acceptability and tolerance of the intervention, and treatment implementation. To pilot an outcome measure of efficacy, we will undertake an inferential analysis to test our hypothesis that compared with TAU, CST-PD improves cognition. Qualitative approaches using thematic analysis will also be applied. Our findings will inform a larger definitive trial.","Ethical opinion was granted (REC reference: 15\/YH\/0531). Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and at conferences. We will prepare reports for dissemination by organisations involved with PD and dementia.","ISRCTN (ISRCTN11455062)."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

(MCI) diagnosis from the perspective of those living with the label.","Participants were included if they had recently (within 6\u00a0months) received a MCI diagnosis. We also recruited close family members to gain their perspectives. Each was interviewed separately with a semi-structured topic guide covering three areas: (1) experience of cognitive impairments and changes in the individual; (2) impact of cognitive impairment(s) on daily activities and social relationships; and (3) experience of the diagnosis process and living with the label. Transcribed interviews were stored in Nvivo . Grounded theory procedures of memo writing, open coding, constant comparison, and focused coding were used to derive conceptual themes.","Eighteen dyads were interviewed. The overarching themes surrounding diagnosis benefits and drawbacks were as follows: (1) emotional impact of the diagnosis; (2) practical benefits and limitations of the diagnosis, in terms of (a) understanding one's symptoms and (b) access to clinical support. Although participants were glad to have clinical support in place, they expressed frustration at the lack of clarity, and the lack of available treatments for MCI. Consequently, living with MCI can be characterized as an ambivalent experience.","As a clinical label, MCI appears to have little explanatory power for people living with cognitive difficulties. Work is needed to clarify how clinicians and patients communicate about MCI, and how people can be helped to live well with the label. Despite an emerging body of prognostic studies, people with MCI are likely to continue living with significant uncertainty. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Mild cognitive impairment is a state of cognitive decline between normal cognitive ageing and dementia. This clinical category has been an important domain of academic debate over recent years. From a clinical perspective, diagnosing MCI is a helpful way to enable communication between health professionals, and a diagnosis can be important for patients in need of support and education. However, diagnosis can be fraught with difficulties, while patients have reported significant uncertainty about the label. This study aimed to examine the perceived benefits and drawbacks of receiving a MCI diagnosis. What does this study add? The emotional impact of a MCI diagnosis is complex and raised conflicting and fluctuating emotions in our participants' accounts - most notably worry and relief. Participants were glad to have clinical support available to call on; however, they were frustrated at the lack of 'treatments' available for MCI and were often anxious to slow any cognitive decline down Health psychologists will have an important role to play in understanding and improving clinical communication about MCI."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Aims To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MAS for the diagnosis and follow-up care of patients with suspected dementia. Method We analysed observational data from 1318 patients referred to 69 MAS, and their lay carers (n\u2009=\u2009944), who completed resource use and HRQL questionnaires at baseline, three and six months. We reported mean differences in HRQL (disease-specific DEMQOL and generic EQ-5D-3L), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs between baseline and six months after referral to MAS. We also assessed the cost-effectiveness of MAS across different patient subgroups and clinic characteristics. Results Referral to MAS was associated with gains in DEMQOL (mean gain: 3.48, 95% confidence interval: 2.84 to 4.12), EQ-5D-3L (0.023, 0.008 to 0.038) and QALYs (0.006, 0.002 to 0.01). Mean total cost over six months, assuming a societal perspective, was \u00a31899 (\u00a31277 to \u00a32539). This yielded a negative incremental net monetary benefit of -\u00a31724 (-\u00a32388 to -\u00a31085), assuming NICE's recommended willingness-to-pay threshold (\u00a330,000 per QALY). These base case results were relatively robust to alternative assumptions about costs and HRQL. There was some evidence that patients aged 80 or older benefitted more from referral to MAS (p\u2009<\u20090.01 from adjusted mean differences in net benefits) compared to younger patients. MAS with over 75 new patients a month or cost per patient less than \u00a32500 over six months were relatively more cost-effective (p\u2009<\u20090.01) than MAS with fewer new monthly patients or higher cost per patient. Conclusions Diagnosis, treatment and follow-up care provided by MAS to patients with suspected dementia appears to be effective, but not cost-effective, in the six months after diagnosis. Longer term evidence is required before drawing conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of MAS."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gomes","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 Assistant Professor of Health Economics, Department of Health Services Research & Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pennington","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"2 Senior Lecturer in Health Economics, King's Health Economics, King's College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wittenberg","ForeName":"Raphael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"3 Associate Professorial Research Fellow, Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Knapp","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"4 Professor of Social Policy, Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Black","ForeName":"Nick","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"5 Professor of Health Services Research, Department of Health Services Research & Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smith","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"6 Associate Professor in Psychology, Department of Health Services Research & Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"06","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Health Serv Res Policy","NlmUniqueID":"9604936","ISSNLinking":"1355-8196"},"CitationSubset":"H","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost-Benefit Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Policy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Mass Screening","QualifierName":"economics"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Observation"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality-Adjusted Life Years"},{"DescriptorName":"Referral and Consultation"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["cost-effectiveness analysis","dementia","memory assessment services"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28622732","10.1177\/1355819617714816"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28304290","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"08","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"57","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2017"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"The Efficacy of Emotion Recognition Rehabilitation for People with Alzheimer's Disease.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"937-951"},"ELocationID":"10.3233\/JAD-160940","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The ability to recognize emotional expression is essential for social interactions, adapting to the environment, and quality of life.

We used multivariable regression methods to analyze data from 1420 patients from 73 MAS, and their lay carers (n=1020). The mean age of patients was 78 years; 42% had cognitive function equivalent to Mini-Mental State Examination <24. Characteristics associated with lower function were: older age, being female, deprivation, and nonwhite ethnicity. Deprivation and nonwhite ethnicity were also associated with lower self-reported HRQL, as was having multiple comorbidities; older age was associated with better self-reported HRQL. Lower proxy-reported HRQL was associated with being female, deprivation and comorbidities, but not age and ethnicity. A large proportion of study participants had moderate or high cognitive function scores, suggesting that these patients were referred early to MAS.

Public attitudes and understanding of dementia in particular may mean that values elicited from the general population may differ from patients and carers for dementia health states. This study examines how the population impacts utility values elicited for dementia health states using interviewer-administered time tradeoff valuation of health states defined by the dementia-specific preference-based measures DEMQOL-U (patient-report) and DEMQOL-Proxy-U (carer-report). Eight DEMQOL-U states were valued by 78 members of the UK general population and 71 patients with dementia of mild severity. Eight DEMQOL-Proxy-U states were valued by 77 members of the UK general population and 71 carers of patients with dementia of mild severity. Random-effects generalized least squares regression estimated the impact of population, dementia health state, and respondent sociodemographic characteristics on elicited values, finding that values for dementia health states differed by population and that the difference varied across dementia health states. Patients with dementia and carers of patients with dementia gave systematically lower values than members of the general population that were not due to differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of the populations. Our results suggest that the population used to produce dementia health state values could impact the results of cost-utility analyses and potentially affect resource allocation decisions; yet,

cannot be used in analyses of cost per quality-adjusted life-year because they do not incorporate preferences. We addressed this gap by estimating two preference-based single index measures: the DEMQOL-U from the self-report DEMQOL (mild-to-moderate dementia severity) and the DEMQOL-Proxy-U from the carer-report DEMQOL-Proxy (all levels of dementia severity).","We conducted valuation studies on 593 members of the general population (306 for the DEMQOL-U, 287 for the DEMQOL-Proxy-U) using the time trade-off elicitation technique. We then fitted a range of mean and individual-level multivariate regression models to the valuation data to derive preference weights for each measure. We applied the estimated weights to a large, clinically representative sample.","Mean observed time trade-off values ranged from 0.18 to 0.95 for DEMQOL-U and from 0.33 to 0.96 for DEMQOL-Proxy-U. The best performing models for each measure were main effects models estimated using individual-level data. DEMQOL-Proxy-U had inconsistent but insignificant coefficient estimates for one dimension. Models were estimated to remove these inconsistencies.","Preference-based single index measures from DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy for use in economic evaluation will enable economic evaluation using quality-adjusted life-years to be undertaken for people across the full range of dementia severity. Future research will examine how the utilities from each measure can be used and combined to populate cost-effectiveness models."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

This requires a means of valuing health states before and after intervention. Although generic measures are typically used to generate values, these do not perform well with people with dementia. We report the development of a health state classification system amenable to valuation for use in studies of dementia, derived from the DEMQOL system, measure of health-related quality of life in dementia by patient self-report (DEMQOL) and carer proxy-report (DEMQOL-Proxy).","Factor analysis was used to determine the dimensional structure of DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy. Rasch analysis was subsequently used to investigate item performance across factors in terms of item-level ordering, functioning across subgroups, model fit, and severity-range coverage. This enabled the selection of one item from each factor for the classification system. A sample of people with a diagnosis of mild\/moderate dementia (n = 644) and a sample of carers of those with mild\/moderate dementia (n = 683) were used.","Factor analysis found different five-factor solutions for DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy. Following item reduction and selection by using Rasch analysis, a five-dimension classification for DEMQOL and a four-dimension classification for DEMQOL-Proxy were developed. Each item contained four health state levels.","Combining Rasch and classical psychometric analysis is a valid method of selecting items for dementia health state classifications from both the patient and carer perspectives. The next stage is to obtain preference weights so that the measure can be used in the economic evaluation of treatment, care, and support arrangements for dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).
