Using LCSM, the model best predicting changes in Geriatric Depression Scale scores was determined based on this data set.","The best fit was achieved by a model predicting a decline in depressive symptoms between before and after testing.

In this study, we evaluated the feasibility, acceptance, efficacy, and usefulness of a CR intervention in a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial on 201 patients with mild dementia in Alzheimer disease and their carers. The intervention comprised 12 individual weekly sessions and combined 4 established strategies adopted from neurorehabilitation and psychotherapy.

However, no effect of the intervention was demonstrable on everyday functioning. There were improvements favoring the intervention on quality of life and treatment satisfaction and a significant antidepressant effect in female participants. The lack of impact on everyday activities may be due to methodological limitations including insufficient personalization, short treatment duration, poor transfer into the real-life setting, and low sensitivity of assessment instruments.

However, it is yet unclear whether this bias reflects an age-related preference for positive emotional stimuli, or an affirmatory bias used to compensate for episodic memory deficits. To follow up this point, the present study examined recognition of emotional faces and current mood state in patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) and healthy controls. Expecting lower overall memory performance, more negative and less positive mood in AD patients, the critical question was whether the positivity-related recognition bias would be increased compared to cognitively unimpaired controls. Eighteen AD patients and 18 healthy controls studied happy, neutral, and angry faces, which in a subsequent recognition task were intermixed with 50% distracter faces. As expected, the patient group showed reduced memory performance, along with a less positive and more negative mood. The recognition bias for positive faces persisted. This pattern supports the view that the positivity-induced recognition bias represents a compensatory, gist-based memory process that is applied when item-based recognition fails.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Cognitive conceptualisation, neural correlates, and diagnostic relevance of impaired memory for faces and names.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"898-906"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Memory for faces and names has increasingly become a focus of cognitive assessment and research in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper reviews evidence from cognitive and clinical neuroscience regarding the question of whether AD is associated with a specific deficit in face recognition, face-name association, and retrieval of semantic information and names. Cognitive approaches conceptualizing face recognition and face-name association have revealed that, compared to other types of visual stimuli, faces are \"special\" because of their complexity and high intraclass similarity, and because their association with proper names is arbitrary and unique. Neuroimaging has revealed that due to this particular status, face perception requires a complex interplay of highly specialized secondary visual areas located in the occipitotemporal cortex with a widely distributed system of cortical areas subserving further task-dependent processing. Our review of clinical research suggests that AD-related deficits in face recognition are primarily due to mnestic rather than perceptual deficits. Memory for previously studied or famous faces is closely related to mediotemporal and temporocortical brain regions subserving episodic and semantic memory in general, suggesting that AD-related impairments in this domain are due to neural degeneration in these areas. Despite limited specificity due to the apparent absence of a \"genuine\" domain-specific deficit of face memory in AD, testing memory for faces and names is useful in clinical contexts, as it provides highly sensitive indices of episodic and semantic memory performance. Therefore, clinical assessment of face memory can usefully contribute to early detection of memory deficits in prodromal and initial stages of AD, and represents a basis for further attempts at rehabilitation. Further advantages, such as ecological validity, high task comprehensibility and, in the case of novel face learning, independence from premorbid intelligence level, render measures of face recognition valuable for clinical assessment in early AD."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Werheid","ForeName":"Katja","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, Humboldt-University at Berlin, Berlin, Germany. katja.werheid@cms.hu-berlin.de"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Italy","MedlineTA":"Cortex","NlmUniqueID":"0100725","ISSNLinking":"0010-9452"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Concept Formation"},{"DescriptorName":"Face"},{"DescriptorName":"Facial Expression"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory Disorders","QualifierName":["complications","diagnosis","physiopathology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Names"},{"DescriptorName":"Recognition, Psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Retention, Psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Verbal Behavior"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"90"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"10","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"6","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"10","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17941348","S0010-9452(08)70689-0","10.1016\/s0010-9452(08)70689-0"]}}}]}
