We used descriptive statistics to report survey findings.","While respondents commonly discussed the progressive nature of dementia with people living with dementia and family carers, they less frequently spoke to people with dementia or carers about the nature of dementia as life shortening, terminal, or a disease you can die from. Admiral Nurses highlighted that where service models reduced continuity of care, opportunities for ongoing discussion and developing relationships that supported these discussions were reduced. Admiral Nurses and care homes raised concerns about conversations being left too late, when the person with dementia no longer had capacity to engage. There was a high level of agreement with all European Association of Palliative Care and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) statements presented regarding end-of-life care planning and discussions.","Our survey of care homes and Admiral Nurses, combined with findings from our previous survey of UK memory services, increases our understanding of how services help people with dementia and family carers prepare for end-of-life. We found fragmentation across the service system, lack of continuity, and tensions regarding when these conversations should be initiated and by whom."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moore","ForeName":"Kirsten J","Initials":"KJ","Identifier":"0000-0002-8631-3213","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Crawley","ForeName":"Sophie","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cooper","ForeName":"Claudia","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0002-2777-7616","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sampson","ForeName":"Elizabeth L","Initials":"EL","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Marie Curie Palliative Care Research Department, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Trust, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harrison-Dening","ForeName":"Karen","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia UK, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2020","Month":"01","Day":"19"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Advance Care Planning"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["mortality","nursing","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Health Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Memory"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse's Role","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Terminal Care","QualifierName":["methods","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"},{"DescriptorName":"Wales"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["admiral nurses","advance care planning","care homes","dementia","family carers","nursing","preparation for end-of-life","progressive","terminal"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2019","Month":"08","Day":"09"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2020","Month":"1","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"11","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2020","Month":"1","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31894598","10.1002\/gps.5256"]},"ReferenceList":{"Title":"REFERENCES","Reference":[{"Citation":"Alzheimer's Disease International.

A multi-method qualitative study with key stakeholders.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"302"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12877-018-0983-0","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["People with advanced dementia often experience suboptimal end of life care (EoLC) with inadequate pain control, increased hospitalisation, and fewer palliative care interventions compared to those with cancer. Existing policy, guidance and recommendations are based largely on expert opinion because of a shortage of high quality, empirical research. Previous studies have tended to consider the views and experience of particular groups. Whilst providing important evidence, they do not take into account the diversity of perspectives of different stakeholders. The Supporting Excellence in End of life care in Dementia (SEED) programme involved multiple stakeholder groups and an integrative analysis to identify key components of good EoLC for people with dementia and to inform a new intervention.","The views of national experts, service managers, frontline staff, people with dementia and family carers were explored using a range of qualitative methods (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, discussions and observations of routine care). The large dataset comprises 116 interviews, 12 focus groups and 256\u2009h of observation. Each dataset was initially analysed thematically prior to an integrative analysis, which drew out key themes across stakeholder groups.","Through the integrative analysis seven key factors required for the delivery of good EoLC for people with dementia were identified: timely planning discussions; recognition of end of life and provision of supportive care; co-ordination of care; effective working relationships with primary care; managing hospitalisation; continuing care after death; and valuing staff and ongoing learning. These factors span the entire illness trajectory from planning at a relatively early stage in the illness to continuing care after death.","This unique study has confirmed the relevance of much of the content of existing end of life frameworks to dementia. It has highlighted seven key areas that are particularly important in dementia care. The data are being used to develop an evidence-based intervention to support professionals to deliver better EoLC in dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bamford","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","Identifier":"0000-0003-2885-801X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

Data were thematically analysed.","Participants comprised people with early stage dementia, living at home in the north-east of England ( n = 11); and current and bereaved carers ( n = 25) from six services providing end-of-life care in England.","Seven areas were identified as important to end-of-life care for people with dementia and\/or family carers. People with dementia and carers expressed the need for receiving care in place, ensuring comfort and a skilled care team. However, they disagreed about the importance of planning for the future and the role of families in organising care and future decision-making.","Further comparison of our findings with expert consensus views highlighted key areas of divergence and agreement. Discordant views concerning perceptions of dementia as a palliative condition, responsibility for future decision-making and the practical co-ordination of end-of-life care may undermine the provision of optimal palliative care.

People with dementia, and their carers, have been shown to have palliative care needs equal in extent to those of cancer patients. However, many people with advanced dementia are not routinely being assessed to determine their palliative care needs, and it is not clear why this is so.","An interdisciplinary workshop on \"Palliative Care in Neurodegeneration, with a focus on Dementia\", was held in Cork, Ireland, in May 2016. The key aim of this workshop was to discuss the evidence base for palliative care for people with dementia, to identify 'gaps' for clinical research, and to make recommendations for interdisciplinary research practice. To lead the discussion throughout the day a multidisciplinary panel of expert speakers were brought together, including both researchers and clinicians from across Ireland and the UK. Targeted invitations were sent to attendees ensuring all key stakeholders were present to contribute to discussions. In total, 49 experts representing 17 different academic and practice settings, attended. Key topics for discussion were pre-selected based on previously identified research priorities (e.g. James Lind Alliance) and stakeholder input. Key discussion topics included: i. Advance Care Planning for people with Dementia; ii. Personhood in End-of-life Dementia care; iii. Topics in the care of advanced dementia at home. These topics were used as a starting point, and the ethos of the workshop was that the attendees could stimulate discussion and debate in any relevant area, not just the key topics, summarised under iv. Other priorities.","The care experienced by people with dementia and their families has the potential to be improved; palliative care frameworks may have much to offer in this endeavour. However, a solid evidence base is required to translate palliative care into practice in the context of dementia. This paper presents suggested research priorities as a starting point to build this evidence base. An interdisciplinary approach to research and priority setting is essential to develop actionable knowledge in this area."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fox","ForeName":"Siobh\u00e1n","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for

This study used the Life Support Preferences Questionnaire (LSPQ) to explore whether family carers' choices show agreement with the end of life care preferences of the person with dementia for whom they care and what factors influence this.","A cross-sectional study interviewing 60 dyads (a person with early dementia and preserved capacity and their family carer) each completing a modified LSPQ. We assessed how closely carers' choices resembled the PWD's preferences for treatment in three proposed health states: the here and now; severe stroke with coma; terminal cancer. Agreement between the PWD and their family carer responses was assessed using Kappa and Prevalence-Adjusted Bias-Adjusted Kappa (PABAK) statistics. We examined whether carer burden and distress, and relationship quality, influenced agreement.","In interviews PWD were able to indicate their treatment preferences across all three scenarios. In the here-and-now most wanted antibiotics (98%), fewer cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (50%) and tube feeding (47%). In severe stroke and coma antibiotics remained the more preferred treatment (88%), followed by CPR (57%) and tube feeding (30%). In advanced cancer PWD expressed lower preferences for all treatments (antibiotics 68%; CPR 50%; tube feeding 37%). Carers' choices were similar to the PWDs' preferences in the here-and-now (71% (k = 0.03; PABAK = 0.4) with less agreement for future hypothetical health states. In severe stroke and coma carers tended wrongly to suggest that the PWD preferred more intervention (antibiotic, 67%; k = -0.022; PABAK = -0.60; CPR, 73%; k = 0.20; PABAK = -0.20, tube feeding, 66%; k = 0.25; PABAK = -0.12). In advanced cancer the agreement between PWD and carers was low (antibiotics; k = -0.03; PABAK = -0.52; CPR, k = -0.07; PABAK = -0.45; tube feeding; k = 0.20; PABAK = -0.22). However, both PWD and carers showed marked uncertainty about their preferences for end of life treatment choices. Relationship quality, carer distress and burden had no influence on agreement.","This study is the first to have used the LSPQ with PWD in the UK to consider treatment options in hypothetical illness scenarios. Key finding are that family carers had a low to moderate agreement with PWD on preferences for end of life treatment. This underscores how planning for care at the end of life is beset with uncertainty, even when the carer and PWD perceive the care-giving\/receiving relationship is good. Families affected by dementia may benefit from early and ongoing practical and emotional support to prepare for potential changes and aid decision making in the context of the realities of care towards the end of life."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harrison
