Randomised controlled trials of occupational therapy delivered at home for people with dementia and their family carers that measured ADL, and\/or BPSD were included. Two independent reviewers determined eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data.","Fifteen trials were included (n=2063). Occupational therapy comprised multiple components (median=8 sessions). Compared with usual care or attention control occupational therapy resulted in improvements in the following outcomes for people with dementia: overall ADL after intervention (standardised means difference (SMD) 0.61, 95%\u2009CI 0.16 to 1.05); instrumental ADL alone (SMD 0.22, 95%\u2009CI 0.07 to 0.37; moderate quality); number of behavioural and psychological symptoms (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.08; moderate quality); and QOL (SMD 0.76, 95%\u2009CI 0.28 to 1.24) after the intervention and at follow-up (SMD 1.07, 95%\u2009CI 0.58 to 1.55). Carers reported less hours assisting the person with dementia (SMD -0.33, 95%\u2009CI -0.58 to -0.07); had less distress with behaviours (SMD -0.23, 95%\u2009CI -0.42 to -0.05; moderate quality) and improved QOL (SMD 0.99, 95%\u2009CI 0.66 to 1.33; moderate quality). Two studies compared occupational therapy with a comparison intervention and found no statistically significant results. GRADE ratings indicated evidence was very low to moderate quality.","Findings suggest that occupational therapy provided at home may improve a range of important outcomes for people with dementia and their family carers.

dementia and their family carers (Community Occupational Therapy in Dementia (COTiD)) was found clinically and cost effective in the Netherlands but not in Germany. This highlights the need to adapt and implement complex interventions to specific national contexts. The current trial aims to evaluate the United Kingdom-adapted occupational therapy intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia and their family carers living in the community (COTiD-UK) compared with treatment as usual.","This study is a multi-centre, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised trial with internal pilot. We aim to allocate 480 pairs, with each pair comprising a person with mild to moderate dementia and a family carer, who provides at least 4 hours of practical support per week, at random between COTiD-UK and treatment as usual. We shall assess participants at baseline, 12 and 26 weeks, and by telephone at 52 and 78 weeks (first 40% of recruits only) after randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) at 26 weeks. Secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, mood, and resource use. To assess intervention delivery, and client experience, we shall collect qualitative data via audio recordings of COTiD-UK sessions and conduct semi-structured interviews with pairs and occupational therapists.","COTiD-UK is an evidence-based person-centred intervention that reflects the current priority to enable people with dementia to remain in their own homes by improving their capabilities whilst reducing carer burden. If COTiD-UK is clinically and cost effective, this has major implications for the future delivery of dementia services across the UK.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN10748953 Date of registration:

occupational therapy program for people with dementia (COTiD program). This strategy was successful in increasing the number of referrals, but not in improving occupational therapists' (OTs) adherence. Therefore, a process evaluation was conducted to identify factors that influenced the effectiveness of the MFI strategy.","A mixed-method approach of qualitative and quantitative research was used to evaluate the implementation process. The MFI strategy as planned and as executed were reported and evaluated based on the framework of Hulscher et al. (2003; 2006). Data on OTs attitudes and expected barriers were collected at baseline from 94 OTs using a 19-item questionnaire. Data on the experiences were collected after finishing the implementation using focus groups with OTs and telephone interviews with physicians and managers. For quantitative data, frequencies and correlations were calculated and qualitative data were analyzed using inductive content analysis.","The implementation strategy as executed had a stronger focus than planned on increasing OTs promotional skills due to an initial lack of referrals. This resulted in less attention for increasing OTs' skills in using the COTiD program as initially intended. At baseline, OTs had a positive attitude toward the program, however, 75% did not feel experienced enough and only 14.3% felt competent in using the program. Focus groups and interviews revealed various determinants that influenced implementation. Most managers were positive about the program. However, the degree of operational support of managers for OTs regarding the implementation was not always adequate. Managers stated that a well-defined place for occupational therapy within the dementia care network was lacking although this was perceived necessary for successful implementation. Several physicians perceived psychosocial interventions not to be in their area of expertise or not their responsibility. All professionals perceived inter-professional collaboration to be a facilitator for effective implementation, and general practitioners were perceived as key partners in this collaboration. However, collaboration was not always optimal. OTs indicated that increasing the referral rate was most effective when promoting OT via other disciplines within a physician's network.","Our data suggests that a first step in successful implementation should be to make sure that individual and organizational barriers are resolved. In addition, implementation should be network-based and encourage inter-professional collaboration. Initial promotion of COTiD should focus on physicians that have a positive attitude toward non-pharmacological interventions."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"D\u00f6pp","ForeName":"Carola M

of a multifaceted implementation strategy on physicians' referral rate to and knowledge on the community occupational therapy in dementia program (COTiD program).","A cluster randomized controlled trial with 28 experimental and 17 control clusters was conducted. Cluster included a minimum of one physician, one manager, and two occupational therapists. In the control group physicians and managers received no interventions and occupational therapists received a postgraduate course. In the experimental group physicians and managers had access to a website, received newsletters, and were approached by telephone. In addition, physicians were offered one outreach visit. In the experimental group occupational therapists received the postgraduate course, training days, outreach visits, regional meetings, and access to a reporting system. Main outcome measure was the number of COTiD referrals received by each cluster which was assessed at 6 and 12\u00a0months after the start of the intervention. Referrals were included from both participating physicians (enrolled in the study and received either the control or experimental intervention) and non-participating physicians (not enrolled but of whom referrals were received by participating occupational therapists). Mixed model analyses were used to analyze the data. All analyses were based on the principle of intention-to-treat.","At 12\u00a0months experimental clusters received significantly more referrals with an average of 5,24 referrals (SD 5,75) to the COTiD program compared to 2,07 referrals in the control group (SD 5,14). The effect size at 12\u00a0months was 0.58. Although no difference in referral rate was found for the physicians participating in the study, the number of referrals from non-participating physicians (t -2,55 \/ 43 \/ 0,02) differed significantly at 12\u00a0months.","Passive dissemination strategies are less likely to result in changes in professional behavior. The amount of physicians exposed to active strategies was limited. In spite of this we found a significant difference in the number of referrals which was accounted for by more referrals of non-participating physicians in the experimental clusters. We hypothesize that the increase in referrals was caused by an increase in occupational therapists' efforts to promote their services within their network.","NCT01117285."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"D\u00f6pp","ForeName":"Carola M

calculated as if an analysis of the outcomes at the end of the treatment period (follow-up scores) would be performed. However, often a baseline measurement of the outcome is available or feasible to obtain. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using both the baseline and follow-up score of the outcome will then have more power. We calculate the efficiency of an ANCOVA analysis using the baseline scores compared with an analysis on follow-up scores only. The sample size for such an ANCOVA analysis is a factor r2 smaller, where r is the correlation of the cluster means between baseline and follow-up. This correlation can be expressed in clinically interpretable parameters: the correlation between baseline and follow-up of subjects (subject autocorrelation) and that of clusters (cluster autocorrelation). Because of this, subject matter knowledge can be used to provide (range of) plausible values for these correlations, when estimates from previous studies are lacking. Depending on how large the subject and cluster autocorrelations are, analysis of covariance can substantially reduce the number of clusters needed.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Teerenstra","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Epidemiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. s.teerenstra@ebh.umcn.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eldridge","ForeName":"Sandra","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Graff","ForeName":"Maud","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Hoop","ForeName":"Esther","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Borm","ForeName":"George F","Initials":"GF"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"04","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Stat Med","NlmUniqueID":"8215016","ISSNLinking":"0277-6715"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cluster Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Occupational Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Sample Size"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2010","Month":"06","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2012","Month":"01","Day":"23"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"4","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"4","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"1","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22495809","10.1002\/sim.5352"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22264496","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2012","Month":"05","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"24","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia: construct and concurrent validity in patients with mild to moderate dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"382-90"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610211001785","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The purpose of the study was to translate the Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia (IDDD) into German and to evaluate the construct and concurrent validity in people with mild to moderate dementia.","IDDD data of two pooled samples (n = 301) were analyzed regarding ceiling and bottom effects, internal consistency, factor reliability and correlations with corresponding scales on cognition and activities of daily living.","We found minimal bottom (< 5%) and ceiling (\u2264 2%) effects, good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 > 0.7) and moderate to good factor reliability (0.66-0.87).

Future controlled trials in daily clinical practice should use a process analysis to control for compliance."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spijker","ForeName":"Anouk","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Scientific Institute for Quality of Healthcare, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen Centre for Evidence Based Practice, Beek-Ubbergen, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wollersheim","ForeName":"Hub","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Teerenstra","ForeName":"Steven","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Graff","ForeName":"Maud","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Adang","ForeName":"Eddy","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Am J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"9309609","ISSNLinking":"1064-7481"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Mental Health Services","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost of Illness"},{"DescriptorName":"Counseling","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Institutionalization","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"3","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"3","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21358385","10.1097\/JGP.0b013e3182110599","S1064-7481(12)60114-6"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19799779","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2010","Month":"05","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2318","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2009","Month":"Oct","Day":"02"}},"Title":"BMC geriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Geriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"WHEDA study: effectiveness of occupational therapy at home for older people with dementia and their caregivers--the design of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial evaluating a Dutch programme in seven German centres.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"44"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1471-2318-9-44","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["A recent Dutch mono-centre randomised controlled trial has shown that occupational therapy improves daily functioning in dementia. The aim of this present study is to compare the effects of the Dutch community occupational therapy programme with a community occupational therapy consultation on daily functioning in older people with mild or moderate dementia and their primary caregivers in a German multi-centre context.","A multi-centre single blind randomised controlled trial design is being used in seven health care centres (neurological, psychiatric and for older people) in urban regions. Patients are 1:1 randomised to treatment or control group. Assessors are blind to group assignment and perform measurements on both groups at baseline, directly after intervention at 6 weeks and at 16, 26 and 52 weeks follow-up. A sample of 140 community dwelling older people (aged >65 years) with mild or moderate dementia and their primary caregivers is planned. The experimental intervention consists of an evidence-based community occupational therapy programme including 10 sessions occupational therapy at home. The control intervention consists of one community occupational therapy consultation based on information material of the Alzheimer Society. Providers of both interventions are occupational therapists experienced in treatment of cognitively impaired older people and trained in both programmes. 'Community' indicates that occupational therapy intervention occurs in the person's own home. The primary outcome is patients' daily functioning assessed with the performance scale of the Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia and video tapes of daily activities rated by external raters blind to group assignment using the Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform System of Task Analysis. Secondary outcomes are patients' and caregivers' quality of life, mood and satisfaction with treatment; the caregiver's sense of competence, caregiver's diary (medication, resource utilisation, time of informal care); and the incidence of long-term institutionalisation. Process evaluation is performed by questionnaires and focus group discussion.","The transfer from the Dutch mono-centre design to the pragmatic multi-site trial in a German context implicates several changes in design issues including differences in recruitment time, training of interventionists and active control group treatment.The study is registered under DRKS00000053 at the German register of clinical trials, which is connected to the International Clinical Trials Registry

challenging aim in healthcare. There is an urgent need for cost-effective support programs that prevent informal caregivers of people with dementia from becoming overburdened, which might result in a delay or decrease of patient institutionalization. For this reason, we have developed the Systematic Care Program for Dementia (SCPD). The SCPD consists of an assessment of caregiver's sense of competence and suggestions on how to deal with competence deficiencies. The efficiency of the SCPD will be evaluated in our study.","In our ongoing, cluster, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial, the participants in six mental health services in four regions of the Netherlands have been randomized per service. Professionals of the ambulatory mental health services (psychologists and social psychiatric nurses) have been randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the control group. The study population consists of community-dwelling people with dementia and their informal caregivers (patient-caregiver dyads) coming into the health service. The dyads have been clustered to the professionals. The primary outcome measure is the patient's admission to a nursing home or home for the elderly at 12 months of follow-up. This measure is the most important variable for estimating cost differences between the intervention group and the control group. The secondary outcome measure is the quality of the patient's and caregiver's lives.","A novelty in the SCPD is the pro-active and systematic approach. The focus on the caregiver's sense of competence is relevant to economical healthcare, since this sense of competence is an important determinant of delay of institutionalization of people with dementia. The SCPD might be able to facilitate this with a relatively small cost investment for caregivers' support, which could result in a major decrease in costs in the management of dementia. Implementation on a national level will be started if the SCPD proves to be efficient.","NCT00147693."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spijker","ForeName":"Anouk","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Scientific
