Patients were assessed with the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly\/CANE.","The majority of diagnoses were depression (33.7%), dementia (24.5%), and schizophrenia (12.7%). The patients' main unmet needs found were psychological distress (15.0%), daytime activities (10.5%), and benefits (6.5%). Patients reported significantly lower unmet and global needs than carers and staff (Z = -8.58, p < 0.001; Z = -11.07, p < 0.001, respectively). A larger number of global needs (met and unmet) were associated with the diagnosis of dementia, followed by schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorder (p < 0.001), with inpatients reporting more needs than outpatients.","Mental disorders were associated with a greater number of needs in elderly patients, which makes this assessment important as it includes the patients' perspective, when they are the focus of intervention, in order to decrease distress and make more beneficial use of services, especially in inpatient settings. These different perspectives are crucial when assessing and planning psychiatric and mental health services."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Passos","ForeName":"Joaquim","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Health Sciences Unit,School of Health Sciences,Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo,Rua D,Mois\u00e9s Alves de Pinho,4900-314,Viana do Castelo,Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fonte","ForeName":"An\u00edbal","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Psychiatric and Mental Health Department,Alto Minho Local Health Unit,Santa Luzia Hospital,Estrada de Santa Luzia,4901-858,Viana do Castelo,Portugal."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dias","ForeName":"Cl\u00e1udia Camila","Initials":"CC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Health Information and Decision Sciences (CIDES) and CINTESIS,Faculty of Medicine,University of Porto,Al.

The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability and validity of a Portuguese version of CANE.","A cross-sectional multicenter study was designed using a convenience sample of elderly mental health services' users. CANE was compared with EASYCare, GHQ12, MMSE, Barthel Index and GDS15 to assess criterion and construct validity. Inter-rater and test-retest reliability were also assessed.","79 patients (76% female), with mean age of 74 (+\/- 6.6) years were included. Most patients lived at home with a family caregiver, generally female. Only 32% had no carer. Dementia was the commonest psychiatric diagnosis (61%) and somatic comorbidity was very prevalent (85%). Kappa values (kappa) for inter-rater item reliability ranged from 0.72 to 1.00 (mean values: 0.96 patient, 0.93 carer, 0.90 staff). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for total scores ranged from 0.95 to 0.98.For test-retest item reliability, the mean kappa value was: 0.80 patient, 0.77 carer, 0.81 staff. ICC for total scores ranged from 0.82 to 0.92. Given the absence of a gold standard, criterion validity was assessed by comparing CANE with EASYCare (rs 0.460; p < or = 0.01), GDS (rs 0.615; p < or = 0.01), GHQ (rs 0.581; p < or = 0.01) and Barthel Index (rs-0.435; p < or = 0.01). Overall, inter-item and item-total correlations for CANE and item comparison with other measures indicated reasonable construct validity.","The psychometric proprieties of CANE seem to be consistently good, in accordance with other studies. Robust results on ecological, face, content, criterion and construct validity, as well as good reliability, were achieved. This version is a promising tool for research and practical use in Portuguese old age settings."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fernandes","ForeName":"Lia","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Psychiatry Service of Hospital S.

Transformation of the health care system will also raise ethical issues inherent to changing roles. The special nature of Alzheimer's patients and the natural course of their disease require special care on the part of physicians to meet the ethical challenges and establish medical goals, in conjunction with their patients and their families. In spite of these rapid advances in biomedical sciences, were not sufficiently developed in the most fitness answers, regarding special moral and ethical attitudes, which must be taken into account, in particular when we try to understand the experience of people with dementia. This article explores emerging issues in relation to awareness in dementia and its impact on legal and ethical matters. The different approaches and principles demonstrated in relation to ethical issues are discussed, with an exploration of the concepts of mental capacity, testamentary capacity, power of attorney, court of protection, advance directives, decision making, participation in research and treatment, informed consent and older people driving. The tensions that exist between the imperatives of doing no harm and of maintaining autonomy in addressing legal and ethical issues are highlighted. The review emphasizes the importance of considering competency and awareness as being multi-faceted, to be understood in the context of social interaction, trying to deal with the challenge of protecting, but not overprotecting, people with dementia. Late stage of dementia is a terminal disease where the goal of the care may not be prolongation of life at all costs, but rather achievement: quality of life, dignity and comfort. In the initial late dementia, quality of life is the target, treating medical problems and psychiatric symptoms. The dignity of people with severe dementia will be preserved, mostly when this influences patient's behaviour, maximizing individual Independence in daily living activities. Finally, comfort is the last and the most important goal of care in late stages of dementia, using appropriate medical strategies and eliminating aggressive interventions (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute care setting, tube feeding and antibiotic treatment). The future work will focus on promoting more evidence-based decision-making on treatment and guidelines for prognostic information. Physician must be knowledgeable about broadly intersecting medical, legal, finance and ethics, underlying the long-term management of dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fernandes","ForeName":"Lia","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Departamento de Psiquiatria, Hospital de S.
