Nursing staff reported clinical events and assessed comfort. The nursing staff or physician assessed the presence of dementia; severity was determined using two highly discriminatory staff-reported instruments.","The sample comprised 401 residents with advanced dementia, 377 with other stages of dementia, and 419 without dementia (N = 1197). Across the three groups, pneumonia occurred in 24 to 27% of residents. Febrile episodes (unrelated to pneumonia) occurred in 39% of residents with advanced dementia, 34% in residents with other stages of dementia and 28% in residents without dementia (P =\u2009.03). Intake problems occurred in 74% of residents with advanced dementia, 55% in residents with other stages of dementia, and 48% in residents without dementia (P <\u2009.001). Overall, these three clinical events were inversely associated with comfort. Less comfort was observed in all resident groups who had pneumonia (advanced dementia, P =\u2009.04; other stages of dementia, P =\u2009.04; without dementia, P <\u2009.001). Among residents with intake problems, less comfort was observed only in those with other stages of dementia (P <\u2009.001) and without dementia (P =\u2009.003), while the presence and severity of dementia moderated this association (P =\u2009.03). Developing \"other clinical events\" was not associated with comfort.","Discomfort was observed in dying residents who developed major clinical events, especially pneumonia, which was not specific to advanced dementia. It is crucial to identify and address the clinical events potentially associated with discomfort in dying residents with and without dementia."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Miranda","ForeName":"Rose","Initials":"R","Identifier":"0000-0001-6580-6548","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"End-of-Life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Ghent University, Brussels, Belgium."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Family Medicine and Chronic Care, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der Steen","ForeName":"Jenny T","Initials":"JT","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam Public Health research institute, Expertise center for Palliative Care, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smets","ForeName":"Tinne","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"End-of-Life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Ghent University, Brussels, Belgium."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Family Medicine and Chronic Care, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van den Noortgate","ForeName":"Nele","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deliens","ForeName":"Luc","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"End-of-Life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and Ghent University, Brussels, Belgium."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Family Medicine and Chronic Care, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium."},{"Affiliation":"Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Payne","ForeName":"Sheila","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"International Observatory on End-of-Life Care, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kyl\u00e4nen","ForeName":"Marika","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Szczerbi\u0144ska","ForeName":"Katarzyna","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Unit for Research on Aging Society, Department of Sociology of Medicine, Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine Chair, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gambassi","ForeName":"Giovanni","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Randomization was stratified by country and median number of beds in each country in a 1:1 ratio.","The PACE Steps to Success Program is a multicomponent intervention to integrate basic nonspecialist palliative care in nursing homes. Using a train-the-trainer approach, an external trainer supports staff in nursing homes to introduce a palliative care approach over the course of 1 year following a 6-steps program. The steps are (1) advance care planning with residents and family, (2) assessment, care planning, and review of needs and problems, (3) coordination of care via monthly multidisciplinary review meetings, (4) delivery of high-quality care focusing on pain and depression, (5) care in the last days of life, and (6) care after death.","The primary resident outcome was comfort in the last week of life measured after death by staff using the End-of-Life in Dementia Scale Comfort Assessment While Dying (EOLD-CAD; range, 14-42).

Representative, internationally comparable data on care home facilities and their residents is needed to monitor health and wellbeing in this population. Identification and collection of data from care homes can be challenging and often underreported. This paper draws on the experiences of the PACE study, a cross sectional mortality follow back study conducted in six European countries.","Multiple challenges were encountered in creating a sampling framework and contacting, recruiting and retaining care homes in the PACE study. Recruiting a randomly identified, representative cohort from a stratified sampling framework was problematic, as was engaging with care homes to ensure high response rates. Variation in the funding of care homes across the six countries involved in the study may explain the additional challenges encountered in England. Awareness of the challenges encountered in England in implementing an international study in care homes can inform the design and implementation of future studies within care homes. Further discussion is needed to determine the barriers and facilitators to conducting research in care homes, and how this is shaped by the focus of the study."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Collingridge

Participants' limited engagement in advance care planning was clarified through several reasons: not considering it useful, hindering patient behaviour, adopting a day-to-day attitude, caregivers emotionally protecting themselves and uncertainty about patients' cognitive competence. However, endorsement for advance care planning showed from respondents' preferences that it should be initiated timely, by a third party, and emphasize patients' remaining capacities. Finally, the need for information and high-quality care emerged.","A gap of knowledge, of information and in care intertwiningly hinder advance care planning. In young-onset dementia, engaging in advance care planning is not an option equally accessible as not doing so.

legalized medical aid in dying (MAID) for competent patients who satisfy strictly defined criteria. The province is considering extending the practice to incompetent patients. We compared the attitudes of four groups of stakeholders toward extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia.","We conducted a province-wide postal survey in random samples of older adults, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, nurses, and physicians caring for patients with dementia. Clinical vignettes featuring a patient with Alzheimer's disease were used to measure the acceptability of extending MAID to incompetent patients with dementia. Vignettes varied according to the stage of the disease (advanced or terminal) and type of request (written or oral only). We used the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach to compare attitudes across groups and vignettes.","Response rates ranged from 25% for physicians to 69% for informal caregivers. In all four groups, the proportion of respondents who felt it was acceptable to extend MAID to an incompetent patient with dementia was highest when the patient was at the terminal stage, showed signs of distress, and had written a MAID request prior to losing capacity. In those circumstances, this proportion ranged from 71% among physicians to 91% among informal caregivers.","We found high support in Quebec for extending the current MAID legislation to incompetent patients with dementia who have reached the terminal stage, appear to be suffering, and had requested MAID in writing while still competent."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons,

dying (MAiD) to incompetent patients and to compare the attitudes of family physicians to those of other medical specialists.","We conducted a postal survey among physicians caring for patients with dementia. We used hypothetical vignettes to elicit their attitudes towards MAiD and continuous deep sedation (CDS) to relieve suffering at end of life. Two patients were depicted in the vignettes: one with cancer eligible for MAiD and one with dementia. The generalized estimating equation approach was used to investigate factors associated with attitudes, including the stage of the illness (advanced vs terminal dementia) and the presence or absence of a prior written request.","A total of 136 physicians out of 653 returned the questionnaire. Physicians favoured CDS over MAiD for relieving suffering in the cancer vignette (93% vs 79%; p\u2009=\u20090.002). In advanced dementia, 45% of physicians supported giving the patient access to MAiD with a written request and 14% without such request. At the terminal stage of dementia, these proportions increased to 71% and 43%, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001), reaching 79% and 52% among family physicians. Support for CDS in terminal dementia was lower than in end-stage cancer (68% vs 93%; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and equal to MAiD with a written request (68% vs 71%; p\u2009=\u20090.623).","Many Quebec physicians support extending MAiD to incompetent patients with dementia to relieve suffering at the terminal stage.

dialogue between an individual, those close to them and their healthcare professionals, concerning the individual's preferences and values concerning future treatment and care, including end-of-life care. Despite universal recognition of the importance of ACP for people with dementia, who gradually lose their ability to make informed decisions themselves, ACP still only happens infrequently, and evidence-based recommendations on when and how to perform this complex process are lacking. We aimed to develop evidence-based clinical recommendations to guide professionals across settings in the practical application of ACP in dementia care.","Following the Belgian Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's procedures, we 1) performed an extensive literature search to identify international guidelines, articles reporting heterogeneous study designs and grey literature, 2) developed recommendations based on the available evidence and expert opinion of the author group, and 3) performed a validation process using written feedback from experts, a survey for end users (healthcare professionals across settings), and two peer-review groups (with geriatricians and general practitioners).","Based on 67 publications and validation from ten experts, 51 end users and two peer-review groups (24 participants) we developed 32 recommendations covering eight domains: initiation of ACP, evaluation of mental capacity, holding ACP conversations, the role and importance of those close to the person with dementia, ACP with people who find it difficult or impossible to communicate verbally, documentation of wishes and preferences, including information transfer, end-of-life decision-making, and preconditions for optimal implementation of ACP. Almost all recommendations received a grading representing low to very low-quality evidence.","No high-quality guidelines are available for ACP in dementia care. By combining evidence with expert and user opinions, we have defined a unique set of recommendations for ACP in people living with dementia.

On December 10, 2015, Quebec became the first Canadian province to give access to medical aid in dying (MAiD) (ie, euthanasia performed by a physician) to competent patients who satisfy strictly defined criteria. Less than 2 years later, Quebec is considering extending MAiD to incompetent patients who made an advance request. With the objective of contributing scientific data to current societal debates, we conducted a survey among 471 informal caregivers of persons with dementia, reached through Alzheimer Societies. We used a series of vignettes featuring a person with Alzheimer disease to investigate respondents' attitudes towards MAiD. The response rate was 69%. Two-thirds [68%; 95% confidence interval, 63%-73%] found it acceptable to extend MAiD to an incompetent patient at an advanced stage of Alzheimer disease who had made a written request while competent, and 91% (95% confidence interval, 87%-94%) found it acceptable at the terminal stage. Self-determination was the most widely endorsed argument in favor of access to MAiD for incompetent patients. Findings suggest strong support among informal caregivers for extending MAiD to incompetent patients, provided they are terminally-ill and had made a written request before losing capacity."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bravo","ForeName":"Gina","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of

mild or severe dementia in general practice in Belgium, Italy and Spain, in terms of place of care, place of death, treatment aims, use of specialized palliative care and communication with general practitioners (GPs).","Cross-sectional retrospective survey was carried out of nationwide networks of GPs in Belgium, Italy and Spain, including patients who died aged 65\u00a0years or older in 2009-2011 and were judged by the GP to have had dementia (n\u00a0=\u00a01623).","GPs reported a higher proportion of older people with severe dementia in Belgium (55%) than in Spain (46\u00a0%) and Italy (45\u00a0%), and a higher proportion of patients living in care homes (57% vs 18% and 13%, respectively). A palliative treatment aim was common in the last 3\u00a0months of life in all three countries. Specialized palliative care services were provided in 14% (Italy, severe dementia) to 38% (Belgium, severe dementia) of cases. Communication between GP and patient about illness-related topics occurred in between 50% (Italy) and 72% (Belgium) of cases of mild dementia, and 10% (Italy) to 32% (Belgium) of cases of severe dementia. Patient preferences for end-of-life care were known in a minority of cases. Few people (13-15\u00a0%) were transferred between care settings in the last week of life.","Although overall treatment aims at the end of life are often aligned with a palliative care approach and transfer rates are low, there is room for improvement in end-of-life care for people with dementia in all countries studied, especially regarding early patient-GP communication.

or lack of comfort in persons unable to communicate. However, pain and (dis)comfort tools have not been compared, and it is unclear to what extent they discriminate between pain and other possible sources of discomfort, or even if items differ.","To map and compare items in tools that assess pain and the broader notion of discomfort or comfort in people with severe dementia or at the end of life.","Using qualitative content analysis with six classifications, we categorized each item of four thoroughly tested observational pain tools (Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia [PAINAD], Pain Assessment Checklist for Seniors with Limited Ability to Communicate [PACSLAC], Doloplus-2, and draft Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition [PAIC]), and four discomfort tools (including distress, comfort, and quality of life in severe dementia or at the end of life; Discomfort Scale-Dementia Alzheimer Type [DS-DAT], Disability Distress Assessment Tool [DisDAT], End-of-Life in Dementia-Comfort Assessment in Dying with Dementia [EOLD-CAD], and Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia [QUALID] scale). We calculated median proportions to compare distributions of categories of pain and discomfort tools.","We found that, despite variable content across tools, items from pain and discomfort tools overlapped considerably. For example, positive elements such as smiling and spiritual items were more often included in discomfort tools but were not unique to these. Pain tools comprised more \"mostly descriptive\" (median 0.63 vs. 0.44) and fewer \"highly subjective\" items (0.06 vs. 0.18); some used time inconsistently, mixing present and past observations.","This analysis may inform a more rigorous theoretical underpinning and (re)development of pain and discomfort tools and calls for empirical testing of a broad item pool for sensitivity and specificity in detecting and discriminating pain from other sources of discomfort."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

We set out to investigate to what extent (1) advance care planning in the form of written advance patient directives and verbal communication with patient and\/or relatives about future care and (2) the existence of written advance general practitioner orders are related to the quality of dying of nursing home residents with dementia.","Cross-sectional study of deaths (2010) using random cluster-sampling. Representative sample of nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium. Deaths of residents with dementia in a three-month period were reported; for each the nurse most involved in care, GP and closest relative completed structured questionnaires.","We identified 101 deaths of residents with dementia in 69 nursing homes (58% response rate). A written advance patient directive was present for 17.5%, GP-orders for 56.7%. Controlling for socio-demographic\/clinical characteristics in multivariate regression analyses, chances of having a higher mean rating of emotional well-being (less fear and anxiety) on the Comfort Assessment in Dying with Dementia scale were three times higher with a written advance patient directive and more specifically when having a do-not-resuscitate order (AOR 3.45; CI,1.1-11) than for those without either (AOR 2.99; CI,1.1-8.3). We found no association between verbal communication or having a GP order and quality of dying.","For nursing home residents with dementia there is a strong association between having a written advance directive and quality of dying. Where wishes are written, relatives report lower levels of emotional distress at the end of life.
