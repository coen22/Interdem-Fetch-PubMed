A process evaluation of the context, the recruitment and target populations reached (residents and nursing staff) and the delivery of the intervention and implementation strategy was carried out to explore the lack of effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA on the residents' prevalence of BPSD.","This study was part of a larger process evaluation using a mixed-methods design. Standardised questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, attendance lists, standardised protocols and written self-reports were used to collect the data. The quantitative data were analysed by calculating descriptive statistics. The qualitative interviews were analysed using deductive content analysis and the self-reports were analysed using a documentary analysis.","None of the NHs had prior experience with dementia-specific case conferences on a specific concept related to BPSD. The number of residents for whom a dementia-specific case conference was held was lower than expected. The number of nursing staff reached was high, although as defined in the study protocol, core nursing teams continuously participating in all components of the intervention were not established throughout the study. An analysis of the delivery of the intervention showed a reduction in the frequency of dementia-specific case conferences and deviations in the process structure and role structure of WELCOME-IdA. The strategy used to facilitate the implementation of WELCOME-IdA was mostly followed. An analysis of the recruitment of residents indicated that the variation in which residents were included in the study sample was high and that the intended sample size required to achieve a power\u2009>80% was not reached.","An analysis of the process evaluation data indicated that there were inaccuracies in the implementation of WELCOME-IdA and there were methodological limitations within the design of the effectiveness trial, both of which could explain the lack of effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA. To optimise the process structure of WELCOME-IdA, an assessment of BPSD and a pre-selection of possible domains for the behavioural analysis could be conducted prior to a dementia-specific case conference.","ISRCTN20203855 .

Finally, the instrument was introduced to 17\u00a0units in 11 nursing homes in a field study (step 5), and 60 care staff members assessed its practicability and feasibility.","The IdA\u00ae used the need-driven dementia-compromised behaviour (NDB) model as a theoretical framework. The literature review and expert-based panel supported the content validity of the IdA\u00ae. At the item level, 77% of the ratings had a CVI greater than or equal to 0.78. The majority of the question-ratings (84%, n\u00a0=\u00a0154) and answer-ratings (69%, n\u00a0=\u00a0122) showed valid results, with none below 0.50. The health care workers confirmed the understandability, completeness and plausibility of the IdA\u00ae. Steps 3 and 4 led to further item clarification. The carers in the study considered the instrument helpful for reflecting challenging behaviour and beneficial for the care of residents with dementia. Negative ratings referred to the time required and the lack of effect on residents\u00b4 behaviour.","There was strong evidence supporting the content validity of the IdA\u00ae. Despite the substantial length and time requirement, the instrument was considered helpful for analysing challenging behaviour. Thus, further research on the psychometric qualities, implementation aspects and effectiveness of the IdA\u00ae in understanding challenging behaviour is needed."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Halek","ForeName":"Margareta","Initials":"M","Identifier":"0000-0001-5368-255X","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Stockumer Str. 12, 58453, Witten, Germany. margareta.halek@dzne.de."},{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany. margareta.halek@dzne.de."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holle","ForeName":"Daniela","Initials":"D","Identifier":"0000-0002-6563-4712","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Stockumer Str. 12, 58453, Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bartholomeyczik","ForeName":"Sabine","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article","Validation Study"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"08","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Health Serv Res","NlmUniqueID":"101088677","ISSNLinking":"1472-6963"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Affective Symptoms","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Consensus"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Feasibility Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Inpatients","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurologic Examination"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Problem Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Challenging behaviour","Content validity index","Dementia","Instrument development","Nursing home","Validity"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"23"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2017","Month":"07","Day":"24"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"3","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28806934","10.1186\/s12913-017-2469-8","10.1186\/s12913-017-2469-8","PMC5557472"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Am J Ment Defic. 1981 Sep;86(2):127-37","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7315877"}},{"Citation":"Br J Clin Psychol. 2001 Sep;40(Pt 3):309-22","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11593958"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2012 Dec;24(12):1891-903","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"22883019"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2015 Feb;71(2):451-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"25338930"}},{"Citation":"Res Nurs Health. 2007 Aug;30(4):459-67","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17654487"}},{"Citation":"J Gerontol Nurs. 2006 Apr;32(4):18-25;

Therefore, informal caregivers, mainly relatives, of people with dementia often feel a high burden. Although on-site support groups are known to have positive effects on the subjective well-being (SWB) and perceived social support of informal caregivers, there are cases in which relatives have either no time or no opportunity to leave the person alone or in which there are no support groups nearby. The TALKING TIME project aims to close this supply gap by providing structured telephone-based support groups in Germany for the first time. International studies have shown benefits for informal caregivers.","The TALKING TIME study is a randomized controlled trial. The effects of the 3-month TALKING TIME intervention will be compared with those of a control group without intervention at two time points (baseline\u2009=\u2009T, after 3\u00a0months\u2009=\u2009T). The control group will receive the TALKING TIME intervention after T. With a planned sample size of 88 participants, the study is powered to detect an estimated effect size of 0.70 for psychological quality of life, considering an \u03b1 of 0.05 (two-sided), a power of 80%. Caregivers are informal caregivers who are eligible if they are 18\u00a0years of age or older and have cared for a person with diagnosed dementia for at least four hours, four days per week, in the past six months. The exclusion criteria are psychiatric disorders of the informal caregiver. The primary outcome is the mental component summary of the SF-12 rated by informal caregivers. The secondary outcomes for informal caregivers are the physical component summary of the SF-12, the Perceived Social Support Caregiver Scale (SSCS) score, and the Caregiver Reaction Scale (CRS) score. The secondary outcome for care recipients is the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q). For the process evaluation, different quantitative and qualitative data sources will be collected to address reach, fidelity, dosage and context.","The results will provide further information on the effectiveness and optimization of telephone-based support groups for informal caregivers of people with dementia, which can help guide the further development of effective telephone-based social support group interventions.","Clinical Trials: NCT02806583 , June 9, 2016."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Berwig","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical Faculty, Leipzig University, Semmelweisstra\u00dfe 10, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.

approach for analyzing and managing challenging behaviors in people with dementia. Little is known about which individualized formulation-led interventions exist and what effects these interventions have on people with dementia and their caregivers. Therefore, the review aims to describe and examine existing interventions and to review their evidence.","An integrative review of individualized formulation-led interventions for managing challenging behavior in people with dementia was conducted. PUBMED, PsycINFO [EBSCO] and CINAHL [EBSCO] databases were searched between February and April 2014 using key terms related to dementia, challenging behavior and individualized formulation- led interventions. The literature search was limited to German and English publications published from 1995. No limitations were placed on the type of paper, type of study design and stage of disease or setting. 37 relevant papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review.","The literature review provided 14 different individualized formulation-led interventions. The effects on people with dementia were diverse, as only half of the studies showed a significant reduction in behaviors compared with the control group.

Various factors influence the implementation of complex interventions such as Dementia Care Mapping; few studies have examined the specific factors influencing Dementia Care Mapping implementation.","A convergent parallel mixed-methods design embedded in a quasi-experimental trial was used to assess Dementia Care Mapping implementation success and influential factors.","From 2011-2013, nine nursing units in nine different nursing homes implemented either Dementia Care Mapping (n\u00a0=\u00a06) or a periodic quality of life measurement using the dementia-specific instrument QUALIDEM (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Diverse data (interviews, n\u00a0=\u00a027; questionnaires, n\u00a0=\u00a0112; resident records, n\u00a0=\u00a081; and process documents) were collected. Each data set was separately analysed and then merged to comprehensively portray the implementation process.","Four nursing units implemented the particular intervention without deviating from the preplanned intervention. Translating Dementia Care Mapping results into practice was challenging. Necessary organisational preconditions for Dementia Care Mapping implementation included well-functioning networks, a dementia-friendly culture and flexible organisational structures. Involved individuals' positive attitudes towards Dementia Care Mapping also facilitated implementation. Precisely planning the intervention and its implementation, recruiting champions who supported Dementia Care Mapping implementation and having well-qualified, experienced project coordinators were essential to the implementation process.","For successful Dementia Care Mapping implementation, it must be embedded in a systematic implementation strategy considering the specific setting. Organisational preconditions may need to be developed before Dementia Care Mapping implementation. Necessary steps may include team building, developing and realising a person-centred care-based mission statement or educating staff regarding general dementia care. The implementation strategy may include attracting and involving individuals on different hierarchical levels in Dementia Care Mapping implementation and supporting staff to translate Dementia Care Mapping results into practice.","The identified facilitating factors can guide Dementia Care Mapping implementation strategy development."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quasdorf","ForeName":"Tina","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.V.

dementia is a major outcome in intervention studies and health care. The Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) is an internationally recommended QoL measurement also available in German language. Until now, only a few results on the psychometric properties of the German QoL-AD were available. Objective: Evaluation of internal consistency and construct validity of the QoL-AD proxy. Method: A principal component analysis (secondary data analysis) of the 13 QoL-AD items was carried out based on the total sample of 234 people with dementia from nine nursing homes in Germany. Subsequently, the internal consistency of the identified factors was examined using Cronbach's alpha. Results: Two factors physical and mental health and social network were determined. Both factors explain 53 % of the total variance. The stability of both factors was validated in two sensitivity analyses. The internal consistency is good for both factors with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88 (physical and mental health) and 0.75 (social network). Conclusion: The QoL-AD proxy allows the assessment of two relevant health-related QoL domains of people with dementia. However, in future studies especially the inter-rater reliability of the QoL-AD proxy has to be examined."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hylla","ForeName":"Jonas","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen (KatHO NRW), Abteilung K\u00f6ln."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schwab","ForeName":"Christian G G","Initials":"CG","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE), Witten."},{"Affiliation":"3 Department f\u00fcr Pflegewissenschaft, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Gesundheit, Universit\u00e4t Witten\/Herdecke (UW\/H), Witten."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Isfort","ForeName":"Michael","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"1 Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen (KatHO NRW), Abteilung K\u00f6ln."},{"Affiliation":"4 Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr angewandte Pflegeforschung (dip), K\u00f6ln."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Halek","ForeName":"Margareta","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE), Witten."},{"Affiliation":"3 Department f\u00fcr Pflegewissenschaft, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Gesundheit, Universit\u00e4t Witten\/Herdecke (UW\/H), Witten."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dichter","ForeName":"Martin N","Initials":"MN","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE), Witten."},{"Affiliation":"3 Department f\u00fcr Pflegewissenschaft, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Gesundheit, Universit\u00e4t Witten\/Herdecke (UW\/H), Witten."}]}]},"Language":"ger","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Validation Study"]},"VernacularTitle":"Interne Konsistenz und Konstrukt-validit\u00e4t des Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) proxy Instruments - eine Sekund\u00e4rdatenanalyse","ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"05","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Switzerland","MedlineTA":"Pflege","NlmUniqueID":"8907069","ISSNLinking":"1012-5302"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living","QualifierName":["classification","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Germany"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Assessment","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Proxy"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":"statistics & numerical data"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Care","QualifierName":["classification","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Demenz","Konstruktvalidit\u00e4t","construct validity","dementia","factorial validity","faktorielle Validit\u00e4t","gesundheitsbezogene Lebensqualit\u00e4t","health related quality of life","internal consistency","interne Konsistenz","nursing home","station\u00e4re Altenpflegeeinrichtung"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"5","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"5","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"1","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27239744","10.1024\/1012-5302\/a000494"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Curated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27052960","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2318","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"16","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Apr","Day":"05"}},"Title":"BMC geriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Geriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"People with dementia in nursing home research: a methodological review of the definition and identification of the study population.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"78"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12877-016-0249-7","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["There are various definitions and diagnostic criteria for dementia, leading to discrepancies in case ascertainment in both clinical practice and research.

The studies' sampling methods were compared with respect to their inclusion criteria, assessment tools and methods used to identify the study population.","We summarized case ascertainment methods from 64 studies. Study participants were identified based on a diagnosis that was evaluated during the study, or a recorded medical dementia diagnosis, or a recorded medical diagnosis either with additional cognitive screenings or using screening tests exclusively. The descriptions of the diagnostics that were applied to assess a diagnosis of dementia were not fully transparent in most of the studies with respect to either a clear reference definition of dementia or applied diagnostic criteria. If reported, various neuropsychological tests were used, mostly without a clear rationale for their selection.","Pragmatic considerations often determine the sampling strategy; they also may explain the variances we detected in the different studies. Variations in sampling methods impede the comparability of study results. There is a need to consent case ascertainment strategies in dementia studies in health service research in nursing homes. These strategies should consider resource constraints and ethical issues that are related to the vulnerable population of nursing home residents. Additionally, reporting about dementia studies in nursing homes need to be improved. If a diagnosis cannot be evaluated based on either ICD or DSM criteria, the study population may not be reported as having dementia. If a diagnosis is evaluated based on ICD or DSM criteria within the study, there is a need for more transparency of the diagnostic

However, no information is available regarding the factor structure of the German version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Nursing Home (NPI-NH). The aim of this study was to evaluate the factor structure (an aspect of construct validity) and internal consistency of the NPI-NH for two different stages of dementia severity in a large German nursing home population.","A total of 784 residents with dementia from 40 nursing homes in three studies was included in a secondary data analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) using an orthogonal rotational procedure (with varimax rotation) was used to evaluate the factor structure of the NPI. Cronbach's \u03b1 was used to assess the stability of the scale.","The factors agitation & restless behavior, psychosis, and mood were identified (with factor loading > 0.4 explaining 50% of the variance). The factors showed a moderate internal consistency of 0.55 and 0.68 (Cronbach's \u03b1).","The results show the acceptable factor structure of the NPI for a German population in nursing homes and confirm the results of studies from other countries.

Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) is a method for implementing PCC. Prior studies have yielded heterogeneous results regarding the effectiveness of DCM for people with dementia (PwD). We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of DCM with regard to quality of life (QoL) and challenging behavior in PwD in nursing homes (NHs).","Leben-QD II is an 18-month, three-armed, pragmatic quasi-experimental trial. The sample of PwD was divided into three groups with three living units per group: (A) DCM applied since 2009, (B) DCM newly introduced during the study, and (C) a control intervention based on a regular and standardized QoL rating. The primary outcome was QoL measured with the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) proxy, and the secondary outcomes were QoL (measured with QUALIDEM) and challenging behavior (measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home version, NPI-NH).","There were no significant differences either between the DCM intervention groups and the control group or between the two DCM intervention groups regarding changes in the primary or secondary outcomes. At baseline, the estimated least square means of the QoL-AD proxy for groups A, B, and C were 32.54 (confidence interval, hereafter CI: 29.36-35.72), 33.62 (CI: 30.55-36.68), and 30.50 (CI: 27.47-33.52), respectively. The DCM groups A (31.32; CI: 28.15-34.48) and B (27.60; CI: 24.51-30.69) exhibited a reduction in QoL values, whereas group C exhibited an increase (32.54; CI: 29.44-35.64) after T2.","DCM exhibited no statistically significant effect in terms of QoL and challenging behavior of PwD in NHs.

These changes can cause significant problems in everyday life for people with bvFTD and their families, and have implications for health and society. Currently, there are no suitable evidence-based specific interventions for people with bvFTD. This scoping review aims to identify the self-expressed needs, demands and coping strategies of people with bvFTD. Identifying these issues is the first step towards the development of need-based psycho-social interventions for people with bvFTD. A comprehensive literature research was conducted of German and English scientific articles published between January 2000 and October 2014 using the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, SocINDEX, GeroLit, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, the German National Library and additional search strategies in terms of a scoping review. Articles were identified by combining search terms related to 'frontotemporal dementia' with terms related to 'self-expressions', 'needs\/demands' and 'coping'. After excluding duplicates, two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of 2317 records for eligibility. Because eligibility could not be assessed from the titles or abstracts of 28 articles, those articles were assessed using the full text. One poster abstract met our research question and a few articles were related, but no article met all of the inclusion criteria. This lack of scientifically based knowledge concerning the perspective of people with bvFTD is discussed with reference to the search strategy and the research questions, disease-related aspects such as changes in behaviour or language and emotions and the difficulties in researching this topic. Recommendations are formulated for future research considering the perspective of people with bvFTD and that will involve the development of appropriate data collection methods. Subsequently, specialised interventions must be developed.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dinand","ForeName":"Claudia","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nover","ForeName":"Sabine Ursula","Initials":"SU","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holle","ForeName":"Daniela","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zischka","ForeName":"Matthias","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Halek","ForeName":"Margareta","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Witten, Research Group: Care Interventions, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Witten, Germany."},{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health, School of Nursing Science, Witten\/Herdecke University, Witten, Germany."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"04","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Frontotemporal Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services Needs and Demand"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["coping","demands","frontotemporal dementia","needs","scoping review","self-expressions"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2015","Month":"02","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"4","Day":"2","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"4","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25827780","10.1111\/hsc.12225"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25496425","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"05","Day":"21"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1745-6215","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Dec","Day":"11"}},"Title":"Trials","ISOAbbreviation":"Trials"},"ArticleTitle":"Process evaluation of the implementation of dementia-specific case conferences in nursing homes (FallDem): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"485"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/1745-6215-15-485","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Challenging behaviors exhibited by individuals with dementia might result from an unmet need that they cannot communicate directly due to cognitive restrictions.

Understanding peoples' behaviors is the basis for the initiation of targeted interventions to improve the quality of care for people with dementia. Furthermore, case conferences demonstrate positive effects on burnout, dementia-specific burden, and vocational action competence of the staff. The two likely approaches for conducting case conferences include the following: A) using a structured assessment instrument, which guides the staff in understanding the residents' behaviors and B) using a narrative approach in which the staff must identify the reasons for the residents' behaviors in an unstructured manner. Case conferences are a complex intervention, and evaluating their multiple effects is challenging. The aim of this study protocol was to describe a likely solution for evaluating this type of complex intervention using a special cluster randomized trial.","In this stepped-wedged cluster randomized trial, the two interventions will be sequentially implemented every three months in a group of 12 nursing homes (clusters) with a minimum of 360 residents over 19\u00a0months (7\u00a0months of intervention for each cluster and follow-up). The primary outcome is the reduction of challenging behavior (measured with the neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home version [NPI-NH]). Secondary outcomes are residents' quality of life, prescription of psychotropic medications, staff burnout, dementia-related stress, and vocational action competence. The effectiveness of the study will be accompanied by a process evaluation. The primary data will be analyzed using a Bayesian mixed effect model; the secondary data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and mixed effects models.","The implementation and effect measurement of complex interventions such as case conferences within a cluster randomized trial are challenging (e.g., complex and intensive training, delayed treatment effect). In this study protocol, the methodological advantages and disadvantages of using the stepped wedge design to answer the research questions are discussed.","http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/ISRCTN20203855; registered 10 July

promotion of quality of life (Qol). Most of the residents in nursing homes have challenging behaviors that strongly affect their Qol. Person-centered care (PCC) is an approach that aims to achieve the best possible Qol and to reduce challenging behaviors. Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) is a method of implementing PCC that has been used in Germany for several years. However, there are no data on the effectiveness of DCM or the challenges of implementation of DCM in German nursing homes.","In this quasi-experimental non-randomized cluster-controlled study, the effects of DCM will be compared to 2 comparison groups. 9 nursing homes will take part: 3 will implement DCM, 3 will implement a comparison intervention using an alternative Qol assessment, and 3 have already implemented DCM. The main effect outcomes are Qol, challenging behaviors, staff attitudes toward dementia, job satisfaction and burnout of caregivers. These outcomes will be measured on 3 data points. Different quantitative and qualitative data sources will be collected through the course of the study to investigate the degree of implementation as well as facilitators of and barriers to the implementation process.","This study will provide new information about the effectiveness of DCM and the implementation process of DCM in German nursing homes. The study results will provide important information to guide the national discussion about the improvement of dementia-specific Qol, quality of care in nursing homes and allocation of resources. In addition, the study results will provide information for decision-making and implementation of complex psychosocial interventions such as DCM. The findings will also be important for the design of a subsequent randomized controlled trial (e.g. appropriateness of outcomes and measurements, inclusion criteria for participating nursing homes) and the development of a successful implementation strategy.","Current Controlled Trials

encountered when caring for people with dementia in nursing homes. In this context, a case conference is often recommended for healthcare professionals as an effective instrument to improve the quality of care. However, the subject case conference has not had great consideration in scientific literature. The aim of this review is to describe the effects of case conferences on people with dementia and challenging behavior and the staff in nursing homes.","A search of intervention studies in nursing homes in the German or English language was performed in the following databases: Medline, Cinahl, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Embase, and Google Scholar. The selection and the methodological quality of the studies were assessed independently by two authors. The results were summarized and compared based on categories such as study quality or outcomes.","Seven of 432 studies were included in the review. A total of four of seven studies showed a reduction in the challenging behavior of people with dementia, and five showed an influence on the competence, attitudes, and job satisfaction of the staff. However, due to the middle-range quality of several studies, the methodological heterogeneity and differences in the interventions, the results must be interpreted with caution.","In summary, little evidence exists for the positive effects of case conferences in the care of people with dementia.

We urgently need innovative future-oriented concepts of evidence-based health care which would improve the care for people with dementia, even under adverse circumstances. The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Witten is willing to meet this challenge.","the DZNE in Witten supports interdisciplinary research and houses three scientific work groups acting in close co-operation and focusing on 1) care structures, 2) care interventions, and 3) knowledge circulation and implementation research. A comprehensive project plan focuses on people with dementia's perspective in the early stages of the disease. It intends to investigate their needs, requirements und activities as a basis for the development of appropriate concepts. Apart from specific research questions methodological issues arising from the complexity of the subject are of interest.","the institutional funding of the location offers an unparalleled opportunity to plan long-term and more complex projects. This might lead to a close co-operation with the Witten\/Herdecke University, where health care research is of particular relevance."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bartholomeyczik","ForeName":"Sabine","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.V.
