Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) is perceived to be valuable in dementia care and promising in ID-care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the process of the first use of DCM in ID-care.","DCM was used among older people with ID and care-staff in 12 group homes of six organisations. We obtained data on the first use of DCM in ID-care via focus-group discussions and face-to-face interviews with: care-staff (N = 24), managers (N = 10), behavioural specialists (N = 7), DCM-ID mappers (N = 12), and DCM-trainers (N = 2). We used the RE-AIM framework for a thematic process-analysis.","All available staff (94%) participated in DCM (reach). Regarding its efficacy, staff considered DCM valuable; it provided them new knowledge and skills. Participants intended to adopt DCM, by continuing and expanding its use in their organisations. DCM was implemented as intended, and strictly monitored and supported by DCM-trainers. As for maintenance, DCM was further tailored to ID-care and a version for individual ID-care settings was developed, both as standards for international use. To sustain the use of DCM in ID-care, a multidisciplinary, interorganisational learning network was established.","DCM tailored to ID-care proved to be an appropriate and valuable method to support staff in their work with aging clients, and it allows for further implementation. This is a first step to obtain an evidence-based method in ID-care for older clients."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schaap","ForeName":"Feija D","Initials":"FD","Identifier":"0000-0001-6719-6982","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Research Group Living, Wellbeing and Care for Older People , NHL University of Applied Sciences , Leeuwarden , The Netherlands."},{"Affiliation":"c Department of Health Sciences, Community & Occupational Medicine , University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dijkstra","ForeName":"Geke J","Initials":"GJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Department of Health Sciences, Applied Health Research , University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Finnema","ForeName":"Evelyn J","Initials":"EJ","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Research Group Living, Wellbeing and Care for Older People , NHL University of Applied Sciences , Leeuwarden , The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Reijneveld","ForeName":"Sijmen A","Initials":"SA","Identifier":"0000-0002-1206-7523","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"c Department of Health Sciences, Community & Occupational Medicine , University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen , Groningen , The Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"24"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","nursing","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Intellectual Disability","QualifierName":["complications","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia care mapping","RE-AIM model","dementia","evidence-based methods","intellectual disability"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29171286","10.1080\/13607863.2017.1401582"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15799079","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"08","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2006","Month":"11","Day":"15"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"The effect of integrated emotion-oriented care versus usual care on elderly persons with dementia in the nursing home and on nursing assistants: a randomized clinical trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"330-43"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To examine the effect of integrated emotion-oriented care on nursing home residents with dementia and nursing assistants.","A multi-site randomized clinical trial with matched groups, and measurements at baseline and after seven months.","Sixteen psychogeriatric wards in fourteen nursing homes in the Netherlands.","One hundred and forty-six elderly residents with the diagnosis dementia of the Alzheimer (DAT) type, mixed DAT and vascular dementia, and dementia syndrome (NAO) and 99 nursing assistants.","Integrated emotion-oriented care and usual care.
