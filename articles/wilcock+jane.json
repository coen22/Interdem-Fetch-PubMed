Anti-psychotics are used to treat such behaviour, but are associated with significant morbidity. This study researched the feasibility of conducting a trial of a full clinical medication review for care home residents with behaviour that challenges, combined with staff training. This paper focusses on the feasibility of measuring clinical outcomes and intervention costs.","People living with moderate to severe dementia, receiving psychotropics for behaviour that challenges, in care homes were recruited for a medication review by a specialist pharmacist. Care home and primary care staff received training on the management of challenging behaviour. Data were collected at 8\u2009weeks, and 3 and 6\u2009months. Measures were Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH), cognition (sMMSE), quality of life (EQ-5D-5\u2009L\/DEMQoL) and costs (Client Services Receipt Inventory). Response rates, for clinical, quality of life and health economic measures, including the levels of resource-use associated with the medication review and other non-intervention costs were calculated.","Twenty-nine of 34 participants recruited received a medication review. It was feasible to measure the effects of the complex intervention on the management of behaviour that challenges with the NPI-NH. There was valid NPI-NH data at each time point (response rate\u2009=\u2009100%). The sMMSE response rate was 18.2%. Levels of resource-use associated with the medication review were estimated for all 29 participants who received a medication review. Good response levels were achieved for other non-intervention costs (100% completion rate), and the EQ-5D-5\u2009L and DEMQoL (\u226588% at each of the time points where data was collected).","It is feasible to measure the clinical and cost effectiveness of a complex intervention for behaviour that challenges using the NPI-NH and quality of life measures.","ISRCTN58330068.

of challenges and difficult decisions for practitioners. These challenges may include assessment and management of difficulties with eating and swallowing, responding to agitation, treating pain, and managing recurrent infections. Practitioners sometimes lack both confidence in making end of life decisions and guidance. This study developed an alternative to lengthy guidelines, in the form of heuristics which were tested in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to test the usability and acceptability of a set of heuristics which could be used by practitioners providing EOLC for people with dementia in a variety of clinical and care settings.","A three phase co-design process was adopted: 1) Synthesis of evidence and outputs from interviews and focus groups with family carers and practitioners, by a co-design group, to develop heuristics; 2) Testing of the heuristics in five clinical or care settings for six months; 3) Evaluation of the heuristics at three and six months using qualitative individual and group interviews.","Four heuristics were developed covering: eating and swallowing difficulties, agitation and restlessness, reviewing treatment and interventions at the end of life, and providing routine care. The five sites reported that the heuristics were simple and easy to use, comprehensive, and made implicit, tacit knowledge explicit. Four themes emerged from the qualitative evaluation: authority and permission; synthesis of best practice; providing a structure and breaking down complexity; and reassurance and instilling confidence.","Use of heuristics is a novel approach to end of life decision making in dementia which can be useful to both experienced and junior members of staff making decisions. Heuristics are a practical tool which could overcome a lack of care pathways and direct guidance in end of life care for people with

dementia, resident in care homes and historically has been treated with anti-psychotics. However, such usage is associated with 1800 potentially avoidable deaths annually in the UK. This study investigated the feasibility of a full clinical trial of a specialist dementia care pharmacist medication review combined with a health psychology intervention for care staff to limit the use of psychotropics. This paper focuses on feasibility; including recruitment and retention, implementation of medication change recommendations and the experiences and expectations of care staff.","West Midlands care homes and individuals meeting the inclusion criteria (dementia diagnosis; medication for behaviour that challenges), or their personal consultee, were approached for consent. A specialist pharmacist reviewed medication. Care home staff received an educational behaviour change intervention in a three-hour session promoting person-centred care. Primary healthcare staff received a modified version of the training. The primary outcome measure was the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version at 3\u00a0months. Other outcomes included quality of life, cognition, health economics and prescribed medication. A qualitative evaluation explored expectations and experiences of care staff.","Five care homes and 34 of 108 eligible residents (31.5%) were recruited, against an original target of 45 residents across 6 care homes. Medication reviews were conducted for 29 study participants (85.3%) and the pharmacist recommended stopping or reviewing medication in 21 cases (72.4%). Of the recommendations made, 57.1% (12 of 21) were implemented, and implementation (discontinuation) took a mean of 98.4\u00a0days. In total, 164 care staff received training and 21 were interviewed. Care staff reported a positive experience of the intervention and post intervention adopting a more holistic patient-centred approach.","The intervention contained two elements; staff training and medication review. It was feasible to implement the staff training, and the training appeared to increase the ability and confidence of care staff to manage behaviour that challenges without the need for medication. The medication review would require significant modification for full trial partly related to the relatively limited uptake of the recommendations made, and delay in implementation.","ISRCTN58330068 .

person-centred care for people with dementia by connecting together fragmented services, but the available evidence in favour of its merits is often considered inconclusive, unclear and sketchy. This discussion paper investigates the evidence of the benefit of case management for people with dementia and explores the complexity of the concept and the experiences of its implementation. It offers a comprehensive framework for conceptualising various types of case management and asks the question: who can be a case manager? Building on examples from three European countries it addresses the problem of the expansion and adoption of the case management method. It compares the conventional model of diffusion of innovation with the ideas of interessement and co-constitution and envisions a successful model of case management as a fluid technology that is both friendly and flexible, allowing it to adapt to different settings and systems."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Synek","ForeName":"Michal","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Czech Republic."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carboch","ForeName":"Radek","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Czech Republic."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hradcov\u00e1","ForeName":"Dana","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holmerov\u00e1","ForeName":"Iva","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"03","Day":"17"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Case Management","QualifierName":"economics"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Diffusion of Innovation"},{"DescriptorName":"Efficiency, Organizational"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["case management","dementia","fluid technology","interessement","translation of case management"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29149792","10.1177\/1471301217697802"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28640487","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"04","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1369-7625","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02"}},"Title":"Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Expect"},"ArticleTitle":"A qualitative study exploring the difficulties influencing decision making at the end of life for people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"118-127"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/hex.12593","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by declining functional and cognitive abilities.

Each topic became a heuristic consisting of rules arranged into flowcharts. Eating\/swallowing difficulties have three rules; ensuring eating\/swallowing difficulties do not come as a surprise, considering if the situation is an emergency, and considering 'comfort feeding' only versus time-trialled artificial feeding. Agitation\/restlessness encourages a holistic approach, considering the environment, physical causes, and the carer's wellbeing. Ending life-sustaining treatment supports practitioners through a process of considering the benefits of treatment versus quality-of-life and comfort. Finally, a heuristic on providing routine care such as bathing, prompts practitioners to consider adapting the delivery of care, in order to promote comfort and dignity at the end of life.","The heuristics are easy to use and remember, offering a novel approach to decision making for dementia end-of-life care. They have the potential to be used alongside existing end-of-life care recommendations, adding more readily available practical assistance. This is the first study to synthesise experience and existing evidence into easy-to-use heuristics for dementia end-of-life care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Nathan","Initials":"N","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7757-5353","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK.

feasibility study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e010279"},"ELocationID":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-010279","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The inappropriate use of antipsychotics in people with dementia for behaviour that challenges is associated with an estimated 1800 deaths annually. However, solely focusing on antipsychotics may transfer prescribing to other equally dangerous psychotropics. Little is known about the role of pharmacists in the management of psychotropics used to treat behaviours that challenge. This research aims to determine whether it is feasible to implement and measure the effectiveness of a combined pharmacy-health psychology intervention incorporating a medication review and staff training package to limit the prescription of psychotropics to manage behaviour that challenges in care home residents with dementia.","6 care homes within the West Midlands will be recruited. People with dementia receiving medication for behaviour that challenges, or their personal consultee, will be approached regarding participation. Medication used to treat behaviour that challenges will be reviewed by the pharmacist, in collaboration with the general practitioner (GP), person with dementia and carer. The behavioural intervention consists of a training package for care home staff and GPs promoting person-centred care and treating behaviours that challenge as an expression of unmet need. The primary outcome measure is the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). Other outcomes include quality of life (EQ-5D and DEMQoL), cognition (sMMSE), health economic (CSRI) and prescribed medication including whether recommendations were implemented. Outcome data will be collected at 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Pretraining and post-training interviews will explore stakeholders' expectations and experiences of the intervention. Data will be used to estimate the sample size for a definitive study.","The project has received a favourable opinion from the East Midlands REC (15\/EM\/3014). If potential participants lack capacity, a personal consultee will be consulted regarding participation in line with the Mental Capacity Act. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

behaviour for people with dementia using interviews with 84 carers recruited through general practice. Memory loss was the most commonly reported first symptom but psychological and behavioural symptoms were also common at onset. In over a third of individuals help-seeking was delayed for a mean of 25 months (range 6-69, SD 19.3). Help-seeking between those who attributed symptoms to dementia, or to unknown causes, and those who attributed symptoms to personality, ageing, life events or other illnesses was statistically significant ( p\u2009<\u20090.001). No statistically significant associations between help-seeking and patient or carer characteristics were found.

The primary outcome measure was an increase in the proportion of patients with dementia who received at least two documented dementia-specific management reviews per year. Case identification was a secondary outcome measure.","23 practices in South-East England participated. A total of 1,072 patients with dementia (intervention: 512, control: 560) had information in their medical records showing the number of reviews within 12 months (or a proportion of) before intervention or randomization and within 12 months (or a proportion of) after. The mean total number of dementia management reviews after the educational intervention for people with dementia was 0.89 (SD 1.09; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 8) compared with 0.89 (SD 0.92; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 4) before intervention. In the control group prior to randomization the mean total number of dementia management reviews was 1.66 (SD 1.87; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 12) and in the period after randomization it was 1.56 (SD 1.79; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 11).

Earlier recognition of and response to dementia syndrome is likely to enhance the quality of life of people with dementia, but general practitioners consistently report limited skills and confidence in diagnosis and management of this condition. Changing clinical practice is difficult, and the challenge for those seeking change it is to find ways of working with the grain of professional knowledge and practice. Assessment of educational needs in a practice has the potential to accommodate variations in individual understanding and competence, learning preferences and skill mix. Educational prescriptions identify questions that need to be answered in order to address a clinical problem. This paper reports the development of an educational needs assessment tool to guide tailored educational interventions designed to enhance early diagnosis and management of dementia in primary care, in the Evidence Based Interventions in Dementia in the Community - Early Diagnosis trial.","A multidisciplinary team, including a lay researcher, used an iterative technology development approach to create an educational needs assessment tool, from which educational prescriptions could be written. Workplace learning was tailored to each practice using the educational prescription, and the method was field-tested in five pilot practices.","The educational prescriptions appeared acceptable and useful in volunteer practices. The time commitment (no more than four hours, spread out at the practice's discretion) appeared manageable. The pilot group of practices prioritised diagnosis, assessment of carers' needs, quality markers for dementia care in general practice, and the implications of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) for their clinical practice. The content of the educational needs assessment tool seemed to be comprehensive, in that no new topics were identified by practices in the field trial.","The educational needs assessment tool took into account practitioners' knowledge of the local health and social care systems, reflected the complexity of the diagnostic and care processes for people with dementia, and acknowledged the complexity of the disease process itself."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL, Rowland Hill Street, London NW3 2PF, UK. s.iliffe@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koch","ForeName":"Tamar","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jain","ForeName":"Priya","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lefford","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wong","ForeName":"Geoffrey","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Warner","ForeName":"Alex","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"IPF 11-13","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1005","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"08","Day":"22"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Trials","NlmUniqueID":"101263253","ISSNLinking":"1745-6215"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Health Services","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Medical, Continuing","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Evidence-Based Medicine","QualifierName":["education","methods"]},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Assessment","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Needs Assessment"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care Team","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2012","Month":"08","Day":"03"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"4","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22913431","1745-6215-13-142","10.1186\/1745-6215-13-142","PMC3492020"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2001 Nov;5(4):340-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11767982"}},{"Citation":"J Fam Pract. 2001 Oct;50(10):872-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11674890"}},{"Citation":"JAMA. 2003 Apr 16;289(15):1969-75","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12697800"}},{"Citation":"Ann Intern Med. 2003 Jun 3;138(11):927-37","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12779304"}},{"Citation":"Lancet. 2003 Oct 11;362(9391):1225-30","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14568747"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2004 Feb;19(2):151-69","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14758581"}},{"Citation":"Neurol Sci. 2004 Feb;24(6):384-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14767683"}},{"Citation":"Med J Aust. 2004 Mar 15;180(6 Suppl):S57-60","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15012583"}},{"Citation":"J Healthc Manag. 2004 May-Jun;49(3):155-68;

CONSTRUCTION & CONTENTS: A technology development methodology was used to develop a registry of people with dementia and their carers. This involved phases of modelling and prototype creation, 'bench testing' the prototype with experts and then 'field testing' the refined prototype in exemplar sites. The evaluation of the field testing described here is based on a case study methodology. UTILITY: This case study suggests that construction and population of a dementia research registry is feasible, but initial development is complex because of the ethical and organisational difficulties. Recruitment from primary care is particularly costly in terms of staff time and only identifies a very small number of people with dementia who were not already known to specialist services. Recruiting people with dementia through secondary care is a resource intensive process that takes up to six months to complete. Identifying the components of a minimum dataset was easy but its usefulness for pre-screening potential research populations has yet to be established. Acceptance rates are very high in the first clinic to recruit to the registry, but this may reflect the efforts of registry 'champions'.","Easier recruitment may perpetuate potential selection biases and we are not yet able to assess the representativeness of the research-ready population recruited to the registry. The need to recruit from wider populations, through primary and social care, remains. The success of this registry will be measured by the proportion of people from it who are recruited to research projects, and its impact on overall accrual to studies."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research

and management skills in dementia. Early diagnosis in dementia within primary care is important as this allows those with dementia and their family care networks to engage with support services and plan for the future. There is, however, evidence that dementia remains under-detected and sub-optimally managed in general practice. An earlier unblinded, cluster randomised controlled study tested the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving detection rates and management of dementia in primary care. In this original trial, a computer decision support system and practice-based educational workshops were effective in improving rates of detecting dementia although not in changing clinical management. The challenge therefore is to find methods of changing clinical management. Our aim in this new trial is to test a customised educational intervention developed for general practice, promoting both earlier diagnosis and concordance with management guidelines.","The customised educational intervention combines practice-based workshops and electronic support material. Its effectiveness will be tested in an unblinded cluster randomised controlled trial with a pre-post intervention design, with two arms; normal care versus the educational intervention. Twenty primary care practices have been recruited with the aim of gaining 200 patient participants. We will examine whether the intervention is effective, pragmatic and feasible within the primary care setting. Our primary outcome measure is an increase in the proportion of patients with dementia who receive at least two dementia-specific management reviews per year. We will also examine important secondary outcomes such as practice concordance with management guidelines and benefits to patients and carers in terms of quality of life and carer strain.","The EVIDEM-ED trial builds on the earlier study but the intervention is different in that it is specifically customised to the educational needs of each practice. If this trial is successful it could have implications for the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy.","NCT00866099."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research

April 2004. Shared care of medical treatment in dementia depends upon early diagnosis, but under-recognition of and under-response to dementia appear widespread in general practice.","To investigate the perceptions of specialists and generalists about the potential for shared care of people with dementia.","Qualitative study with semistructured interviews.","Three inner-city and two rural areas.","Semistructured interviews were arranged at the participants' convenience and were tape-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis of the anonymized transcripts was undertaken and a case and cross-case analysis was performed.","Thirty-nine GPs and 30 specialists were interviewed. Broad themes were reduced to following four key categories which appear to be layered over each other: therapeutic nihilism; risk reduction or avoidance; concerns about competency; and resources for shared care.","Roles for primary and secondary care professionals are inappropriately distributed and require clearer definition. Resistance to shared care mostly comes from within general practice and reflects concerns about staffing, time constraints, lack of experience and confidence in making and disclosing a diagnosis. Developers of shared care protocols must dissect layered obstacles, addressing the issues of therapeutic nihilism, risk management and clinical competence."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Ageing Population Studies, Department of Primary Care & Population Sciences, Royal Free & UCL Medical School, London, UK. s.iliffe@pcps.ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Haworth","ForeName":"Deborah","Initials":"D"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2006","Month":"02","Day":"03"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Fam Pract","NlmUniqueID":"8500875","ISSNLinking":"0263-2136"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Anecdotes as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication Barriers"},{"DescriptorName":"Cooperative Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Referral and Consultation"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"2","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"12","Day":"9","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"2","Day":"8","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16461450","cmi116","10.1093\/fampra\/cmi116"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15271637","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"02","Day":"02"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0002-0729","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"33","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2004","Month":"Sep"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"General practitioners' knowledge, confidence and attitudes in the diagnosis and management of dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"461-7"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To measure general practitioners' knowledge of, confidence with and attitudes to the diagnosis and management of dementia in primary care.","20 general practices of varying size and prior research experience in Central Scotland, and 16 similarly varied practices in north London.","127 general practitioners who had volunteered to join a randomised controlled trial of educational interventions about dementia diagnosis and management.","Self-completion questionnaires covering knowledge, confidence and attitudes were retrieved from practitioners prior to the educational interventions.","General practitioners' knowledge of dementia diagnosis and management is good, but poor awareness of its epidemiology leads to an over-estimate of caseload. Knowledge of local diagnostic and support services is less good, and one third of general practitioners expressed limited confidence in their diagnostic skills, whilst two-thirds lacked confidence in management of behaviour and other problems in dementia. The main difficulties identified by general practitioners were talking with patients about the diagnosis, responding to behaviour problems and coordinating support services. General practitioners perceived lack of time and lack of social services support as the major obstacles to good quality care more often than they identified their own unfamiliarity with current management or with local resources. Attitudes to the disclosure of the diagnosis, and to the potential for improving the quality of life of patients and carers varied, but a third of general practitioners believed that dementia care is within a specialist's domain, not that of general practice. More experienced and male general practitioners were more pessimistic about dementia care, as were general practitioners with lower knowledge about dementia. Those reporting greater difficulty with dementia diagnosis and management and those with lower knowledge scores were also less likely to express attitudes endorsing open communication with patient and carer.","Educational support for general practitioners should concentrate on epidemiological knowledge, disclosure of the diagnosis and management of behaviour problems in dementia.

The focus of the article is the knowledge, attitudes and confidence of primary care nursing staff to the diagnosis and ongoing management of dementia. A total 78 nurses with a mean age of 46.4 years and a mean time since qualification of 23.0 years were recruited in 36 practices in central Scotland and in London. Disciplines represented by this sample were predominantly district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses and community staff nurses. Each practitioner was administered an extensive self-completion questionnaire before the educational interventions were introduced to measure baseline knowledge, confidence and perceived difficulties in dementia care management and attitudes. Results from the quiz indicate lower levels of knowledge about epidemiology and diagnosis, but slightly higher levels about management strategies. Self-reported ratings of confidence were also low and were directly related to ratings of difficulty in identifying dementia and dealing with coexisting behavioural and mental health problems. Lower scores on all domains were recorded for practice nurses than for district nurses or health visitors."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bryans","ForeName":"Michelle","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Turner","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Clinical Trial","Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Br J Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9212059","ISSNLinking":"0966-0461"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse's Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Education Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Staff","QualifierName":["education","psychology","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2003","Month":"07","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"2","Day":"5","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["14512859","10.12968\/bjon.2003.12.17.11723"]}}}]}
