Predisposing, enabling, and need variables were investigated to find out whether there is equitable access to dementia-specific formal care services. Results can identify which specific factors should be a target to improve access.","A total of 451 People with middle-stage dementia and their informal carers from eight European countries were included. At baseline, there was no use of formal care yet, but people were expected to start using formal care within the next year. Logistic regressions were carried out with one of four clusters of service use as dependent variables (home social care, home personal care, day care, admission). The independent variables (predisposing, enabling, and need variables) were added to the regression in blocks.","The most significant predictors for the different care clusters are disease severity, a higher sum of (un)met needs, hours spent on informal care, living alone, age, region of residence, and gender.","The Andersen model provided for this cohort the insight that (besides need factors) the predisposing variables region of residence, gender, and age do play a role in finding access to care. In addition, it showed us that the numbers of hours spent on informal care, living alone, needs, and disease severity are also important predictors within the model's framework. Health care professionals should pay attention to these predisposing factors to ensure that they do not become barriers for those in need for care."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

healthcare budgets remains high, partially due to the ageing population. Economic evaluation can be a helpful tool to inform resource allocation in publicly financed systems. Such evaluations frequently use health-related outcome measures. However, in areas such as care of older people, improving health outcomes is not necessarily the main focus of care interventions and broader outcome measures, including outcomes for those providing informal care, may be preferred when evaluating such interventions. This paper validates a recently introduced well-being measure, the ICECAP-O, in a population of informal carers for people with dementia from eight European countries.","Convergent and discriminant validity tests were performed to validate the ICECAP-O using data obtained in a sample of 451 respondents from Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. These respondents completed a number of standardized questionnaires within the framework of the Actifcare project.","The ICECAP-O performed well among informal carers, in terms of both convergent and discriminant validity. In the multivariate analysis, it was found to be significantly associated with the age of the person with dementia, EQ-5D-5L health problem index of the person with dementia, carer-patient relationship, care recipient CDR, carer LSNS Score, the PAI score, and Perseverance Time.","The ICECAP-O appears to be a valid measure of well-being in informal carers for people with dementia. The ICECAP-O may therefore be useful as an outcome measure in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at such informal carers, when these aim to improve well-being beyond health."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Perry-Duxbury","ForeName":"Meg","Initials":"M","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5293-2457","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Erasmus

manner, or in some cases, at all. Although carers' perspectives on respite access have been explored, other stakeholder perspectives, especially providers and people with dementia, are underrepresented in the existing literature. The aim of this study was to synthesize multiple stakeholders' perspectives, including people with dementia, on accessing respite services in the context of dementia.","Purposive maximum variation sampling was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 35 key stakeholders, including people with dementia (n = 6), carers (n = 9), respite frontline staff (n = 4), respite managers (n = 8), primary care professionals (n = 3), and policy-makers\/academics (n = 5). The process of consent is outlined. Data were interpreted inductively using thematic analysis. Reflexivity was considered throughout the research process.","Three themes (\"Service Acceptability,\" \"Navigational Knowledge and Skills,\" \"Constructing and Adjudicating Respite Need\") were identified that relate to how access to respite services is negotiated between service providers and dyads.","A number of the findings support previous research; however, novel findings discussed relating to the access negotiation process include (a) the ambiguous legitimacy of respite needs, in a system configured to deliver a biomedical model of care and which considers nonmedical care as a family responsibility, and (b) the constraining effects of disparate conceptualizations of \"respite\" between carers and providers.

A total of 85 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted in eight European countries. Results were analysed with a deductive content analysis, first within country and then integrated in a cross-national analysis. Overall, analysis of the in-depth interviews revealed two major themes with five subcategories. The results can be summarised in an optimal pathway for access to dementia care. This pathway includes fixed factors such as disease-related factors and system-related factors. In addition there are personal factors that are subject to change such as attitudes towards care. An important finding consisted of the necessity of having sufficient information about the disease and available care and having a key contact person to guide you through the process of finding suitable care while monitoring your needs. In addition, it is important to involve your social network as they can take on care-giving tasks. It is helpful to have a diagnosis (in most countries). Concerning decision-making, the person closest to the person with dementia is in the majority of cases the one who makes the ultimate decision to access and use services and he\/she should therefore be supported in this process. These results provide insight into the factors that influence the pathway to formal care use and help professionals to enhance access to formal dementia care by focusing on factors that can be modified.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 The Authors.

RQ as perceived by carers was associated with carer stress, depression, being a spouse, social support, reported neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia, and carer SOC. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and carer stress contributed to discrepancies in RQ ratings within the dyad. The only factor associated with both individual RQ ratings and discrepancies was carer stress (negative feelings subscore). No significant differences in the overall perception of RQ were evident between spouses and adult children carers, but RQ determinants differed between the two.","In this European sample, carer SOC was associated with carer-reported RQ.

of untimely access is needed.","To examine, from a societal perspective, the impact of untimely access to formal care in terms of total costs and quality of life over one year in community dwelling people with dementia.","Within the Actifcare study, needs, resource use, and quality of life were observed for one year in a cohort of 451 community dwelling people with dementia in 8 European countries. Untimely access to care was operationalized as having at least one unmet need for care identified by the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) instrument. Two regression models were built for both total costs and quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-5L, one using sum of unmet needs and one using a predefined selection of need items.","Unmet needs were not associated with higher total costs but they were associated with a lower quality of life of people with dementia. Of all CANE items, only an unmet need for \"company\" was significantly related to lower total costs.","Total costs did not seem to differ between participants with unmet and met needs. Only few associations between specific unmet needs and costs and quality of life were found. Furthermore, quality of life of people with dementia decreases when multiple unmet needs are experienced, indicating that assessing and meeting needs is important to improve quality of life."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Janssen","ForeName":"Niels","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of

Formal and informal care use was multiplied by country specific unit prices of services. Needs were measured using the CANE and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the person with dementia (both self- and proxy-rated) and informal caregiver's quality of life using EQ-5D-5L, ICECAP-O, DEMQOL-U, and CarerQol utility scores.

Informal caregivers' utility score was 0.84. Across eight countries annual mean costs of formal and informal care were approximately \u20ac 17,000. Unmet needs were not associated with annual costs of care, nor with proxy-rated HRQOL, but were associated with self-rated HRQOL.","We found varying relationships between unmet needs and quality of life, and no association between unmet needs and care costs, although the results were sensitive to various factors.

The barriers and facilitators to service use from the perspectives of different stakeholders involved are not well understood. Thus, we aimed to explore the barriers and facilitators of access to and utilisation of formal care from the perspectives of people with dementia, their informal carers and health and social care professionals.","Focus groups with people with dementia, informal carers and professionals were conducted in eight European countries. Recruitment targeted people with dementia, informal carers with experience of formal care and professionals involved in providing (access to) formal care. Qualitative content analysis using open coding was used on a national level. Cross-national synthesis was based on the translated national reports.","Overall, 55 focus groups with 261 participants were conducted, involving 51 people with dementia, 96 informal carers and 114 professionals. Sixteen categories describing barriers and facilitators were identified, referring to three global themes: Aspects related to 1) individuals involved, 2) the system or 3) overarching aspects. The attitudes and beliefs of people with dementia and their carers may have a major impact, and they often serve as barriers. Formal care was perceived as a threat to the individual independence of people with dementia and was thus avoided as long as possible. A healthcare professional serving as a constant key contact person could be an essential facilitator to overcome these barriers. Contact should be initiated proactively, as early as possible, and a trusting and consistent relationship needs to be established. Beyond that, the findings largely confirm former research and show that barriers to accessing and using formal care still exist across Europe despite a number of national and European initiatives.","Further investigations are needed to elaborate how the concept of a key contact person could be integrated with existing case management approaches and how the independence and autonomy of people with dementia can be strengthened when formal care needs to be accessed and used. These may be meaningful facilitators regarding enhanced access to formal care for people with dementia and their families."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stephan","ForeName":"Astrid","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, 06112, Halle (Saale), Germany. astrid.stephan@medizin.uni-halle.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute for Health and Nursing Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, 06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joyce","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Unit, IRCCS S.

relationship for people with dementia and their carers, however they are often under-used and service acceptability can be low. This study aims to understand key stakeholders' experiences of respite services for people with dementia, with a view to informing respite service development.","A systematic search was conducted of the Pubmed\/MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases (1980-2016, English) with fixed search terms relating to 'respite' and 'dementia', following PRISMA guidelines. Noblit and Hare's approach to meta-ethnography was employed. Key concepts were identified across the papers and reciprocal and refutational translation techniques were applied to primary studies; findings were synthesized into third order interpretations and finally, a 'line-of-argument' was developed.","In total 23 papers were reviewed, which described 20 independent samples across 12 countries. The views of 889 participants were synthesized (13 people with dementia, 690 carers, 44 'service providers', 52 frontline staff, 70 managers, 12 volunteers, six academic\/policy-makers, and two independent consultants). Five key concepts were identified and outlined i.e. 1) the transition to service use 2) expanding organizational capacity 3) dementia care quality 4) building a collaborative care partnership and 5) dyad restoration. There was broad agreement around the key areas for service development across the range of stakeholders (flexible and responsive person-centred care, meaningful activity for people with dementia, enhanced client-service communication and informational support). However, there was clear divergence in stakeholder perspectives around the barriers to implementation of such developments. Organizational tension was evident between frontline staff and management in respite services, hindering the cultural change necessary to facilitate service development in line with dyad's needs and preferences.","Respite services must surmount internal organizational barriers to change, and cultivate a collaborative solution-focused care culture, which acknowledges the centrality of the dyad and their care preferences. Future research should explore the development of alternative\/modified community respite service models, which have greater capacity to be responsive to the needs of each individual dyad. The perspectives of people with dementia must be included in research in this area going forward.","PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42016050191

Needs were measured with the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly. QOL was measured with the QOL-AD, and carer quality of life was measured with the CarerQol. The relationship between needs and QOL was analysed with multiple regression analyses.","Needs were expressed in the domains of psychological distress, daytime activities, company and information. People with dementia rated their unmet needs significantly lower than their carers: the mean number of self-rated unmet needs was 0.95, whereas the mean proxy ratings were 1.66.

The interview guide addressed the topics \"Complexity and Continuity of Care\", \"Formal Services\", and \"Public Awareness\". Country-specific analysis of interview transcripts used an inductive qualitative content analysis. Cross-national synthesis focused on similarities in themes across the ActifCare countries.","The analysis revealed ten common themes and two additional sub-themes across countries. Among others, the experts highlighted the need for a coordinating role and the necessity of information to address issues of complexity and continuity of care, demanded person-centred, tailored, and multidisciplinary formal services, and referred to education, mass media and campaigns as means to raise public awareness.","Policy and political decision makers appear well acquainted with current discussions among both researchers and practitioners of possible approaches to improve access to dementia care. Experts described pragmatic, realistic strategies to influence dementia care. Suggested innovations concerned how to achieve improved dementia care, rather than transforming the nature of the services provided. Knowledge gained in these expert interviews may be useful to national decision makers when they consider reshaping the organisation of dementia care, and may thus help to develop best-practice strategies and recommendations."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Broda","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2564-6521","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany. anja.broda@medizin.uni-halle.de."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bieber","ForeName":"Anja","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Meyer","ForeName":"Gabriele","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Institute of Health and Nursing Sciences, Magdeburger Stra\u00dfe 8, D-06112, Halle (Saale), Germany."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hopper","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Joyce","ForeName":"Rachael","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Zanetti","ForeName":"Orazio","Initials":"O","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"IRCCS S.

recommendations for future research.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"9"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12904-017-0221-0","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Dementia is the most common neurological disorder worldwide and is a life-limiting condition, but very often is not recognised as such. People with dementia, and their carers, have been shown to have palliative care needs equal in extent to those of cancer patients. However, many people with advanced dementia are not routinely being assessed to determine their palliative care needs, and it is not clear why this is so.","An interdisciplinary workshop on \"Palliative Care in Neurodegeneration, with a focus on Dementia\", was held in Cork, Ireland, in May 2016. The key aim of this workshop was to discuss the evidence base for palliative care for people with dementia, to identify 'gaps' for clinical research, and to make recommendations for interdisciplinary research practice. To lead the discussion throughout the day a multidisciplinary panel of expert speakers were brought together, including both researchers and clinicians from across Ireland and the UK. Targeted invitations were sent to attendees ensuring all key stakeholders were present to contribute to discussions. In total, 49 experts representing 17 different academic and practice settings, attended. Key topics for discussion were pre-selected based on previously identified research priorities (e.g. James Lind Alliance) and stakeholder input. Key discussion topics included: i. Advance Care Planning for people with Dementia; ii. Personhood in End-of-life Dementia care; iii. Topics in the care of advanced dementia at home. These topics were used as a starting point, and the ethos of the workshop was that the attendees could stimulate discussion and debate in any relevant area, not just the key topics, summarised under iv. Other priorities.","The care experienced by people with dementia and their families has the potential to be improved; palliative care frameworks may have much to offer in this endeavour. However, a solid evidence base is required to translate palliative care into practice in the context of dementia. This paper presents suggested research priorities as a starting point to build this evidence base. An interdisciplinary approach to research and priority setting is essential to develop actionable knowledge in this area."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fox","ForeName":"Siobh\u00e1n","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for

with dementia and their carers. This study provides clarification on the use and meaning of the term and considers the concept in relation to the dominant care paradigm in dementia, i.e. person-centred care.","Rodgers' (1989) evolutionary framework was employed. A systematic search was conducted on the Pubmed\/MedLine, Embase, Cinahl, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane databases (1980-2016, English) with fixed search terms relating to 'respite' and 'dementia'. Papers with primary qualitative data and literature reviews were included. This search was supplemented with snowballing techniques (back\/forward searching, generic search engines). Data were analysed thematically, through an iterative process of constant comparison.","Respite is understood both as a service that provides a physical break for the carer and as a psychological outcome, i.e. a mental break for the carer, which can be facilitated by formal services, under certain conditions. The conceptual model outlines how client factors (dyadic relations, recognising\/accepting need, carer psychosocial issues, restorative occupation, and stigma) and service factors (model\/characteristics, care quality, staff expertise, meaningful occupation for people with dementia and communication and support), interact to influence a respite outcome. The key antecedent for a positive respite experience is that the carer perceives that mutual benefit is garnered from service use.","The term respite can be interpreted as both a service and an outcome. However, it is clear that 'respite', as currently understood, acknowledges the relational experience of the carer only; it is, therefore, potentially damaging to the planning and delivery of person-centred dementia care. We suggest 'restorative care' as a potential alternative nomenclature to respite care, thereby highlighting the importance of providing mutual, personalised health and social care services that serve to enhance care relationships rather than diminish them."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O' Shea","ForeName":"Emma","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Timmons","ForeName":"Suzanne","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Gerontology & Rehabilitation, University College Cork, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O' Shea","ForeName":"Eamon","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Irish Centre for Social Gerontology, National University of Ireland, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fox","ForeName":"Siobhan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Gerontology & Rehabilitation, University College Cork, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University, Ireland."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"06","Day":"28"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Respite Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Terminology as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["caregivers","dementia","person-centred care","respite","restorative care"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"7","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"6","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28659025","10.1177\/1471301217715325"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28453475","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"03","Day":"16"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"07","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"58","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2017"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"Modifiable Risk Factors for Prevention of\u00a0Dementia in Midlife, Late Life and the Oldest-Old: Validation of the LIBRA Index.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"537-547"},"ELocationID":"10.3233\/JAD-161208","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Recently, the LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA) index was developed to assess an individual's prevention potential for dementia.","We investigated the predictive validity of the LIBRA index for incident dementia in midlife, late life, and the oldest-old.","9,387 non-demented individuals were recruited from the European population-based DESCRIPA study.

to discover different caregiver profiles based on disease related characteristics of 453 persons with dementia and their 453 informal caregivers. These profiles were compared with regard to quality of life (CarerQoL score), depressive symptoms (HADS-D score) and perseverance time.","A 5-class model was identified, with the best Bayesian Information Criterion value, significant likelihood ratio test (p < 0.001), high entropy score (0.88) and substantive interpretability. The classes could be differentiated on two axes: (i) caregivers' age, relationship with persons with dementia, severity of dementia, and (ii) tendency towards stress and difficulty adapting to stress. Classes showed significant differences with all dependent variables, and were labelled 'older low strain', 'older intermediate strain', 'older high strain', 'younger low strain' and 'younger high strain'.","Differences exist between types of caregivers that explain variability in quality of life, depressive symptoms and perseverance time.

This mismatch causes overall dissatisfaction and is a waste of the scarce financial care resources. This article presents the background and methods of the Actifcare (ACcess to Timely Formal Care) project. This is a European study aiming at best-practice development in finding timely access to formal care for community-dwelling people with dementia and their informal carers. There are five main objectives: 1) Explore predisposing and enabling factors associated with the use of formal care, 2) Explore the association between the use of formal care, needs and quality of life and 3) Compare these across European countries, 4) Understand the costs and consequences of formal care services utilization in people with unmet needs, 5) Determine the major costs and quality of life drivers and their relationship with formal care services across European countries.","In a longitudinal cohort study conducted in eight European countries approximately 450 people with dementia and informal carers will be assessed three times in 1\u00a0year (baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months). In this year we will closely monitor the process of finding access to formal care. Data on service use, quality of life and needs will be collected.","The results of Actifcare are expected to reveal best-practices in organizing formal care. Knowledge about enabling and predisposing factors regarding access to care services, as well as its costs and consequences, can advance the state of the art in health systems research into pathways to dementia care, in order to benefit people with dementia and their informal carers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kerpershoek","ForeName":"Liselot","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maastricht

hypotheses on longitudinal study data in an effort to develop new and more reliable algorithms that might determine the possibility of developing certain illnesses. The INnovative, Midlife INtervention for Dementia Deterrence project provides input from a number of European dementia experts to identify the most accurate model of inter-related risk factors which can yield a personalized dementia-risk quotient and profile. This model is then validated against the large population-based prospective Maastricht Aging Study dataset. As part of this overall goal, the research presented in this article demonstrates how we can automate the process of mapping modifiable risk factors against large sections of the aging study and thus use information technology to provide more powerful query interfaces.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Roantree","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O' Donoghue","ForeName":"Jim","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, Ireland jodonoghue@computing.dcu.ie."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O' Kelly","ForeName":"Noel","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pierce","ForeName":"Maria","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dublin City University, Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Van Boxtel","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maastricht University, Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"K\u00f6hler","ForeName":"Sebastian","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maastricht University, Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"01","Day":"06"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Informatics J","NlmUniqueID":"100883604","ISSNLinking":"1460-4582"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aging"},{"DescriptorName":"Algorithms"},{"DescriptorName":"Databases, Factual"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Medical Informatics"},{"DescriptorName":"Prospective Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","modifiable risk factors","ontology","word matching"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"1","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"1","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25564493","1460458214564092","10.1177\/1460458214564092"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25504093","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2015","Month":"09","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"30","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Target risk factors for dementia prevention: a systematic review and Delphi consensus study on the evidence from observational studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"234-46"},"ELocationID":"10.1002\/gps.4245","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Dementia has a multifactorial etiology, but the importance of individual health and lifestyle related risk factors is often uncertain or based on few studies. The goal of this paper is to identify the major modifiable risk factors for dementia as a first step in developing an effective preventive strategy and promoting healthy late life cognitive functioning.","A mixed-method approach combined findings from a systematic literature review and a Delphi consensus study. The literature search was conducted in PubMed and updated an earlier review by the United States National Institutes of Health from 2010. We reviewed the available evidence from observational epidemiological studies. The online Delphi study asked eight international experts to rank and weigh each risk factor for its importance for dementia prevention.","Out of 3127 abstracts, 291 were included in the review. There was good agreement between modifiable risk factors identified in the literature review and risk factors named spontaneously by experts. After triangulation of both methods and re-weighting by experts, strongest support was found for depression, (midlife) hypertension, physical inactivity, diabetes, (midlife) obesity, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, while more research is needed for coronary heart disease, renal dysfunction, diet, and cognitive activity.","Findings provide good support for several somatic and lifestyle factors and will be used to inform the design of a new multicenter trial into dementia prevention."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Deckers","ForeName":"Kay","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Maastricht University, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Alzheimer Centrum Limburg, Maastricht, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van Boxtel","ForeName":"Martin P J","Initials":"MP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Schiepers","ForeName":"Olga J G","Initials":"OJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Vugt","ForeName":"Marjolein","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mu\u00f1oz S\u00e1nchez","ForeName":"Juan Luis","Initials":"JL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Anstey","ForeName":"Kaarin J","Initials":"KJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brayne","ForeName":"Carol","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dartigues","ForeName":"Jean-Francois","Initials":"JF"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Engedal","ForeName":"Knut","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kivipelto","ForeName":"Miia","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ritchie","ForeName":"Karen","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Starr","ForeName":"John M","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Yaffe","ForeName":"Kristine","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Irving","ForeName":"Kate","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Verhey","ForeName":"Frans R J","Initials":"FR"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"K\u00f6hler","ForeName":"Sebastian","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"MR\/K026992\/1","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"12"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Comorbidity"},{"DescriptorName":"Delphi Technique"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["etiology","prevention & control"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Life Style"},{"DescriptorName":"Motor Activity"},{"DescriptorName":"Observational Studies as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Risk Factors"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","epidemiology","prevention","public health","risk factors"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2014","Month":"06","Day":"19"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2014","Month":"10","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"05"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"9","Day":"25","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25504093","10.1002\/gps.4245"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24942810","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-5546","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"21","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"Science and engineering ethics","ISOAbbreviation":"Sci Eng Ethics"},"ArticleTitle":"A review of contemporary work on the ethics of ambient assisted living technologies for people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"707-65"},"ELocationID":"10.1007\/s11948-014-9552-x","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies can provide assistance and support to persons with dementia. They might allow them the possibility of living at home for longer whilst maintaining their comfort and security as well as offering a way towards reducing the huge economic and personal costs forecast as the incidence of dementia increases worldwide over coming decades. However, the development, introduction and use of AAL technologies also trigger serious ethical issues. This paper is a systematic literature review of the on-going scholarly debate about these issues. More specifically, we look at the ethical issues involved in research and development, clinical experimentation, and clinical application of AAL technologies for people with dementia and related stakeholders. In the discussion we focus on: (1) the value of the goals of AAL technologies, (2) the special vulnerability of persons with dementia in their private homes, (3) the complex question of informed consent for the usage of AAL technologies.

have a critical debate over how this should be realized. In this paper, we offer a synthesis of two approaches to care: mental health recovery and person-centred care, and apply them to early-stage dementia care. 'Person-centred care' has become a catchphrase for good dementia care. However, many people have not experienced improvements in care, and other lynch pin concepts, such as 'mental health recovery', might have utility in driving reform. The similarities and differences between the two approaches are drawn out, and the difficulties of using the word 'recovery' when discussing a degenerative disease are highlighted. The implications of this discussion for early intervention are discussed. It could be seen that the two bodies of knowledge have much to offer each other, despite initial dissonance with the label of recovery in dementia care.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2010 The Authors.
