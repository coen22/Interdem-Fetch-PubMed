Anti-psychotics are used to treat such behaviour, but are associated with significant morbidity. This study researched the feasibility of conducting a trial of a full clinical medication review for care home residents with behaviour that challenges, combined with staff training. This paper focusses on the feasibility of measuring clinical outcomes and intervention costs.","People living with moderate to severe dementia, receiving psychotropics for behaviour that challenges, in care homes were recruited for a medication review by a specialist pharmacist. Care home and primary care staff received training on the management of challenging behaviour. Data were collected at 8\u2009weeks, and 3 and 6\u2009months. Measures were Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH), cognition (sMMSE), quality of life (EQ-5D-5\u2009L\/DEMQoL) and costs (Client Services Receipt Inventory). Response rates, for clinical, quality of life and health economic measures, including the levels of resource-use associated with the medication review and other non-intervention costs were calculated.","Twenty-nine of 34 participants recruited received a medication review. It was feasible to measure the effects of the complex intervention on the management of behaviour that challenges with the NPI-NH. There was valid NPI-NH data at each time point (response rate\u2009=\u2009100%). The sMMSE response rate was 18.2%. Levels of resource-use associated with the medication review were estimated for all 29 participants who received a medication review. Good response levels were achieved for other non-intervention costs (100% completion rate), and the EQ-5D-5\u2009L and DEMQoL (\u226588% at each of the time points where data was collected).","It is feasible to measure the clinical and cost effectiveness of a complex intervention for behaviour that challenges using the NPI-NH and quality of life measures.","ISRCTN58330068.

Acting as a caregiver can make it difficult to access sources of support, particularly in the later stages of dementia. This paper reports the development and presents the targets (subject areas) and components of a prototype website to support family caregivers of a person with dementia towards the end of life.","Adopting an iterative approach and co-production methods the development process consisted of four stages: Stage1-Synthesis of data: three sources of data (interviews, systematic review and theory) were synthesised using tabulation, to identify the targets of the prototype; Stage2-Identifying intervention targets and components: a research development group (health practitioners, a family caregiver and academic experts) met to discuss the development, using a modified nominal group process, refining the synthesis from stage 1; Stage3-Developing the intervention prototype: an outline of the prototype was developed based on stage 1 and 2; and Stage4-User testing: interviews with caregivers testing the prototype website.","Qualitative interviews with caregivers identified four targets for the intervention: 1) feeling prepared and equipped; 2) feeling connected and supported; 3) valuing themselves as a caregiver and as an individual; 4) maintaining control of the caring situation and being the coordinator of care. The systematic review provided evidence on how and what components could address these targets, including providing information, peer support, contact with professionals, and psychological support. Theory helped to narrow the focus within each of these targets. Active discussion with the research development group and end users provided an outline of the prototype website. The prototype website presented addresses these targets with written information, videos from other caregivers, and peer and professional support sections. The subject areas covered included expectations at the end of life, support with day-to-day caring, care planning, and communication.","This paper provides a detailed account of the development process of a prototype website for caregiver support. The transparent methodology and key lessons learnt from developing the prototype should help those who are developing similar interventions, across complex, progressive conditions and not just limited

of the most challenging caring roles; however, the demands of the role towards the end of life often mean carers are unable to maintain face-to-face support. The aim of this study was to: (a) Explore the experiences of older (over 65\u00a0years) family carers of people with dementia of support towards the end of life; (b) Explore with family carers the role of the internet as a support for them at the end of life. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, with purposive sampling from general practice and research networks to recruit 20 current and former family carers aged 65 and over in England (2016-2017). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. An overarching theme of the \"separation of worlds\" (the internal caring world and the outside world of society) was identified, with four sub themes: (a) the support role of relationships and social networks; (b) loss as a consequence of caring; (c) reconstruction of life as a carer; and finally; (d) life within and beyond the computer screen. This study demonstrates the complexity of social support at the end of life for family carers depicted in a model of two worlds. The internet can be seen as a viable approach to help carers maintain existing networks, reconstruct networks they have lost or developing new networks to meet their new needs and circumstances as a carer. Future support interventions should focus on a mixed model of technology and human interaction.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons

of challenges and difficult decisions for practitioners. These challenges may include assessment and management of difficulties with eating and swallowing, responding to agitation, treating pain, and managing recurrent infections. Practitioners sometimes lack both confidence in making end of life decisions and guidance. This study developed an alternative to lengthy guidelines, in the form of heuristics which were tested in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to test the usability and acceptability of a set of heuristics which could be used by practitioners providing EOLC for people with dementia in a variety of clinical and care settings.","A three phase co-design process was adopted: 1) Synthesis of evidence and outputs from interviews and focus groups with family carers and practitioners, by a co-design group, to develop heuristics; 2) Testing of the heuristics in five clinical or care settings for six months; 3) Evaluation of the heuristics at three and six months using qualitative individual and group interviews.","Four heuristics were developed covering: eating and swallowing difficulties, agitation and restlessness, reviewing treatment and interventions at the end of life, and providing routine care. The five sites reported that the heuristics were simple and easy to use, comprehensive, and made implicit, tacit knowledge explicit. Four themes emerged from the qualitative evaluation: authority and permission; synthesis of best practice; providing a structure and breaking down complexity; and reassurance and instilling confidence.","Use of heuristics is a novel approach to end of life decision making in dementia which can be useful to both experienced and junior members of staff making decisions. Heuristics are a practical tool which could overcome a lack of care pathways and direct guidance in end of life care for people with dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Nathan","Initials":"N","Identifier":"0000-0001-7757-5353","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Research

people living with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"340"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12888-018-1907-4","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["\"Behaviour that Challenges\" is common in people living with dementia, resident in care homes and historically has been treated with anti-psychotics. However, such usage is associated with 1800 potentially avoidable deaths annually in the UK. This study investigated the feasibility of a full clinical trial of a specialist dementia care pharmacist medication review combined with a health psychology intervention for care staff to limit the use of psychotropics. This paper focuses on feasibility; including recruitment and retention, implementation of medication change recommendations and the experiences and expectations of care staff.","West Midlands care homes and individuals meeting the inclusion criteria (dementia diagnosis; medication for behaviour that challenges), or their personal consultee, were approached for consent. A specialist pharmacist reviewed medication. Care home staff received an educational behaviour change intervention in a three-hour session promoting person-centred care. Primary healthcare staff received a modified version of the training. The primary outcome measure was the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version at 3\u00a0months. Other outcomes included quality of life, cognition, health economics and prescribed medication. A qualitative evaluation explored expectations and experiences of care staff.","Five care homes and 34 of 108 eligible residents (31.5%) were recruited, against an original target of 45 residents across 6 care homes. Medication reviews were conducted for 29 study participants (85.3%) and the pharmacist recommended stopping or reviewing medication in 21 cases (72.4%). Of the recommendations made, 57.1% (12 of 21) were implemented, and implementation (discontinuation) took a mean of 98.4\u00a0days. In total, 164 care staff received training and 21 were interviewed. Care staff reported a positive experience of the intervention and post intervention adopting a more holistic patient-centred approach.","The intervention contained two elements; staff training and medication review. It was feasible to implement the staff training, and the training appeared to increase the ability and confidence of care staff to manage behaviour that challenges without the need for medication. The medication review would require significant modification for full trial partly related to the relatively limited uptake of the recommendations made, and delay in implementation.","ISRCTN58330068 .

society. For individuals diagnosed with dementia this preoccupation with risk can affect their day-to-day life in many ways. Maintaining autonomy while balancing risks is a continual struggle not only for those living with the disease, but also their carers, family and health professionals. To understand how these different groups of individuals conceptualise the issue of risk for those living with dementia, 83 semi-structured interviews were conducted with people living with dementia, carers, older people without significant experience of dementia, and registered nurses, and staff from a community nursing organisation. These interviews were analysed using Thematic Analysis, which suggested that the risks identified by each group were grounded in their experiences and perspective on dementia. Furthermore, context and understanding of the individual living with dementia and their preferences was central to effectively managing risk in a balanced way, ensuring that 'acceptable risks' were taken to ensure an acceptable quality of life for all involved. These findings highlight that there is no single approach to risk which can be applied to all individuals; rather, a negotiation needs to take place that takes into account the individual's preferences alongside their available resources and means.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.

It offers a comprehensive framework for conceptualising various types of case management and asks the question: who can be a case manager? Building on examples from three European countries it addresses the problem of the expansion and adoption of the case management method. It compares the conventional model of diffusion of innovation with the ideas of interessement and co-constitution and envisions a successful model of case management as a fluid technology that is both friendly and flexible, allowing it to adapt to different settings and systems."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Synek","ForeName":"Michal","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Czech Republic."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carboch","ForeName":"Radek","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic; Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social Studies, Masaryk University, Czech Republic."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hradcov\u00e1","ForeName":"Dana","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Holmerov\u00e1","ForeName":"Iva","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre of Expertise in Longevity and Long-term Care, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"03","Day":"17"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Case Management","QualifierName":"economics"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Diffusion of Innovation"},{"DescriptorName":"Efficiency, Organizational"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["case management","dementia","fluid technology","interessement","translation of case management"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"19","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29149792","10.1177\/1471301217697802"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29138202","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"06","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"02","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2044-6055","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"7","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"Nov","Day":"14"}},"Title":"BMJ open","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ Open"},"ArticleTitle":"Development of a discussion tool to enable well-being by providing choices for people with dementia: a qualitative study incorporating codesign and participatory action research.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e017672"},"ELocationID":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2017-017672","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To codesign a discussion tool to facilitate negotiation of risk between health professionals, people with dementia and carers.","A qualitative approach using codesign.

progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by declining functional and cognitive abilities. The quality of end of life care for people with dementia in the UK can be poor. Several difficult decisions may arise at the end of life, relating to the care of the person with dementia, for example management of comorbidities.","To explore difficulties in decision making for practitioners and family carers at the end of life for people with dementia.","Qualitative methodology using focus groups and semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis methods.","Former (n=4) and current (n=6) family carers of people with experience of end of life care for a person with dementia were recruited from an English dementia voluntary group in 2015. A further 24 health and care professionals were purposively sampled to include a broad range of expertise and experience in dementia end of life care.","Four key themes were identified as follows: challenges of delivering coherent care in dynamic systems; uncertainty amongst decision makers; internal and external conflict amongst decision makers; and a lack of preparedness for the end of life. Overarching difficulties such as poor communication, uncertainty and conflict about the needs of the person with dementia as well as the decision maker's own role can characterize decision making at the end of life.","This study suggests that decision making at the end of life for people with dementia has the potential to be improved. More planning earlier in the course of dementia with an on-going approach to conversation may increase preparedness and family carers' expectations of end of life."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9

Various dementia care models have been developed to address patient's healthcare needs. They can be described as \"collaborative care\" or \"person-centered care\". Referring to the needs of the workforce working with persons with dementia, a\u00a0key element is the use of interprofessional education (IPE).","The purpose of this article is to describe different international collaborative care models to define a\u00a0minimum standard of healthcare professions for collaborative dementia care in primary care. This helps to identify requirements for IPE to optimize care of people with dementia and to support informal caregivers in the future.","In this article six dementia care models from 4 different countries (Germany, USA, UK and Netherlands) are described and compared regarding aims, interventions and healthcare professionals involved.","Care teams are minimally comprised of general practitioners or primary care providers, nurses, and social workers. Additional healthcare disciplines may be involved for specific interventions. Mostly, care team members received specific training but such training did not necessarily incorporate the IPE approach. To ensure successful collaboration of professions, IPE training programs should at least consist of the following core topics: (1) early diagnosis, (2) postdiagnostic support, (3) advanced care planning for patients and caregivers and (4) effective collaborative care.","The IPE programs for dementia should be expanded and must be widely implemented in order to assess the impact on collaborative practice.

syndrome is a\u00a0policy imperative in many countries. In the UK the achievement of earlier and timelier recognition has been pursued through educational interventions, incentivisation of general practitioners and the promotion of a\u00a0network of memory clinics.","The effectiveness of education, incentivisation and memory clinic activity are unknown. This article analyses data from different sources to evaluate the impact of these interventions on the incidence and prevalence of dementia, and the diagnostic performance of memory clinics.","Three data sources were used: 1)\u00a0aggregated, anonymised data from a\u00a0network of general practices using the same electronic medical record software, The Health Information Network (THIN), 2)\u00a0UK Health & Social Care Information Centre data reports and 3)\u00a0Responses to Freedom of Information Act requests.","Educational interventions did not appear to change the recorded incidence of dementia syndrome. There was no apparent effect of education, incentives or memory clinic activity on the reported incidence of dementia syndrome between 1997 and 2011 but there were signs of change in the documentation of consultations with people with dementia. There was no clear impact of incentivisation and memory clinic activity in prevalence data. Memory clinics are seeing more patients but fewer are being diagnosed with dementia.","It is not clear why there has been no upturn in documented incidence or prevalence of dementia syndrome despite substantial efforts and this requires further investigation to guide policy changes.

This study was designed to explore general practitioners' opinions concerning barriers to diagnosing dementia, following implementation of strategies aimed at reducing them. The study involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 13 general practitioners from seven practices in North London or the West Midlands. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts was carried out using the Framework approach. We identified four major themes: organisational factors, clinician-related factors, patient-related factors and societal influences. The study findings revealed barriers previously unidentified in the literature which warrant further investigation, including the limits of diagnostic tools, lack of cultural applicability of these tools, and prioritisation of severe over mildly symptomatic patients by dementia services."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chithiramohan","ForeName":"Anita","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Khattak","ForeName":"Iram","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The Khattak Memorial Surgery, Birmingham, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"General Practitioners"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Policy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Physician-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Referral and Consultation","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","diagnosis","general practitioner","qualitative methods"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"12","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27941159","1471301216682625","10.1177\/1471301216682625"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27916749","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"06","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1468-2834","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"46","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"05","Day":"01"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"Inequalities in receipt of mental and physical healthcare in people with dementia in the UK.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"393-400"},"ELocationID":"10.1093\/ageing\/afw208","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["UK Dementia Strategies prioritise fair access to mental and physical healthcare.

Towards the end of life, people with dementia cannot report on the care they receive. It is therefore important to talk to caregivers; however, few have explored the views about end-of-life care from the caregivers' perspective. The majority of research on family caregivers has focussed on the burden and psychological impact of caring for a relative with dementia.","This study aimed to explore the views of family caregivers about quality end-of-life care for people with dementia.","Qualitative study using in-depth interviews and analysed using thematic analysis.","Purposive sampling from a third sector organisation's caregiver network was used to recruit 47 caregivers in England (2012-2013), consisting of (1) family caregivers of someone who had recently received a diagnosis of dementia, (2) family caregivers currently caring for someone with dementia and (3) bereaved family caregivers.","Three over-arching themes were derived from the interviewees' discourse, including maintaining the person within, fostering respect and dignity and showing compassion and kindness.","End-of-life care for people with dementia does not differ from care throughout the dementia trajectory. Throughout the findings, there is an implicit underlying theme of conflict: conflict between family caregivers and an increasingly systematised service of care and conflict between family caregivers and professionals.

first to explore informal dementia caregivers' perceptions and outlook on written materials about all food-related processes: shopping, food preparation, and eating. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate the content, format, and usefulness of two separate booklets (one newly developed and one existing) on food-related processes. Twenty dementia caregivers were provided with one of the two booklets, and a Think-Aloud method was used to gather information about their views on the booklets. The findings indicated that incorporating all three food processes in a new booklet could be beneficial for the participant. Shopping, purchasing food, driving, and dangers in the kitchen were addressed only in the developed booklet, and participants regarded them as important and useful areas to address. Therefore, this study has shown that tailored information may enhance caregivers' confidence and support them in making decisions to help them adapt to food-related changes."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Papachristou","ForeName":"Iliatha","Initials":"I","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hickeys","ForeName":"Gary","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"2 Kingston University, Surrey, BC, Canada."},{"Affiliation":"3 St George's, University of London, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1 University College London, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"08","Day":"05"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Appl Gerontol","NlmUniqueID":"8606502","ISSNLinking":"0733-4648"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Automobile Driving"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Commerce"},{"DescriptorName":"Cooking"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Drinking"},{"DescriptorName":"Eating"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Food","QualifierName":"economics"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Menu Planning"},{"DescriptorName":"Pamphlets"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Restaurants"},{"DescriptorName":"Validation Studies as Topic"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","food-related processes","informal caregiving","qualitative methodology","written information"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"11","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"8","Day":"7","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27496141","0733464816661946","10.1177\/0733464816661946"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27484683","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"05","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-684X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Aug","Day":"02"}},"Title":"BMC palliative care","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Palliat Care"},"ArticleTitle":"A co-design process developing heuristics for practitioners providing end of life care for people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"68"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12904-016-0146-z","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The end of life for someone with dementia can present many challenges for practitioners; such as, providing care if there are swallowing difficulties. This study aimed to develop a toolkit of heuristics (rules-of-thumb) to aid practitioners making end-of-life care decisions for people with dementia.","An iterative co-design approach was adopted using a literature review and qualitative methods, including; 1) qualitative interviews and focus groups with family carers and 2) focus groups with health and care professionals. Family carers were recruited from a national charity, purposively sampling those with experience of end-of-life care for a person with dementia. Health and care professionals were purposively sampled to include a broad range of expertise including; general practitioners, palliative care specialists, and geriatricians. A co-design group was established consisting of health and social care experts and family carers, to synthesise the findings from the qualitative work and produce a toolkit of heuristics to be tested in practice.","Four broad areas were identified as requiring complex decisions at the end of life; 1) eating\/swallowing difficulties, 2) agitation\/restlessness, 3) ending life-sustaining treatment, and 4) providing \"routine care\" at the end of life. Each topic became a heuristic consisting of rules arranged into flowcharts. Eating\/swallowing difficulties have three rules; ensuring eating\/swallowing difficulties do not come as a surprise, considering if the situation is an emergency, and considering 'comfort feeding' only versus time-trialled artificial feeding. Agitation\/restlessness encourages a holistic approach, considering the environment, physical causes, and the carer's wellbeing. Ending life-sustaining treatment supports practitioners through a process of considering the benefits of treatment versus quality-of-life and comfort. Finally, a heuristic on providing routine care such as bathing, prompts practitioners to consider adapting the delivery of care, in order to promote comfort and dignity at the end of life.","The heuristics are easy to use and remember, offering a novel approach to decision making for dementia end-of-life care. They have the potential to be used alongside existing end-of-life care recommendations, adding more readily available practical assistance. This is the first study to synthesise experience and existing evidence into easy-to-use heuristics for dementia end-of-life care."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Nathan","Initials":"N","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7757-5353","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK.

behaviour that challenges is associated with an estimated 1800 deaths annually. However, solely focusing on antipsychotics may transfer prescribing to other equally dangerous psychotropics. Little is known about the role of pharmacists in the management of psychotropics used to treat behaviours that challenge. This research aims to determine whether it is feasible to implement and measure the effectiveness of a combined pharmacy-health psychology intervention incorporating a medication review and staff training package to limit the prescription of psychotropics to manage behaviour that challenges in care home residents with dementia.","6 care homes within the West Midlands will be recruited. People with dementia receiving medication for behaviour that challenges, or their personal consultee, will be approached regarding participation. Medication used to treat behaviour that challenges will be reviewed by the pharmacist, in collaboration with the general practitioner (GP), person with dementia and carer. The behavioural intervention consists of a training package for care home staff and GPs promoting person-centred care and treating behaviours that challenge as an expression of unmet need. The primary outcome measure is the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH). Other outcomes include quality of life (EQ-5D and DEMQoL), cognition (sMMSE), health economic (CSRI) and prescribed medication including whether recommendations were implemented. Outcome data will be collected at 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Pretraining and post-training interviews will explore stakeholders' expectations and experiences of the intervention. Data will be used to estimate the sample size for a definitive study.","The project has received a favourable opinion from the East Midlands REC (15\/EM\/3014). If potential participants lack capacity, a personal consultee will be consulted regarding participation in line with the Mental Capacity Act. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences."],"CopyrightInformation":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

whole population. We investigated for the first time inequalities in NHS national dementia prescribing and how they have varied between UK countries and over time.","we investigated the association between Townsend deprivation score and anti-dementia drug prescribing in 77,045 dementia patients from UK primary care records from 2002 to 2013.","we included 77,045 patients with recorded dementia diagnosis or anti-dementia drug prescription. Least deprived patients were 25% more likely to be initiated on anti-dementia drugs than the most deprived (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.31). This was driven by data from English practices where prescribing rates were consistently lower in more deprived patients compared with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, where prescribing was not related to deprivation quintile. Compared with English practices, anti-dementia medication was prescribed more often in Northern Irish (1.81, 1.41-2.34) and less in Welsh practices (0.68, 0.55-0.82), with a trend towards more prescribing in Scottish practices (1.14, 0.98-1.32). Drug initiation rates were also higher in younger people and men.","four years after the English National Dementia Strategy, there is no evidence that the Strategy's key objective of reducing treatment inequalities is being achieved. Higher overall anti-dementia drug prescribing in Scottish and Northern Irish practices, and differing clinical guidelines in Scotland from other UK countries might explain greater equality in prescribing in these countries.

behaviour for people with dementia using interviews with 84 carers recruited through general practice. Memory loss was the most commonly reported first symptom but psychological and behavioural symptoms were also common at onset. In over a third of individuals help-seeking was delayed for a mean of 25 months (range 6-69, SD 19.3). Help-seeking between those who attributed symptoms to dementia, or to unknown causes, and those who attributed symptoms to personality, ageing, life events or other illnesses was statistically significant ( p\u2009<\u20090.001). No statistically significant associations between help-seeking and patient or carer characteristics were found.

In this study we adapted and implemented a successful United States' model of case management in primary care in England. The results are reported elsewhere, but a key finding was that little case management took place. This paper reports the findings of the process evaluation which used Normalization Process Theory to understand the barriers to implementation.","Ethnographic methods were used to explore the views and experiences of case management. Interviews with 49 stakeholders (patients, carers, case managers, health and social care professionals) were supplemented with observation of case managers during meetings and initial assessments with patients. Transcripts and field notes were analysed initially using the constant comparative approach and emerging themes were then mapped onto the framework of Normalization Process Theory.","The primary focus during implementation was on the case managers as isolated individuals, with little attention being paid to the social or organizational context within which they worked. Barriers relating to each of the four main constructs of Normalization Process Theory were identified, with a lack of clarity over the scope and boundaries of the intervention (coherence); variable investment in the intervention (cognitive participation); a lack of resources, skills and training to deliver case management (collective action); and limited reflection and feedback on the case manager role (reflexive monitoring).","Despite the intuitive appeal of case management to all stakeholders, there were multiple barriers to implementation in primary care in England including: difficulties in embedding case managers within existing well-established community networks; the challenges of protecting time for case management; and case managers' inability to identify, and act on, emerging patient and carer needs (an essential, but previously unrecognised, training need). In the light of these barriers it is unclear whether primary care is the most appropriate setting for case management in England. The process evaluation highlights key aspects of implementation and training to be addressed in future studies of case management for dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bamford","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute

two-thirds have limited mental capacity. Despite initiatives to reduce unplanned hospital admissions for this population, little is known about the involvement of emergency services in supporting residents in these settings.","This paper reports on a longitudinal study that tracked the involvement of emergency ambulance personnel in the support of older people with dementia, resident in care homes with no on-site nursing providing personal care only. 133 residents with dementia across 6 care homes in the East of England were tracked for a year. The paper examines the frequency and reasons for emergency ambulance call-outs, outcomes and factors associated with emergency ambulance service use.","56% of residents used ambulance services. Less than half (43%) of all call-outs resulted in an unscheduled admission to hospital. In addition to trauma following a following a fall in the home, results suggest that at least a reasonable proportion of ambulance contacts are for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. An emergency ambulance is not likely to be called for older rather than younger residents or for women more than men. Length of residence does not influence use of emergency ambulance services among older people with dementia. Contact with primary care services and admission route into the care home were both significantly associated with emergency ambulance service use. The odds of using emergency ambulance services for residents admitted from a relative's home were 90% lower than the odds of using emergency ambulance services for residents admitted from their own home.","Emergency service involvement with this vulnerable population merits further examination. Future research on emergency ambulance service use by older people with dementia in care homes, should account for important contextual factors, namely, presence or absence of on-site nursing, GP involvement, and access to residents' family, alongside resident health characteristics."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Amador","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Goodman","ForeName":"Claire","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre

families need support in different forms, but currently services are often fragmented with variable quality of care. Case management offers a way of co-ordinating services along the care pathway and therefore could provide individualised support; however, evidence of the effectiveness of case management for dementia is inconclusive.","To adapt the intervention used in a promising case management project in the USA and test its feasibility and acceptability in English general practice.","In work package 1, a design group of varied professionals, with a carer and staff from the voluntary sector, met six times over a year to identify the skills and personal characteristics required for case management; protocols from the US study were adapted for use in the UK. The feasibility of recruiting general practices and patient-carer dyads and of delivering case management were tested in a pilot study (work package 2). An embedded qualitative study explored stakeholder views on study procedures and case management.","Four general practices, two in the north-east of England (Newcastle) one in London and one in Norfolk, took part in a feasibility pilot study of case management.","Community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers who were not already being case managed by other services.","A social worker shared by the two practices in the north-east and practice nurses in the other two practices were trained to deliver case management. We aimed to recruit 11 people with dementia from each practice who were not already being case managed.","Numbers of people with dementia and their carers recruited, numbers and content of contacts, needs identified and perceptions of case management among stakeholders.","Recruitment of practices and patients was slow and none of the practices achieved its recruitment target. It took more than 6 months to recruit a total of 28 people with dementia. Practice Quality and Outcome Framework registers for dementia contained only 60% of the expected number of people, most living in care homes. All stakeholders were positive about the potential of case management; however, only one of the four practices achieved a level of case management activity that might have influenced patient and carer outcomes. Case managers' activity levels were not related solely to time available for case management. Delivery of case management was hindered by limited clarity about the role, poor integration with existing services and a lack of embeddedness within primary care. There were discrepancies between case manager and researcher judgements about need, and evidence of a high threshold for acting on unmet need. The practice nurses experienced difficulties in ring-fencing case management time.","The model of case management developed and evaluated in this feasibility study is unlikely to be sustainable in general practice under current conditions and in our view it would not be appropriate to attempt a definitive trial of this model. This study could inform the development of a case management role with a greater likelihood of impact. Different approaches to recruiting and training case managers, and identifying people with dementia who might benefit from case management, are needed, as is exploration of the scale of need for this type of working.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN74015152.","This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 18, No. 52.

with dementia. Despite the recent increase in care home research, residents with dementia are often excluded from studies. Care home research networks have been recommended by the Ministerial Advisory Group on Dementia Research (MAGDR) as a way of increasing research opportunities for residents with dementia. This paper reports on an evaluation of the feasibility and early impact of an initiative to increase care home participation in research.","A two phase, mixed methods approach was used; phase 1 established a baseline of current and recent studies including the National Institute for Health Research portfolio. To explore the experiences of recruiting care homes and research participation, interviews were conducted with researchers working for the Dementia and Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN) and care home managers. In phase 2, four DeNDRoN area offices recruited care homes to a care home network for their region. The care home networks were separate from the DeNDRoN research network. Diaries were used to document and cost recruitment; DeNDRoN staff were interviewed to understand the barriers, facilitators and impact of the care home networks.","Thirty three current or recent studies were identified as involving care homes as care home specific studies or those which included residents. Further details of care home recruitment were obtained on 20 studies by contacting study teams. Care home managers were keen to be involved in research that provided staff support, benefits for residents and with minimal disruption. In phase 2, 141 care homes were recruited to the care home research networks, through corporate engagement and individual invitation. Pre-existing relationships with care homes facilitated recruitment. Sites with minimal experience of working with care homes identified the need for care home training for researchers.","Phase 1 review revealed a small but increasing number of studies involving care homes. Phase 2 demonstrated the feasibility of care home research networks, their potential to increase recruitment to research and develop partnerships between health services and care homes, but highlighted the need for care home training for researchers."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Davies","ForeName":"Sue

overlooked or misattributed by primary care practitioners and is underdiagnosed. This might be explained by a lack of formal training in the diagnosis of dementia combined with a reluctance to diagnose due to its associated stigma. This paper describes focus group work with service users, carers and health professionals, conducted to develop an educational intervention for primary care promoting person-centred responses to people experiencing cognitive decline and dementia. Data was analysed thematically and four themes emerged: Reframing dementia as cognitive decline (Individual level); triggers for the recognition of dementia (Practitioner level); engaging the whole primary care team (Practice level); the relationship between primary and secondary care (Service level). Findings are discussed in the context of their contribution to challenging attitudes to dementia in primary care and the positive aspects of person-centred primary care for dementia.

Having a close relationship as a carer gives a unique and poignant view. What emerges from this review is a range of perspectives that provide contrasting views of the heterogeneity of carers and professionals.

This study explored perceived barriers to the delivery of high-quality palliative care for people with dementia using semi-structured interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis with an inductive approach and a coding strategy. To improve the trustworthiness of the analysis, independent reading and coding of the transcripts were undertaken, followed by discussions among the four researchers to reach agreement and consensus of the themes. Two group interviews (n\u00a0=\u00a07 and n\u00a0=\u00a06), 16 individual interviews and five interviews of pairs of professionals were conducted in 2011\/2012 with participants from backgrounds in palliative care, dementia services, palliative care research and policy making. Four themes were identified as barriers to providing high-quality palliative care for people with dementia: (i) ambivalence towards the systematisation of palliative care; (ii) disconnection between services; (iii) different assumptions about training needs; and (iv) negotiation of risk. Understanding these barriers to providing high-quality palliative care for people with dementia could help in the development of a dementia-specific palliative care pathway.

Palliative care for people with dementia poses particular challenges to those providing services, and current policy initiatives recommend education and training in palliative care for those working with patients with dementia. However, there are few evaluations of the effectiveness of dementia education and training. This paper presents a narrative review undertaken in 2011-2012 of evaluations of palliative care education for those working with people with dementia at the end of life. A total of eight papers were identified that described and evaluated such palliative care education; none reported benefits for people with dementia. There is a clear need to develop and evaluate educational interventions designed to improve palliative and end-of-life care for people with dementia. Some suggestions for educationally sound approaches are discussed.

with dementia using review papers.","There are increasing numbers of people being diagnosed with dementia worldwide, and the needs of people with dementia and their carers at the end of life may be different from those with other chronic diseases. By highlighting the challenges of palliative care in persons with dementia and the ways they are best managed, practitioners in primary care may be able to improve services for this group of people at the end of life.","A search of electronic databases of English language papers published in peer-reviewed journals, 2000-2011 inclusive was undertaken using broad terms related to palliative care and dementia. 6167 papers were identified. Titles and abstracts were read. Papers were included if they were literature reviews of palliative or end of life care for people with dementia\/Parkinson's disease\/Lewy body dementia\/cognitive impairment\/Alzheimer's disease or any other cognitive impairment, in any setting (hospital, care home, community) and covering people of all ages. Papers were excluded if they covered palliative care focusing on other conditions, or were about an aspect of dementia care and treatment not related to palliative care.","Our critical synthesis generated five main themes from this review of the reviews: (1) carers' (family caregivers') experiences; (2) person-centred care; (3) practice (including advance care planning, pain and comfort, nutrition, medical complications and minimizing the distress of behavioural symptoms); (4) system factors, including ethical dilemmas, decision making, information, and training; and (5) research priorities.

However, dementia remains underdetected and suboptimally managed in general practice.

The primary outcome measure was an increase in the proportion of patients with dementia who received at least two documented dementia-specific management reviews per year. Case identification was a secondary outcome measure.","23 practices in South-East England participated. A total of 1,072 patients with dementia (intervention: 512, control: 560) had information in their medical records showing the number of reviews within 12 months (or a proportion of) before intervention or randomization and within 12 months (or a proportion of) after. The mean total number of dementia management reviews after the educational intervention for people with dementia was 0.89 (SD 1.09; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 8) compared with 0.89 (SD 0.92; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 4) before intervention. In the control group prior to randomization the mean total number of dementia management reviews was 1.66 (SD 1.87; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 12) and in the period after randomization it was 1.56 (SD 1.79; minimum 0; median 1; maximum 11).

burdensome diseases. Incontinence in people with dementia is distressing, adds to carer burden, and influences decisions to relocate people to care homes. Successful and safe management of incontinence in people with dementia presents additional challenges. The aim of this study was to investigate the rates of first diagnosis in primary care of urinary and faecal incontinence among people aged 60-89 with dementia, and the use of medication or indwelling catheters for urinary incontinence.","We extracted data on 54,816 people aged 60-89 with dementia and an age-gender stratified sample of 205,795 people without dementia from 2001 to 2010 from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a United Kingdom primary care database. THIN includes data on patients and primary care consultations but does not identify care home residents. Rate ratios were adjusted for age, sex, and co-morbidity using multilevel Poisson regression. The rates of first diagnosis per 1,000 person-years at risk (95% confidence interval) for urinary incontinence in the dementia cohort, among men and women, respectively, were 42.3 (40.9-43.8) and 33.5 (32.6-34.5). In the non-dementia cohort, the rates were 19.8 (19.4-20.3) and 18.6 (18.2-18.9). The rates of first diagnosis for faecal incontinence in the dementia cohort were 11.1 (10.4-11.9) and 10.1 (9.6-10.6). In the non-dementia cohort, the rates were 3.1 (2.9-3.3) and 3.6 (3.5-3.8). The adjusted rate ratio for first diagnosis of urinary incontinence was 3.2 (2.7-3.7) in men and 2.7 (2.3-3.2) in women, and for faecal incontinence was 6.0 (5.1-7.0) in men and 4.5 (3.8-5.2) in women. The adjusted rate ratio for pharmacological treatment of urinary incontinence was 2.2 (1.4-3.7) for both genders, and for indwelling urinary catheters was 1.6 (1.3-1.9) in men and 2.3 (1.9-2.8) in women.","Compared with those without a dementia diagnosis, those with a dementia diagnosis have approximately three times the rate of diagnosis of urinary incontinence, and more than four times the rate of faecal incontinence, in UK primary care. The clinical management of urinary incontinence in people with dementia with medication and particularly the increased use of catheters is concerning and requires further investigation.

dementia affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the disease course and result in distress, increased carer burden, high service utilization and unwanted moves to care homes. Research has focused on long-term settings and has not considered people with dementia living at home and at different stages of the disease trajectory. Our aim is to review systematically the evidence concerning non-pharmacological strategies to minimise behavioural and psychological symptoms in community-dwelling older people with dementia.","Our approach is a two-stage co-design: a systematic mapping of the broad evidence around behavioural and psychological symptoms followed by an in-depth systematic review of studies of non-pharmacological interventions for behavioural and psychological symptoms from the perspective of their impact on community-dwelling older people with dementia and their carers. The review will include published literature involving a wide range of electronic databases using sensitive and comprehensive searches and lateral searching including checking citations.We will produce a descriptive map of the studies by design and by the focus of interventions and apply further inclusion criteria, developed in conjunction with lay experts, to select studies for an in-depth systematic review that will include independent quality assessment and detailed data extraction by two reviewers.The review process will be integrated with stakeholder meetings and a multidisciplinary expert advisory group to guide the review parameters and shape the research questions on the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms in people with dementia. Because studies are likely to be diverse in methodology and interventions, we will conduct a narrative synthesis of the in-depth systematic review. If appropriate, we will pool studies in a meta-analysis. We will explore review findings at both stages through focus groups and interviews with service providers, practitioners, people with dementia and carers.","This integrated review in collaboration with key stakeholders will synthesise research evidence to identify appropriate interventions for effective management of behavioural and psychological symptoms that supports people with dementia living at home and their carers, and which reflects their priorities. It will make recommendations for research and practice.","PROSPERO registration number:

A successful case management methodology was adapted from the United States (US) version for use in English primary care, with a view to a definitive trial. Medical Research Council guidance on the development of complex interventions was implemented in the adaptation process, to capture the skill sets, person characteristics and learning needs of primary care based case managers.","Co-design of the case manager role in a single NHS provider organisation, with external peer review by professionals and carers, in an iterative technology development process.","The generic skills and personal attributes were described for practice nurses taking up the case manager role in their workplaces, and for social workers seconded to general practice teams, together with a method of assessing their learning needs. A manual of information material for people with dementia and their family carers was also created using the US intervention as its source.","Co-design produces rich products that have face validity and map onto the complexities of dementia and of health and care services.

(including memory, language, visuospatial skills and executive function), changes in personality and diminished activities of daily living. The impact of dementia is enormous and poses a huge challenge to patients, their carers, society at large and health systems around the world, in terms of the direct cost of medical care, social care and unpaid care provided by family members and others. In this review, we combine evidence and clinical opinion, using guidelines and reviews from 2006, 2009 and 2010 to present a practical guide for primary care physicians to the diagnosis, treatment and ongoing care of patients with suspected or diagnosed dementia. This review summarises the epidemiology of dementia syndrome, and offers detailed evidence-based advice on recognition of dementia (including subtyping) and responses to it and its associated symptoms. The roles of neuroimaging and biomarkers are discussed, as are both non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies.

England stressed the importance of earlier diagnosis of dementia. In-depth knowledge of the experiences of patients using such services remains an evidence gap.","To increase understanding of the experiences  of people developing dementia and of their carers, to inform practice and decision making.","A retrospective and prospective qualitative interview study of participants recruited from four memory clinics in London, the north-west and the north-east of England.","Purposive sampling was used to recruit 27 individuals with memory problems and 26 supporters and carers. Interviews explored referral pathways, assessment processes, disclosure of the diagnosis, experiences of being prescribed medication to help with symptoms, and issues  of risk and decision making.","Few participants experienced the process of memory assessment as patient centred. Where assessment processes were lengthy and drawn out, participants experienced considerable uncertainty. Many experienced tests and assessments as distressing,  sometimes in settings that were perceived as alarming or potentially stigmatising by association. Information provision and communication were variable and practitioners were not always thought to help people to make sense of their experiences.","The transition  from the early stages of cognitive impairment is not straightforward. There is potentially much uncertainty and waiting. Primary care practitioners may be better able to provide tailored support to individuals and their carers during this time if they are aware of what patients are anticipating  and are informed about the diagnostic 'journey' by the insights of those who have experienced

numbers of people with the condition. Two thirds of people with dementia live at home and policies in many countries seek to support more people for longer in this setting. Incontinence both contributes to carer burden and is also a significant factor in the decision to move into care homes. A review was conducted for evidence of effectiveness for conservative interventions, which are non-pharmacological and non-surgical interventions, for the prevention or management of incontinence in community dwelling people with dementia.","Fourteen electronic databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (from inception to 2012). Assessments of risk of bias were made. Meta-analysis was inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measurements. A narrative analysis was undertaken.","From 427 identified abstracts, 56 studies were examined but only three met the inclusion criteria, all more than a decade old. All three focused on urinary incontinence. Two studies were exploratory or pilot studies. All had a control arm. The interventions were of advice for the carer to implement. Two included toileting education of prompted voiding or an individualised toileting schedule. There was insufficient evidence to support or rule out effectiveness of any of these interventions. Some interventions were unacceptable for some carers. None specifically reported the perspective of the person with dementia.","There was insufficient evidence from any studies to recommend any strategies. There remains an urgent need for both research and also clinical guidance for health professionals tailored to community settings where the majority of people with dementia live."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Drennan","ForeName":"Vari M","Initials":"VM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of

This systematic review evaluates the qualitative evidence about how people accommodate and adapt to the diagnosis of dementia and its immediate consequences, to guide practice.","We systematically reviewed qualitative studies exploring experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia, and their carers, around diagnosis and the transition to becoming a person with dementia. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and the British Nursing Index (all searched in May 2010 with no date restrictions; PubMed search updated in February 2012), checked reference lists, and undertook citation searches in PubMed and Google Scholar (ongoing to September 2011). We used thematic synthesis to identify key themes, commonalities, barriers to earlier diagnosis, and support identified as helpful. We identified 126 papers reporting 102 studies including a total of 3,095 participants. Three overarching themes emerged from our analysis: (1) pathways through diagnosis, including its impact on identity, roles, and relationships; (2) resolving conflicts to accommodate a diagnosis, including the acceptability of support, focusing on the present or the future, and the use or avoidance of knowledge; and (3) strategies and support to minimise the impact of dementia. Consistent barriers to diagnosis include stigma, normalisation of symptoms, and lack of knowledge. Studies report a lack of specialist support particularly post-diagnosis.","There is an extensive body of qualitative literature on the experiences of community-dwelling individuals with dementia on receiving and adapting to a diagnosis of dementia.

Earlier recognition of and response to dementia syndrome is likely to enhance the quality of life of people with dementia, but general practitioners consistently report limited skills and confidence in diagnosis and management of this condition. Changing clinical practice is difficult, and the challenge for those seeking change it is to find ways of working with the grain of professional knowledge and practice. Assessment of educational needs in a practice has the potential to accommodate variations in individual understanding and competence, learning preferences and skill mix. Educational prescriptions identify questions that need to be answered in order to address a clinical problem. This paper reports the development of an educational needs assessment tool to guide tailored educational interventions designed to enhance early diagnosis and management of dementia in primary care, in the Evidence Based Interventions in Dementia in the Community - Early Diagnosis trial.","A multidisciplinary team, including a lay researcher, used an iterative technology development approach to create an educational needs assessment tool, from which educational prescriptions could be written. Workplace learning was tailored to each practice using the educational prescription, and the method was field-tested in five pilot practices.","The educational prescriptions appeared acceptable and useful in volunteer practices. The time commitment (no more than four hours, spread out at the practice's discretion) appeared manageable. The pilot group of practices prioritised diagnosis, assessment of carers' needs, quality markers for dementia care in general practice, and the implications of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) for their clinical practice. The content of the educational needs assessment tool seemed to be comprehensive, in that no new topics were identified by practices in the field trial.","The educational needs assessment tool took into account practitioners' knowledge of the local health and social care systems, reflected the complexity of the diagnostic and care processes for people with dementia, and acknowledged the complexity of the disease process itself."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL, Rowland Hill Street, London NW3 2PF, UK. s.iliffe@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koch","ForeName":"Tamar","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jain","ForeName":"Priya","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lefford","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wong","ForeName":"Geoffrey","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Warner","ForeName":"Alex","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"IPF 11-13","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1005","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"08","Day":"22"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Trials","NlmUniqueID":"101263253","ISSNLinking":"1745-6215"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Health Services","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Medical, Continuing","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Evidence-Based Medicine","QualifierName":["education","methods"]},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Assessment","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Needs Assessment"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Care Team","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2012","Month":"02","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2012","Month":"08","Day":"03"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"4","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22913431","1745-6215-13-142","10.1186\/1745-6215-13-142","PMC3492020"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2001 Nov;5(4):340-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11767982"}},{"Citation":"J Fam Pract. 2001 Oct;50(10):872-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11674890"}},{"Citation":"JAMA. 2003 Apr 16;289(15):1969-75","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12697800"}},{"Citation":"Ann Intern Med. 2003 Jun 3;138(11):927-37","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12779304"}},{"Citation":"Lancet. 2003 Oct 11;362(9391):1225-30","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14568747"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2004 Feb;19(2):151-69","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14758581"}},{"Citation":"Neurol Sci. 2004 Feb;24(6):384-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"14767683"}},{"Citation":"Med J Aust. 2004 Mar 15;180(6 Suppl):S57-60","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15012583"}},{"Citation":"J Healthc Manag. 2004 May-Jun;49(3):155-68;

An unweighted quality-of-care score was constructed using information collected in the annual dementia review, together with pharmacological management of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Multilevel modelling was carried out to identify  factors associated with quality-of-care scores.","In total, 599 out of 745 (80%) patients with dementia had received an annual dementia review; however, a social care review or discussion with carers was evident in just 305 (51%) and 367 (61%) of those 599 cases,  respectively. Despite high prevalence of vascular disease, over a quarter (n = 259, 26%) of all patients with dementia were prescribed antipsychotics; only 57% (n = 148) of these had undergone medication review in the previous 6 months. Those with vascular dementia who were registered  with single-handed practices received poorer quality of care than those registered with practices that had more than one GP.","Although the number of people with dementia with a record of an annual dementia review is high, the quality of these reviews is suboptimal.  The quality score developed in this study could be used as one source of data to identify weaknesses in practice activity that need to be corrected, and so would be of value to commissioners and regulators, as well as practices themselves."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Connolly","ForeName":"Amanda","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Mental

move to a care home. Managing incontinence adds to carer burden and has been reported by family carers as more difficult to manage than behavioural symptoms. Active management strategies have been reported to be associated with less carer depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate carers' perceptions of the range of incontinence problems they helped their relative with and the strategies they employed to manage these.","Family carers of people with dementia living in their own homes were recruited through primary care, specialist community mental health services and voluntary organisations. Qualitative semi structured interviews were conducted either face to face or by telephone and thematically analysed.","Thirty two carers were interviewed. They described a range of problems from supporting the person to remain independent in toileting, through to dealing with inappropriate behaviours, to containing and managing incontinence. All carers actively used problem solving strategies but sometimes these were not acceptable or understood by the person with dementia, particularly as the dementia progressed. Most carers reported protecting the person's dignity by not seeking health professionals help often until the point of a crisis. Once the carer has decided to seek help the responses from health professionals can be less than helpful, and carers report local health service policies on access to continence products to be inconsistent and often inappropriate to their circumstances. A few carers reported strategies for managing toileting and incontinence that have the potential for distress and harm to the person with dementia.","Primary care professionals could be more proactive in enquiry, repeated over time, about toileting and incontinence problems and in giving advice and information to reduce crisis and problems."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Drennan","ForeName":"Vari M","Initials":"VM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health & Social Care Sciences, Kingston University, UK. v.drennan@sgul.kingston.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cole","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1005","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"14"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Geriatr","NlmUniqueID":"100968548","ISSNLinking":"1471-2318"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["psychology","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Fecal Incontinence","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Stigma"},{"DescriptorName":"Taboo","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"},{"DescriptorName":"Urinary Incontinence","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2011","Month":"06","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"11","Day":"16","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2012","Month":"8","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22081876","1471-2318-11-75","10.1186\/1471-2318-11-75","PMC3250935"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Lancet. 2005 Dec 17;366(9503):2112-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16360788"}},{"Citation":"Lancet Neurol. 2008 Sep;7(9):812-26","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18667359"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 1994 Feb;42(2):208-12","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8126338"}},{"Citation":"Neurourol Urodyn. 2010;29(1):165-78","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"20025027"}},{"Citation":"Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord. 2008;26(1):65-78","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18617737"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 1998 Oct;13(10):682-90","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9818303"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 2007 Dec;164(12 Suppl):5-56","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18340692"}},{"Citation":"J Adv Nurs. 2003 Jun;42(6):607-16","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12787234"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 1999 Apr;39(2):177-85","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10224714"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimers Dement. 2007 Apr;3(2):81-91","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19595921"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2008 May;23(5):546-51","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18232054"}},{"Citation":"Age Ageing. 2005 May;34(3):242-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15863409"}},{"Citation":"J Am Geriatr Soc. 2001 Jun;49(6):710-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11454108"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21902772","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"08","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1369-7625","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Dec"}},"Title":"Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Expect"},"ArticleTitle":"The impact of patient and public involvement in the work of the Dementias & Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN): case studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"351-61"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/j.1369-7625.2011.00728.x","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["(i) To describe patient and public involvement (PPI) in a network promoting research in dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, in terms of activity at the different stages of the research cycle and within the different levels of the research network.

PPI allows exploration of feasibility, acceptability and relevance of hypotheses, assists in the precise definition of research questions and increases accrual to studies. However, the measurement of outcomes is methodologically difficult, because the impact of lay researchers may occur through team interactions and be difficult to untangle from the efforts of professional researchers. Opportunities for PPI in rapidly progressive diseases may be limited, and involvement of people with marked cognitive impairment is particularly challenging.","(i) Description of PPI within the DeNDRoN network. (ii) Case studies of three research projects which asked for extra help from centrally organized PPI.","PPI in research projects on the DeNDRoN portfolio may function at different levels, occurring at project, local research network and national level. Case studies of three research projects show different roles for PPI in research and different functions for centrally organized PPI, including contribution to remedial action in studies that are not recruiting to target, solving problems because of the complexity and sensitivity of the research topic, and linking researchers to PPI resources.","The case studies suggest that centrally organized PPI can have 'diagnostic' and remedial functions in studies that are struggling to recruit and serve as reinforcement for study-level PPI in the complex and sensitive research topics that are typical in neurodegenerative diseases research. PPI may be actively sought by researchers, but the infrastructure of PPI is not yet so widespread in the research community that lay researchers are easy to find; a centrally organized PPI resource can assist in this situation."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2011 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Professor, Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL, LondonPPI Co-ordinator, Co-Ordinating Centre, Dementias & Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Network (DeNDRoN), LondonProfessor, Preston MND Care & Research Centre, Royal Preston Hospital, Preston, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McGrath","ForeName":"Terry","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mitchell","ForeName":"Douglas","Initials":"D"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"09","Day":"08"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Expect","NlmUniqueID":"9815926","ISSNLinking":"1369-6513"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":[{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Indans"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Nootropic Agents"},{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Piperidines"},{"RegistryNumber":"8SSC91326P","NameOfSubstance":"Donepezil"},{"RegistryNumber":"W8O17SJF3T","NameOfSubstance":"Memantine"}]},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Biomedical Research","QualifierName":["methods","organization & administration"]},{"DescriptorName":"Community Participation","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Donepezil"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Indans","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Memantine","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Neurodegenerative Diseases","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Nootropic Agents","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"},{"DescriptorName":"Organizational Case Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Participation","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Piperidines","QualifierName":"therapeutic use"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["neurodegenerative diseases","patient and public involvement","research networks"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"9","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"8","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21902772","10.1111\/j.1369-7625.2011.00728.x","PMC5060691"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Health Expect. 2004 Sep;7(3):209-20","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15327460"}},{"Citation":"Lancet. 2002 Jan 12;359(9301):164-5","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11809284"}},{"Citation":"Int J Qual Health Care. 2008 Dec;20(6):373-4","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18836184"}},{"Citation":"Clin Trials. 2006;3(1):19-30","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16539087"}},{"Citation":"Health Policy. 2010 Apr;95(1):10-23","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19963299"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 2001 Mar 3;322(7285):519-23","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11230065"}},{"Citation":"Eur J Cancer. 2006 Oct;42(15):2454-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16904311"}},{"Citation":"Qual Health Res. 2005 Dec;15(10):1310-28","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16263914"}},{"Citation":"Health Serv Res. 1999 Dec;34(5 Pt 2):1209-24","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10591280"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"21801564","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"10","Day":"17"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"08"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1478-5242","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"61","Issue":"589","PubDate":{"Year":"2011","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners","ISOAbbreviation":"Br J Gen Pract"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia diagnosis and management: a narrative review of changing practice.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e513-25"},"ELocationID":"10.3399\/bjgp11X588493","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Early detection and management of dementia in primary care are difficult problems for practitioners.

The criterion for inclusion was that studies had to be of interventions aimed at improving detection or management of dementia in primary care. Exclusion criteria included studies in non-English publications, pharmacological interventions, and screening instrument studies. Quality was assessed using the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale.","Fifteen studies were identified, of which 11 were randomised controlled trials. Eight reported educational interventions, and seven trialled service redesign, either by changing the service pathway or by introducing case management. Educationally, only facilitated sessions and decision-support software improved GPs' diagnosis of dementia, as did trials of service-pathway modification. Some of the case-management trials showed improved stakeholder satisfaction, decreased symptoms, and care that was more concordant with guidelines.","The quality of the studies varied considerably. Educational interventions are effective when learners are able to set their own educational agenda.

Such under-representation biases estimates of absolute effect, absolute harm and cost-effectiveness. Research on dementia should include patient populations that more exactly reflect the population at risk. One of the impediments to this is the lack of a suitable tool for identification of patients suitable for studies. CONSTRUCTION & CONTENTS: A technology development methodology was used to develop a registry of people with dementia and their carers. This involved phases of modelling and prototype creation, 'bench testing' the prototype with experts and then 'field testing' the refined prototype in exemplar sites. The evaluation of the field testing described here is based on a case study methodology. UTILITY: This case study suggests that construction and population of a dementia research registry is feasible, but initial development is complex because of the ethical and organisational difficulties. Recruitment from primary care is particularly costly in terms of staff time and only identifies a very small number of people with dementia who were not already known to specialist services. Recruiting people with dementia through secondary care is a resource intensive process that takes up to six months to complete. Identifying the components of a minimum dataset was easy but its usefulness for pre-screening potential research populations has yet to be established. Acceptance rates are very high in the first clinic to recruit to the registry, but this may reflect the efforts of registry 'champions'.","Easier recruitment may perpetuate potential selection biases and we are not yet able to assess the representativeness of the research-ready population recruited to the registry. The need to recruit from wider populations, through primary and social care, remains. The success of this registry will be measured by the proportion of people from it who are recruited to research projects, and its impact on overall accrual to studies."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research

systems, resulting in delayed recognition and adverse outcomes for patients and their carers. Improving its early detection is an area identified for development in the English National Dementia Strategy 2009; there are thought to be multiple benefits to the patient, family, and resources by doing this. The aim of this review was to carry out a rapid appraisal in order to inform the implementation of this policy.","Publications in English up to August 2009 relating to barriers to the recognition of dementia, were identified by a broad search strategy, using electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and psycINFO. Exclusion criteria included non-English language, studies about pharmacological interventions or screening instruments, and settings without primary care.","Eleven empirical studies were found: 3 quantitative, 6 qualitative, and 2 with mixed methodologies. The main themes from the qualitative studies were found to be lack of support, time constraints, financial constraints, stigma, diagnostic uncertainty, and disclosing the diagnosis. Quantitative studies yielded diverse results about knowledge, service support, time constraints, and confidence. The factors identified in qualitative and quantitative studies were grouped into 3 categories: patient factors, GP factors and system characteristics.","Much can still be done in the way of service development and provision, GP training and education, and the eradication of stigma attached to dementia, to improve the early detection and management of dementia. Implementation of dementia strategies should include attention to all three categories of barriers. Further research should focus on their interaction, using different methods from studies to date."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koch","ForeName":"Tamar","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary Care & Population Health, University College London, Royal Free & University College Medical School, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK. t.koch@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"CollectiveName":"EVIDEM-ED project"}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1005","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"07","Day":"01"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"BMC Fam Pract","NlmUniqueID":"100967792","ISSNLinking":"1471-2296"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"45"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2010","Month":"05","Day":"04"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2010","Month":"07","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"7","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"7","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"8","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20594302","1471-2296-11-52","10.1186\/1471-2296-11-52","PMC2909966"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Patient Educ Couns. 2000 Feb;39(2-3):219-25","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11040721"}},{"Citation":"Fam Pract. 2007 Apr;24(2):108-16","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17237496"}},{"Citation":"Br J Gen Pract. 2001 Jan;51(462):37-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11271871"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 2001 Aug 4;323(7307):275-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11485961"}},{"Citation":"Scand J Prim Health Care. 2001 Sep;19(3):194-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11697565"}},{"Citation":"Fam Pract. 2003 Aug;20(4):376-81","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12876106"}},{"Citation":"Age Ageing. 2004 Sep;33(5):461-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15271637"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2004 Sep;8(5):422-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15511740"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 1988 Oct 29;297(6656):1107-10","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"3143447"}},{"Citation":"South Med J. 1996 Jan;89(1):1-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8545685"}},{"Citation":"Br J Gen Pract. 1994 Sep;44(386):405-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8790653"}},{"Citation":"Psychol Med. 1996 Sep;26(5):1061-74","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8878338"}},{"Citation":"Dementia. 1996 Nov-Dec;7(6):293-303","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8915035"}},{"Citation":"Psychol Med. 1996 Nov;26(6):1223-30","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8931168"}},{"Citation":"Neurology. 1999 Apr 12;52(6):1138-45","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10214734"}},{"Citation":"Theor Med Bioeth. 1999 Jun;20(3):215-28","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10474309"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 1999 Aug;39(4):457-64","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10495584"}},{"Citation":"J Gen Intern Med. 2007 Nov;22(11):1487-92","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17823840"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2008 Jul;23(7):663-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18229882"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2008 Sep;12(5):568-76","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"18855172"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 2009;339:b2535","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19622551"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2009 Sep;24(9):895-901","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"19226529"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Jan;9(1):1-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15841826"}},{"Citation":"Fam Pract. 2006 Jun;23(3):353-62","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16461450"}},{"Citation":"BMC Med Res Methodol. 2006;6:35","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16872487"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2007 Jan;22(1):47-54","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"17044135"}},{"Citation":"Am J Manag Care. 2000 Dec;6(22 Suppl):S1111-8;

However, research has traditionally focused on treating cognitive symptoms, thus neglecting core clinical symptoms that often have a more profound impact on living with dementia. Recent evidence (Kales et al, 2007; Ballard et al, 2009) indicates that the popular approach to managing BPSD - prescription of anti-psychotic medication - can increase mortality and the risk of stroke in people with dementia as well as impair quality of life and accelerate cognitive decline. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate the impact that non-pharmacological interventions have on BPSD; we believe physical exercise is a particularly promising approach.","We will carry out a pragmatic, randomised, single-blind controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise (planned walking) on the behavioural and psychological symptoms of individuals with dementia. We aim to recruit 146 people with dementia and their carers to be randomized into two groups; one will be trained in a structured, tailored walking programme, while the other will continue with treatment as usual. The primary outcome (BPSD) will be assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) along with relevant secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.","Designing this study has been challenging both ethically and methodologically. In particular to design an intervention that is simple, measurable, safe, non-invasive and enjoyable has been testing and has required a lot of thought. Throughout the design, we have attempted to balance methodological rigour with study feasibility.

and management skills in dementia. Early diagnosis in dementia within primary care is important as this allows those with dementia and their family care networks to engage with support services and plan for the future. There is, however, evidence that dementia remains under-detected and sub-optimally managed in general practice. An earlier unblinded, cluster randomised controlled study tested the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving detection rates and management of dementia in primary care. In this original trial, a computer decision support system and practice-based educational workshops were effective in improving rates of detecting dementia although not in changing clinical management. The challenge therefore is to find methods of changing clinical management. Our aim in this new trial is to test a customised educational intervention developed for general practice, promoting both earlier diagnosis and concordance with management guidelines.","The customised educational intervention combines practice-based workshops and electronic support material. Its effectiveness will be tested in an unblinded cluster randomised controlled trial with a pre-post intervention design, with two arms; normal care versus the educational intervention. Twenty primary care practices have been recruited with the aim of gaining 200 patient participants. We will examine whether the intervention is effective, pragmatic and feasible within the primary care setting. Our primary outcome measure is an increase in the proportion of patients with dementia who receive at least two dementia-specific management reviews per year. We will also examine important secondary outcomes such as practice concordance with management guidelines and benefits to patients and carers in terms of quality of life and carer strain.","The EVIDEM-ED trial builds on the earlier study but the intervention is different in that it is specifically customised to the educational needs of each practice. If this trial is successful it could have implications for the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy.","NCT00866099."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, UK. s.iliffe@ucl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffin","ForeName":"Mark","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jain","ForeName":"Priya","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thun\u00e9-Boyle","ForeName":"Ingela","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Koch","ForeName":"Tamar","Initials":"T"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lefford","ForeName":"Frances","Initials":"F"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ClinicalTrials.gov","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"NCT00866099"}}},"GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1005","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"02","Day":"10"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Trials","NlmUniqueID":"101263253","ISSNLinking":"1745-6215"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Support Systems, Clinical"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Support Techniques"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Early Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Education, Medical, Continuing"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Evidence-Based Medicine"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Guideline Adherence"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Guidelines as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Practice Patterns, Physicians'"},{"DescriptorName":"Predictive Value of Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Research Design"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":"etiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2009","Month":"12","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2010","Month":"02","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"2","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"2","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"5","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20146803","1745-6215-11-13","10.1186\/1745-6215-11-13","PMC2829558"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Stat Med. 1999 Oct 15;18(19):2605-15","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10495459"}},{"Citation":"Med J Aust. 2004 Mar 15;180(6 Suppl):S57-60","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15012583"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 2006 Mar 25;332(7543):692-6","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16565124"}},{"Citation":"J Clin Epidemiol. 2004 Aug;57(8):785-94","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15485730"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 1999 May 8;318(7193):A","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10231294"}},{"Citation":"Soc Sci Med. 2001 Jun;52(12):1889-901","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11352414"}},{"Citation":"BMJ. 1999 May 8;318(7193):1267-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10231262"}},{"Citation":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2005;(3):CD005470","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16034980"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"19946862","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2011","Month":"01","Day":"28"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1099-1166","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"25","Issue":"7","PubDate":{"Year":"2010","Month":"Jul"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Primary care and dementia: 2.

Dementia is probably under-diagnosed and under treated with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary care physicians. This problem of under-diagnosis is probably not due to lack of diagnostic skills, but rather to the interaction of case-complexity, pressure on time and the negative effects of reimbursement systems. Primary care physicians often over-estimate the prevalence of dementia syndromes, but in some countries may also overestimate the prevalence of vascular dementia compared with Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosis is a step-wise process which can be aided by use of a cognitive function test, of which there are a number suitable for primary care use. Evidence based practice protocols can enhance detection rates in primary care, and there is growing evidence that communication skills in talking to people with dementia about dementia can be improved. Nevertheless there are multiple obstacles to bringing recognition forward in time, both in public awareness and professional understanding of the early changes in dementia.","There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify population screening in primary care but earlier recognition of people with dementia syndrome is possible within primary care. The diagnosis of dementia is a shared responsibility between generalist and specialist disciplines. Primary care physicians should explore patients' ideas and concerns around their symptoms prior to referral and tentatively discuss possible diagnoses. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the primary care physician should provide both practical and emotional support to allow the patient and their family to come to terms with living with dementia, and refer them for additional psychosocial support if required."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

been little studied. Hawthorne Effects have been reported in previous clinical trials in dementia but to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to quantify them. Our aim was to compare minimal follow-up to intensive follow-up in participants in a placebo controlled trial of Ginkgo biloba for treating mild-moderate dementia.","Participants in a dementia trial were randomised to intensive follow-up (with comprehensive assessment visits at baseline and two, four and six months post randomisation) or minimal follow-up (with an abbreviated assessment at baseline and a full assessment at six months). Our primary outcomes were cognitive functioning (ADAS-Cog) and participant and carer-rated quality of life (QOL-AD).","We recruited 176 participants, mainly through general practices. The main analysis was based on Intention to treat (ITT), with available data. In the ANCOVA model with baseline score as a co-variate, follow-up group had a significant effect on outcome at six months on the ADAS-Cog score (n = 140; mean difference = -2.018; 95%CI -3.914, -0.121; p = 0.037 favouring the intensive follow-up group), and on participant-rated quality of life score (n = 142; mean difference = -1.382; 95%CI -2.642, -0.122; p = 0.032 favouring minimal follow-up group). There was no significant difference on carer quality of life.","We found that more intensive follow-up of individuals in a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Ginkgo biloba for treating mild-moderate dementia resulted in a better outcome than minimal follow-up, as measured by their cognitive functioning.","Current controlled trials:

This stance contains lessons for designers of trials, drug regulators, health economists and those developing clinical guidelines for dementia care. The debates that took place around and within NICE were about identifying the benefits of these medicines and the beneficiaries, clarifying the costs of the medication and whom bears them, the methods of weighing benefit against cost, and the consequences of using different approaches to cost-benefit analysis. This article discusses each of these themes and outlines the changes in research and clinical practice and policy making that might flow from NICE's decisions on medication use. Outcome measures that capture changes in dementia syndromes need further development. Cost-benefit analysis needs refinement with better tools than quality-adjusted life-years, and the policy implications of restricting treatments in a progressive neurodegenerative disorder need more careful consideration."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University College London, London, England. s.iliffe@pcps.ucl.ac.uk"}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"CNS Drugs","NlmUniqueID":"9431220","ISSNLinking":"1172-7047"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Academies and Institutes"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["drug therapy","economics"]},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Drug Costs"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Patients"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"3","Day":"7","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"5","Day":"3","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"3","Day":"7","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17338591","2131","10.2165\/00023210-200721030-00001"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"BMJ. 2004 Jul 24;329(7459):224-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15271836"}},{"Citation":"Neurology. 2000;54(11 Suppl 5):S4-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10854354"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2004 Nov;19(11):1026-34","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15481077"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2006 Jan;21(1):9-13","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16353164"}},{"Citation":"Neurology. 2001 Aug 14;57(3):481-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11502917"}},{"Citation":"Health Technol Assess. 2005 Mar;9(10 ):1-93, iii-iv","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15774233"}},{"Citation":"Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord. 1997;11 Suppl 3:8-18","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9305508"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2006 Jan;21(1):6-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16353163"}},{"Citation":"J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2004 May;75(5):677-85","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15090558"}},{"Citation":"J Psychosom Res. 2006 Sep;61(3):327-33","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16938510"}},{"Citation":"Med Care. 2001 Aug;39(8):760-71","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11468496"}},{"Citation":"Health Trends. 1993;25(1):31-7","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10171428"}},{"Citation":"N Engl J Med. 2003 Apr 3;348(14):1333-41","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12672860"}},{"Citation":"Neurology. 2001 Aug 14;57(3):489-95","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11502918"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2000 Oct;15(10):947-53","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11044877"}},{"Citation":"Neurology. 2000 Jun 27;54(12):2261-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10881250"}},{"Citation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 1997 Aug;12(8):841-56","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"9283930"}}]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17060346","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"01","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"09","Day":"22"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0269-8811","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"J Psychopharmacol"},"ArticleTitle":"Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: a consensus statement from British Association for Psychopharmacology.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"732-55"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) coordinated a meeting of experts to review the evidence on the drug treatment for dementia. The level of evidence (types) was rated using a standard system: Types 1a and 1b (evidence from meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials or at least one controlled trial respectively); types 2a and 2b (one well-designed study or one other type of quasi experimental study respectively); type 3 (non-experimental descriptive studies); and type 4 (expert opinion). There is type 1a evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease; and for the use of bright light therapy and aromatherapy. There is type 1a evidence of no effect of anti inflammatory drugs or statins. There is conflicting evidence regarding oestrogens, with type 2a evidence of a protective effect of oestrogens but 1b evidence of a harmful effect. Type 1a evidence for any effect of B12 and folate will be forthcoming when current trials report. There is type 1b evidence for gingko biloba in producing a modest benefit of cognitive function; cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of people with Lewy body disease (particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms); cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in treatment cognitive impairment associated with vascular dementia; and the effect of metal collating agents (although these should not be prescribed until more data on safety and efficacy are available). There is type 1b evidence to show that neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor vitamin E reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment; and there is no evidence that there is any intervention that can prevent the onset of dementia. There is type 1b evidence for the beneficial effects of adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, and type 2b evidence of positive switching outcomes from one cholinesterase inhibitor to another. There is type 2a evidence for a positive effect of reminiscence therapy, and type 2a evidence that cognitive training does not work. There is type 3 evidence to support the use of psychological interventions in dementia. There is type 2 evidence that a clinical diagnosis of dementia can be made accurately and that brain imaging increases that accuracy. Although the consensus statement dealt largely with medication, the role of dementia care in secondary services (geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry) and primary care, along with health economics, was discussed. There is ample evidence that there are effective treatments for people with dementia, and Alzheimer's disease in particular. Patients, their carers, and clinicians deserve to be optimistic in a field which often attracts therapeutic nihilism."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Burns","ForeName":"Alistair","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University

Stigma in ageing and dementia, accompanied by a sense that there is little to offer until later on in the disease, underpinned the widespread reluctance of GPs to recognise dementia at an early stage and were major obstacles to the timely diagnosis of dementia across all eight countries. Dementia care services varied widely across Europe. Countries with the greatest development of dementia health care services were characterised by national guidelines, GPs fulfilling a gatekeeper function, multi-disciplinary memory clinics and innovative programmes that stimulated practice and new services. Dementia-related stigma was perceived as being less prominent in these countries.","Overcome of delays in the timely diagnosis of dementia needs more than specialist services.

The main difficulties identified by general practitioners were talking with patients about the diagnosis, responding to behaviour problems and coordinating support services. General practitioners perceived lack of time and lack of social services support as the major obstacles to good quality care more often than they identified their own unfamiliarity with current management or with local resources. Attitudes to the disclosure of the diagnosis, and to the potential for improving the quality of life of patients and carers varied, but a third of general practitioners believed that dementia care is within a specialist's domain, not that of general practice. More experienced and male general practitioners were more pessimistic about dementia care, as were general practitioners with lower knowledge about dementia. Those reporting greater difficulty with dementia diagnosis and management and those with lower knowledge scores were also less likely to express attitudes endorsing open communication with patient and carer.","Educational support for general practitioners should concentrate on epidemiological knowledge, disclosure of the diagnosis and management of behaviour problems in dementia.

older person newly diagnosed with dementia. It draws on professional perspectives derived from a series of 24 multidisciplinary workshops held in the UK, analysed using a typology developed by Twigg in 1989. The primary care workers' understanding of carers' needs and circumstances fitted best with Twigg's models of carers as resources and co-workers, but showed limited awareness of carers' responses and attitudes to caring. It is argued that professional assumptions about family members' roles when dementia is recently recognised among older people expand definitions of carers, but still confirm their instrumental role."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workforce Research Unit, King's College, London, UK. jill.manthrope@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eden","ForeName":"Alison","Initials":"A"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Health Soc Care Community","NlmUniqueID":"9306359","ISSNLinking":"0966-0410"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing","QualifierName":"classification"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Theoretical"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Family Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"25","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"1","Day":"21","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"25","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["14629578","453","10.1046\/j.1365-2524.2003.00453.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"14521684","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"08","Day":"17"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0309-2402","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"44","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2003","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Journal of advanced nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"J Adv Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Early recognition of dementia by nurses.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"183-91"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Early recognition of dementia is a key policy objective designed to maximize the efficacy of treatment and to provide timely and appropriate support before crisis occurs. The impact of early recognition of dementia is under-researched in primary care nursing.","To explore whether community mental health nurses (CMHNs), community nurses (CNs) and practice nurses (PNs) have different perspectives on early diagnosis of dementia and to consider the possible effects of any variation.","Data are drawn from questionnaires completed by CMHNs (79), CNs (153) and PNs (36) who attended workshops offered on 24 occasions in 21 settings across the United Kingdom. The workshops attracted a range of primary care practitioners and were part of a training programme on early diagnosis of dementia.","Analysis of the data shows some differences in knowledge, experience and confidence between the three nurse groups. CMHNs were more confident in their abilities to recognize dementia and found providing support less difficult than CNs and PNs. CMHNs considered that they were best placed to co-ordinate services for people with newly recognized dementia. CNs and PNs, however, reported experience of working with people with dementia and many appeared able to respond to early signs and to identify potential sources of support.","While CMHNs may have a key role in responding effectively to the newly identified needs of people with early dementia, other nurses working in the community are likely to encounter people with early dementia. In the context of a policy objective to identify people with dementia earlier, all community-based nurses should be able to recognize the possibility of dementia and support those undergoing referral or assessment. Their confidence in doing so should be enhanced by continued professional development. Training in dementia recognition, involvement in and membership of primary care teams supporting people with dementia should not be confined to CMHNs. Nurses who regularly encounter the general population of older people may be well placed to provide continuity of support for those who may, or may not, have cause to suspect that they or their relatives have early dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Manthorpe","ForeName":"Jill","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Social Care Workfore Research Unit, King's College London, London, UK. jill.manthorpe@kcl.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Eden","ForeName":"Alison","Initials":"A"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Adv Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"7609811","ISSNLinking":"0309-2402"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Health Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse Practitioners"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse's Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"3","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"5","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"10","Day":"3","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["14521684","2782","10.1046\/j.1365-2648.2003.02782.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"14512859","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"11","Day":"19"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0966-0461","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"12","Issue":"17","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2003 Sep 25-Oct 8"}},"Title":"British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)","ISOAbbreviation":"Br J Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"An exploratory survey into primary care nurses and dementia care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1029-37"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"This article introduces findings from the first phase of a randomized controlled trial of educational interventions in primary care. The focus of the article is the knowledge, attitudes and confidence of primary care nursing staff to the diagnosis and ongoing management of dementia. A total 78 nurses with a mean age of 46.4 years and a mean time since qualification of 23.0 years were recruited in 36 practices in central Scotland and in London. Disciplines represented by this sample were predominantly district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses and community staff nurses. Each practitioner was administered an extensive self-completion questionnaire before the educational interventions were introduced to measure baseline knowledge, confidence and perceived difficulties in dementia care management and attitudes. Results from the quiz indicate lower levels of knowledge about epidemiology and diagnosis, but slightly higher levels about management strategies. Self-reported ratings of confidence were also low and were directly related to ratings of difficulty in identifying dementia and dealing with coexisting behavioural and mental health problems. Lower scores on all domains were recorded for practice nurses than for district nurses or health visitors."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bryans","ForeName":"Michelle","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Keady","ForeName":"John","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Turner","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilcock","ForeName":"Jane","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Clinical Trial","Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Br J Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9212059","ISSNLinking":"0966-0461"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Clinical Competence","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse's Role"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurses","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Education Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Staff","QualifierName":["education","psychology","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2003","Month":"07","Day":"01"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2004","Month":"2","Day":"5","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"9","Day":"27","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["14512859","10.12968\/bjon.2003.12.17.11723"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12876106","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"12","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0263-2136","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2003","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"Family practice","ISOAbbreviation":"Fam Pract"},"ArticleTitle":"Sooner or later?
