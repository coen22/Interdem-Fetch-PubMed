Care at home often breaks down, necessitating transition to a care home and existing interventions are limited. To inform the development of psychosocial interventions to enable people with dementia to live well for longer at home, we qualitatively explored the views of people living with dementia, family carers and health and social care professionals, on how to achieve and maintain independence at home and what impedes this.","We conducted an inductive thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with 11 people living with dementia, 19 professionals and 22 family carers in England.","We identified four overarching themes: being in a safe and familiar environment, enabling not disabling care, maintaining relationships and community connectedness, and getting the right support. For people living with dementia, the realities of staying active were complex: there was a tension between accepting support that enabled independence and a feeling that in doing so they were accepting dependency. Their and professionals' accounts prioritised autonomy and 'living well with dementia', while family carers prioritised avoiding harm. Professionals promoted positive risk-taking and facilitating independence, whereas family carers often felt they were left holding this risk.","Psychosocial interventions must accommodate tensions between positive risk-taking and avoiding harm, facilitating autonomy and providing support. They should be adaptive and collaborative, combining self-management with flexible support. Compassionate implementation of rights-based dementia care must consider the emotional burden for family carers of supporting someone to live positively with risk."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rapaport","ForeName":"Penny","Initials":"P","Identifier":"0000-0003-0479-6950","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"University College London, London, UK.

The transition between hospitals and care homes is an area of documented poor care leading to adverse outcomes including costly re-hospitalisation. This review aims to understand the experiences and outcomes of care for people living with dementia who undergo this transition from the perspectives of key stakeholders; people living with dementia, their families and health care professionals.","A systematic search was conducted on the CINAHL, ASSIA, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Scopus databases without any date restrictions. We hand searched reference lists of included papers. Papers were included if they focused on people living with dementia moving from hospital to a short or long term care setting in the community including sub-acute, rehabilitation, skilled nursing facilities or care homes. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened. Two authors independently evaluated study quality using a checklist. Themes were identified and discussed to reach consensus.","In total, nine papers reporting eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. A total of 257 stakeholders participated; 37 people living with dementia, 95 family members, and 125 health and social care professionals.

the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 to enable person-centred care for people with dementia and their carers (DCM-EPIC) in care homes: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"300"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s13063-016-1416-z","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Up to 90 % of people living with dementia in care homes experience one or more behaviours that staff may describe as challenging to support (BSC). Of these agitation is the most common and difficult to manage. The presence of agitation is associated with fewer visits from relatives, poorer quality of life and social isolation. It is recommended that agitation is treated through psychosocial interventions. Dementia Care Mapping\u2122 (DCM\u2122) is an established, widely used observational tool and practice development cycle, for ensuring a systematic approach to providing person-centred care. There is a body of practice-based literature and experience to suggests that DCM\u2122 is potentially effective but limited robust evidence for its effectiveness, and no examination of its cost-effectiveness, as a UK health care intervention. Therefore, a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of DCM\u2122 in the UK is urgently needed.","A pragmatic, multi-centre, cluster-randomised controlled trial of Dementia Care Mapping (DCM\u2122) plus Usual Care (UC) versus UC alone, where UC is the normal care delivered within the care home following a minimum level of dementia awareness training. The trial will take place in residential, nursing and dementia-specialist care homes across West Yorkshire, Oxfordshire and London, with residents with dementia. A random sample of 50 care homes will be selected within which a minimum of 750 residents will be registered. Care homes will be randomised in an allocation ratio of 3:2 to receive either intervention or control. Outcome measures will be obtained at 6 and 16 months following randomisation. The primary outcome is agitation as measured by the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, at 16 months post randomisation. Key secondary outcomes are other BSC and quality of life. There will be an integral cost-effectiveness analysis and a process evaluation.","The protocol was refined following a pilot of trial procedures. Changes include replacement of a questionnaire, whose wording caused some residents distress, to an adapted version specifically designed for use in care homes, a change to the randomisation stratification factors, adaption in how the staff measures are collected to encourage greater compliance, and additional reminders to intervention homes of when mapping cycles are due, via text message.","Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82288852 .

practitioners described lack of reciprocity as one way in which people with dementia are perceived within society. This was closely linked to their perception of dementia as a stigma. In this article, we explore whether general practitioners perceive people with dementia as lacking reciprocity and, if so, if this is linked with societal opinions about dementia as a stigma. The implications of both perceptions of people with dementia failing to reciprocate and of stigma for timely diagnosis are explored. Our approach is to follow the thread of reciprocity in the data from our initial study. In this follow-up study, general practitioners' perceptions of societal views of people with dementia included a perception of a lack of reciprocity specifically linked with; failing to respond to human contact, the absence of an appropriate return on social investment and failing to contribute to, or being a burden on, society. General practitioners reported a link between societal perceptions of lack of reciprocity and stereotypes about advanced dementia, difficulties communicating with people with dementia, and lack of opportunities for people with dementia to reciprocate. General practitioners occupy a key position, they can challenge stereotypes and, with support and targeted training about communicating with people living with dementia, can emphasize the ways in which people with dementia can communicate, thereby enhancing their potential to reciprocate. Such changes have implications for improved care and quality of life through the continued maintenance of social inclusion and perceptions of personhood."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gove","ForeName":"Dianne","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Europe, Luxembourg."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Small","ForeName":"Neil","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bradford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Radboud University Medical Centre, The Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"01","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Follow-Up Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"General Practitioners","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Stigma"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","general practitioners and perceptions","reciprocity","stigma"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26759447","1471301215625657","10.1177\/1471301215625657"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26554996","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"01","Day":"30"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"01","Day":"30"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2047-9018","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"30","Issue":"11","PubDate":{"Year":"2015","Month":"Nov","Day":"11"}},"Title":"Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987)","ISOAbbreviation":"Nurs Stand"},"ArticleTitle":"Person-centred communication in dementia care.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"37-41"},"ELocationID":"10.7748\/ns.30.11.37.s45","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Communication involves the exchange of information between at least two people, a giver and a receiver. If left unaddressed, communication difficulties may have a profound effect on quality of life and quality of care. Poor communication may result in high levels of anxiety and depression for the person living with dementia. Communication breakdown contributes to high rates of depression in spouses of people living with dementia and is a major problem for family and carers. Positive and supportive communication is essential to ensure good quality dementia care. A person-centred approach focuses on supporting a person to use and retain their skills and abilities. Person-centred communication involves a commitment to including the perspective of the person living with dementia, and an understanding of who the person is, their life history and preferences.

DCM yields a count and detailed description of staff-resident interactions that either address (personal enhancers - PEs) or undermine (personal detractions - PDs) residents' psychological needs, and every 5-minute scores for each resident's mood and engagement (ME-value). The relationship between PEs and PDs and well-being was analysed by studying residents' ME-values before and three time frames after a PE or PD occurred.","A total of 76 PEs and 33 PDs were observed. The most common PEs were those addressing psychological needs for comfort and occupation. However residents' well-being increased most often after PEs that addressed residents' need for identity, attachment and inclusion. The most common PDs were those which undermined the need for comfort, inclusion and occupation.

Although transitional care has received increasing attention in the health care arena, no widely accepted transitions typology exists for the dementia journey. At the same time, national dementia strategies are proliferating. We developed a typology containing six transitions that cover the dementia journey from symptom recognition to end-of-life care. We then critically evaluated whether and how the national dementia strategies of Australia, England, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, and the United States addressed each transition. Adopting a person-centered perspective, we found that most or all of the national strategies adequately address earlier transitions in the journey, but fewer strategies address the later transitions. We recommend that next-generation national dementia strategies focus on later transitions, specify how care coordination and workforce training should make transitions more person centered, and use person-centered outcomes in evaluating the success of the strategies' implementation and dissemination.

We developed an observational tool, AwareCare, which care staff can use to identify signs of awareness in residents with very severe dementia, based on the concept of the Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM). Using WHIM items as a guide, and following focus groups with care staff and family members, an expert panel identified 28 environmental stimuli and 35 response categories for the initial version of AwareCare. After baseline assessments of cognition, well-being and quality of life were taken, 40 residents were observed individually for 30 minutes on 5 occasions. Based on the observational data, 10 stimulus categories and 14 response categories were identified for further analysis and formed the final version of AwareCare. All participants showed awareness to varying degrees. Social stimuli elicited the most responses. Greater awareness was associated with better cognitive function, self-care, mobility, and responsiveness, but not with proxy-rated quality of life.

Multi-component, tailor-made psychosocial interventions are considered to be particularly promising (Brodaty 2003; Spijker 2008). These interventions involve multiple mechanisms of action. In this review we focused solely on the effectiveness of one element within psychosocial interventions, cognitive reframing. Cognitive reframing is a component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In dementia care, cognitive reframing interventions focus on family carers' maladaptive, self-defeating or distressing cognitions about their relatives' behaviors and about their own performance in the caring role.","The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive reframing interventions for family carers of people with dementia on their psychological morbidity and stress.","The trials were identified by searching (5 April 2009) the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, which contains records from major healthcare databases: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS, ongoing trial databases and grey literature sources. For more detailed information on what the Group's specialized register contains and to view the search strategies see the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group methods used in reviews.The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources were also searched separately on 5 April 2009.","Randomised controlled trials of cognitive reframing interventions for family carers of people with dementia.","Three assessors (MVD, ID, JmC) independently judged whether the intervention being studied was documented in a trial; two assessors assessed trial quality.","Pooled data indicated a beneficial effect of cognitive reframing interventions on carers' psychological morbidity, specifically anxiety (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.04), depression (SMD -0.66; 95% CI -1.27 to -0.05), and subjective stress (SMD -0.23; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.04). No effects were found for carers' coping, appraisal of the burden, reactions to their relatives' behaviors, or institutionalization of the person with dementia.","Cognitive reframing for family carers of people with dementia seems to reduce psychological morbidity and subjective stress but without altering appraisals of coping or burden. The results suggest that it may be an effective component of individualised, multi-component interventions for carers. Identifying studies with relevant interventions was a challenge for this review. The impact of cognitive reframing might be higher when used alongside other interventions because this offers better opportunities to tailor cognitive reframing to actual everyday carer problems."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Quality of Care Research\/Alzheimer Center, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands.

One reason for this may be the assumption that people with severe dementia are unaware of what is happening to them. However, there is converging evidence to suggest that global assumptions of unawareness are inappropriate. This trial platform study aims to assist care staff in perceiving and responding to subtle signs of awareness and thus enhance their practice.","In Stage One, a measure of awareness in severe dementia will be developed. Two focus groups and an expert panel will contribute to item and scale development. In Stage Two observational data will be used to further develop the measure. Working in four care homes, we will recruit 40 individuals with severe dementia who have no, or very limited, verbal communication. Data on inter-rater reliability and frequency of all items and exploratory factor analysis will be used to identify items to be retained. Test-retest and inter-rater reliability for the new measure will be calculated. Correlations with scores for well-being and behaviour and with proxy ratings of quality of life will provide an indication of concurrent validity. In Stage Three the new measure will be used in a single blind cluster randomised trial. Eight care homes will participate, with 10 residents recruited in each giving a total sample of 80 people with severe dementia. Homes will be randomised to intervention or usual care conditions. In the intervention condition, staff will receive training in using the new measure and will undertake observations of designated residents. For residents with dementia, outcomes will be assessed in terms of change from baseline in scores for behaviour, well-being and quality of life. For care staff, outcomes will be assessed in terms of change from baseline in scores for attitudes, care practice, and well-being.","The results will inform the design of a larger-scale trial intended to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of increasing the sensitivity of care staff to signs of awareness in residents with severe dementia.","ISRCTN59507580 http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clare","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Psychology, Bangor University, Gwynedd LL57 2AS, UK. l.clare@bangor.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Woods","ForeName":"Robert T","Initials":"RT"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Whitaker","ForeName":"Rhiannon","Initials":"R"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilson","ForeName":"Barbara A","Initials":"BA"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN59507580"}}},"GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"GrantID":"G0701817","Agency":"Medical Research Council","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"06","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Trials","NlmUniqueID":"101263253","ISSNLinking":"1745-6215"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication Barriers"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Nurse-Patient Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Residential Facilities","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Single-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Staff Development","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2010","Month":"04","Day":"21"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2010","Month":"06","Day":"25"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2010","Month":"6","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2010","Month":"6","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"9","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"epublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["20579370","1745-6215-11-73","10.1186\/1745-6215-11-73","PMC2908603"]},"ReferenceList":{"Reference":[{"Citation":"Age Ageing. 1993 May;22(3):183-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"8503314"}},{"Citation":"Am J Psychiatry. 1982 Sep;139(9):1136-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"7114305"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Nov;9(6):535-41","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16214701"}},{"Citation":"Int J Nurs Stud. 1991;28(1):65-75","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"1856035"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Sep;9(5):394-413","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16024399"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2005 Oct;45 Spec No 1(1):133-46","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16230760"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2005 Oct;45 Spec No 1(1):96-105","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16230756"}},{"Citation":"J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci. 1999 May;54(3):P180-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"10363040"}},{"Citation":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2002 Mar;14(1):25-38","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"12094904"}},{"Citation":"Aging Ment Health. 2005 Sep;9(5):414-22","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16024400"}},{"Citation":"Br J Clin Psychol. 2004 Jun;43(Pt 2):177-96","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"15169617"}},{"Citation":"Gerontologist. 2005 Oct;45 Spec No 1(1):11-8","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"16230745"}},{"Citation":"Psychopharmacol Bull. 1988;24(4):653-9","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"3249767"}},{"Citation":"Geriatr Nurs. 2001 Mar-Apr;22(2):106-10","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":"11326220"}},{"Citation":"Int J Nurs Stud. 2003 Jul;40(5):473-9;

The present study aimed to explore how differing degrees of awareness are manifested in the conversations and interactions of people with dementia living in residential care settings, and to identify theoretical and practical implications. Transcripts of 304 conversations with 80 individuals with dementia living in residential care homes in England and Wales were analysed using a grounded theory approach. All 80 participants demonstrated a degree of retained awareness, and there was considerable evidence of retained awareness throughout the conversations, expressed in relation to the three domains of self, relationship, and the environmental context. Two-thirds of participants also demonstrated at least one instance of unawareness, although demonstrations of retained awareness outweighed indications of unawareness. Unawareness was evident in relation to appraisal of functioning and the meaning ascribed to the situation. A grounded theory model of awareness in people with moderate to severe dementia who still communicate verbally proposes that demonstration of awareness involves a set of analytic and behavioural processes, a scope or timescale, and a focus. Awareness is demonstrated in relation to a given focus and scope through the involvement of cognitive processes of varying degrees of complexity, ranging from registering through appraising and interpreting to reflection. Unawareness may be demonstrated in relation to some elements of process, focus or scope, while other aspects remain unaffected. Understanding more about the capacity for retained awareness and the specific ways in which awareness can be compromised may assist care staff in responding effectively to residents'

normal part of ageing; and seeing dementia from a person-centred perspective. Adopting the last of these allows an engagement with palliative care that has the potential to enrich the end-of-life experience of people with dementia, of their families and of the professional care staff who work with them. In this article, it will be argued that our perceptions of what is possible for practising person-centred care at the end of life are constrained by the paradigms we work within. There is developing evidence about how approaches to end-of-life care for people with dementia can move beyond what was, at best, therapeutic pessimism and at worst ill-treatment towards something that optimizes the capacities of those with dementia and mobilizes imaginative care practice."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Downs","ForeName":"Murna","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Studies, Bradfor Dementia Group. m.downs@bradford.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Small","ForeName":"Neil","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Froggatt","ForeName":"Katherine","Initials":"K"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Palliat Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9506762","ISSNLinking":"1357-6321"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":["physiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude to Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Benchmarking","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication Barriers"},{"DescriptorName":"Decision Making"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["etiology","prevention & control","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Competency"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Biological"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Models, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient-Centered Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Philosophy, Medical"},{"DescriptorName":"Philosophy, Nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Terminal Care","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Third-Party Consent"},{"DescriptorName":"Total Quality Management","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Verbal Behavior"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"49"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"29","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"13","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16835560","10.12968\/ijpn.2006.12.5.21173"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"16565124","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2006","Month":"04","Day":"07"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1756-1833","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"332","Issue":"7543","PubDate":{"Year":"2006","Month":"Mar","Day":"25"}},"Title":"BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ"},"ArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of educational interventions in improving detection and management of dementia in primary care: cluster randomised controlled study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"692-6"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To test the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving detection rates and management of dementia in primary care.","Unblinded, cluster randomised, before and after controlled study.","General practices in the United Kingdom (central Scotland and London) between 1999 and 2002.","Three educational interventions: an electronic tutorial carried on a CD Rom; decision support software built into the electronic medical record; and practice based workshops.","36 practices participated in the study.

Knowledge of local diagnostic and support services is less good, and one third of general practitioners expressed limited confidence in their diagnostic skills, whilst two-thirds lacked confidence in management of behaviour and other problems in dementia. The main difficulties identified by general practitioners were talking with patients about the diagnosis, responding to behaviour problems and coordinating support services. General practitioners perceived lack of time and lack of social services support as the major obstacles to good quality care more often than they identified their own unfamiliarity with current management or with local resources. Attitudes to the disclosure of the diagnosis, and to the potential for improving the quality of life of patients and carers varied, but a third of general practitioners believed that dementia care is within a specialist's domain, not that of general practice. More experienced and male general practitioners were more pessimistic about dementia care, as were general practitioners with lower knowledge about dementia. Those reporting greater difficulty with dementia diagnosis and management and those with lower knowledge scores were also less likely to express attitudes endorsing open communication with patient and carer.","Educational support for general practitioners should concentrate on epidemiological knowledge, disclosure of the diagnosis and management of behaviour problems in dementia.

Disciplines represented by this sample were predominantly district nurses, health visitors, practice nurses and community staff nurses. Each practitioner was administered an extensive self-completion questionnaire before the educational interventions were introduced to measure baseline knowledge, confidence and perceived difficulties in dementia care management and attitudes. Results from the quiz indicate lower levels of knowledge about epidemiology and diagnosis, but slightly higher levels about management strategies. Self-reported ratings of confidence were also low and were directly related to ratings of difficulty in identifying dementia and dealing with coexisting behavioural and mental health problems.
