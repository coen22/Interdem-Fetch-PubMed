The English Dementia Strategy aims to improve the quality of service provision for people with dementia. This includes specific mention of improving the quality of life in care homes and as such includes objectives related to developing the workforce knowledge and skills. The Ladder to the Moon Culture Change Studio Engagement Programme (CCSEP) is a staff training approach based on the Positive Psychology framework that uses theatre- and film-based activities.","This study used a wait-list controlled design. However, the data analysis plan was amended to reflect difficulties in data collection, and a quasi-experimental case study approach was consequently utilised. Outcome measures for staff attitudes and beliefs were as follows: Sense of Competence in Dementia Care Staff; Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire; Job Satisfaction Index; Brief Learning Transfer System Inventory; and Scale of Positive and Negative Experience. The Quality of Interaction Schedule (QUIS) was used to observe changes in staff-resident interaction.","Fifty staff in two care homes completed the questionnaires and forty-one undertook formal CCSEP training. In Home A (nursing home), there was no significant change in any of the measures. In Home B (residential home), the QUIS showed an increase in positive interactions post intervention; a significant increase in the Building Relationship subscale of Sense of Competence; and a significant increase in staff sense of hopefulness towards people with dementia. The Brief Learning Transfer System Inventory showed a significant decrease post-intervention. The intervention did not significantly affect the happiness or job satisfaction of care home staff.","The results of this study provide tentative evidence about the efficacy of this staff training programme. Some significant improvement in staff attitudes to people with dementia, staff sense of competence and positive staff-resident interactions were found in one of two homes. It is likely that the organisational problems affecting the other care home limited the implementation and therefore efficacy of the intervention there. The results therefore suggest that when a supportive management structure is in place, CCSEP may be more effective in improving staff attitudes, sense of competence and interactions with residents."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guzm\u00e1n","ForeName":"Azucena","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinical Psychology Department, School of Health in Social Science, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wenborn","ForeName":"Jennifer","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Dementia Research Centre, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Swinson","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Research Centre, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."},{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, Nottingham University, Nothingham, UK."}]}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"09"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Older People Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"101267281","ISSNLinking":"1748-3735"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"Drama"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Nursing","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Inservice Training"},{"DescriptorName":"Motion Pictures"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Organizational Culture"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["care homes","dementia","film activities","positive psychology","staff training"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"22"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"17"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"6","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"11","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28185441","10.1111\/opn.12147"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27817760","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02","Day":"26"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"29","Issue":"2","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"A process evaluation of a Psychomotor Dance Therapy Intervention (DANCIN) for behavior change in dementia: attitudes and beliefs of participating residents and staff.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"313-322"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S104161021600171X","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["In a previous paper, we presented results from a 12-week study of a Psychomotor DANCe Therapy INtervention (DANCIN) based on Danz\u00f3n Latin Ballroom that involves motor, emotional-affective, and cognitive domains, using a multiple-baseline single-case design in three care homes. This paper reports the results of a complementary process evaluation to elicit the attitudes and beliefs of home care staff, participating residents, and family members with the aim of refining the content of DANCIN in dementia care.","An external researcher collected bespoke questionnaires from ten participating residents, 32 care home staff, and three participants' family members who provided impromptu feedback in one of the care homes. The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) provided a methodological tool for identifying active components of the DANCIN approach warranting further exploration, development, and implementation.","Ten residents found DANCIN beneficial in terms of mood and socialization in the care home. Overall, 78% of the staff thought DANCIN led to improvements in residents' mood; 75% agreed that there were improvements in behavior; 56% reported increased job satisfaction; 78% of staff were enthusiastic about receiving further training. Based on participants' responses, four BCTTv1 labels-Social support (emotional), Focus on past success and verbal persuasion to boost self-efficacy, Restructuring the social environment and Habit formation-were identified to describe the intervention. Residents and staff recommended including additional musical genres and extending the session length. Discussions of implementing a supervision system to sustain DANCIN regularly regardless of management or staff turnover were suggested.","Care home residents with mild to moderate dementia wanted to continue DANCIN as part of their routine care and staff and family members were largely supportive of this approach. This study argues in favor of further dissemination of DANCIN in care homes. We provide recommendations for the future development of DANCIN based on the views of key stakeholder groups."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guzm\u00e1n","ForeName":"Azucena","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Clinical Psychology Department,School of Health in Social Science,The University of Edinburgh,Old Medical Quad,Edinburgh,Scotland,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Robinson","ForeName":"Lisa","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Falls and Syncope Service,Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,Newcastle upon Tyne,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rochester","ForeName":"Lynn","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Neuroscience,Newcastle University,Institute for Ageing,Clinical Ageing Research Unit,Campus for Ageing & Vitality,Newcastle-upon-Tyne,England,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"James","ForeName":"Ian A","Initials":"IA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Campus for Ageing & Vitality,Centre of the Health of the Elderly,NTW,NHS FT,(Formerly Newcastle General Hospital),Newcastle-upon-Tyne,England,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hughes","ForeName":"Julian C","Initials":"JC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Bristol,The RICE Centre,Royal United Hospital,Combe Park,Bath,England,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Evaluation Study","Journal Article","Multicenter Study"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"07"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dance Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","rehabilitation"]},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Family"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Job Satisfaction"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"standards"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Staff","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Pain Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["behavior change","dancing","dementia","long-term care","process evaluation","psychomotor therapy","psychosocial","public involvement","staff training"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"11","Day":"8","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27817760","S104161021600171X","10.1017\/S104161021600171X"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26015473","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"04","Day":"27"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"04","Day":"27"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"16","Issue":"3","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"Developing relationships between care staff and people with dementia through Music Therapy and Dance Movement Therapy: A preliminary phenomenological study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"282-296"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1471301215588030","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Background There is an increasing focus on providing effective psychosocial interventions to improve quality of life in dementia care. This study aims to explore the attitudes and perceptions of staff who participated regularly in Music Therapy (MT) and Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) groups for residents with dementia in a nursing home. Method In-depth interviews were conducted with seven members of care home staff. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results A representation modelling the impact of MT and DMT in a nursing care home. Three main themes were identified. 1) Discovering residents' skills and feelings; 2) Learning from the therapists to change approaches to care practice with subthemes: time, space and pace, choice, following the residents' lead; 3) Connection between staff and residents. Conclusion The model indicated that both interventions performed in parallel helped staff to discover residents' skills and feelings. Although it is a small sample size, this study strongly suggests that MT and DMT can have a positive influence in helping care staff to provide a meaningful care environment."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Melhuish","ForeName":"Ruth","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Beuzeboc","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy, London, UK; British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (mBACP), Leicestershire, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guzm\u00e1n","ForeName":"Azucena","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Dementia Research Centre, North East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"07","Day":"26"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Dance Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Music Therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Professional-Patient Relations"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dance Movement Therapy","Music Therapy","dancing","dementia","psychosocial interventions","staff training"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"5","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"4","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"5","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26015473","1471301215588030","10.1177\/1471301215588030"]}}}]}
