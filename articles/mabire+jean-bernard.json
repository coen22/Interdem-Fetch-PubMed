An inventory of the literature is proposed to specify the nature and intentions of use, the modalities of use and technical characteristics. Tablets are used for psychosocial interventions, life support, social living and leisure activities. Autonomously use is possible and group uses promote interpersonal relationships. The equipment must take into account the physical, sensory, cognitive and interests of people with dementia. Use of tablets should promote social inclusion in a non-stigmatizing approach."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mabire","ForeName":"Jean-Bernard","Initials":"JB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Living Lab, Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charras","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Living Lab, Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]},"VernacularTitle":"Tablettes tactiles pour les personnes atteintes de troubles cognitifs li\u00e9s au vieillissement\u00a0: int\u00e9r\u00eats, intentions et modalit\u00e9s d\u2019utilisation."},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"France","MedlineTA":"Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil","NlmUniqueID":"101553404","ISSNLinking":"2115-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Computers, Handheld"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","recommendations","touchscreen tablets","uses"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"2","Day":"1","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31449048","pnv.2019.0814","10.1684\/pnv.2019.0814"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28965500","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"03"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"30","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2018","Month":"06"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Effects of active psychosocial stimulation on social interactions of people with dementia living in a nursing home: a comparative study.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"921-922"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610217002046","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Dementia can interfere with the maintenance of social interactions. The ability to participate in social interactions is one of the elements that enables good social health (Hubert et al., 2011), and having dementia does not automatically eliminates the person's opportunity to have good social health (Vernooij-Dassen and Jeon, 2016). We highlighted in a previous study that people with dementia who did not know each other interacted spontaneously when they were in a stimulating social interaction setting (Mabire et al., 2016). However, a lack of activity and social interaction in nursing homes is still a widespread issue (Harper Ice, 2002). Stimulation of social interactions is rarely used as an intervention and social interactions are seldomly used as social health related outcomes."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mabire","ForeName":"Jean-Bernard","Initials":"JB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation de Rothschild,Paris,75012,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gay","ForeName":"Marie-Claire","Initials":"MC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University Paris Nanterre,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vrignaud","ForeName":"Pierre","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University Paris Nanterre,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Garitte","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University Paris Nanterre,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jeon","ForeName":"Yun-Hee","Initials":"YH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Sydney Nursing School,The University of Syndey,Sydney,Australia."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre,Nijmegen,The NetherlandsandKalorama Foundation,Beek-Ubbergen,The Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Comparative Study","Letter"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"02"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"ErratumIn"},"RefSource":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2018 Jun;30(6):923","PMID":"29970211"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"France"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Status and Dementia Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"4","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["28965500","S1041610217002046","10.1017\/S1041610217002046"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26790570","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"11"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"28","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"06"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Social interactions between people with dementia: pilot evaluation of an observational instrument in a nursing home.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1005-15"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610215002483","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["In dementia, cognitive and psychological disorders might interfere with maintaining social interactions. We have little information about the nature of these interactions of people with dementia in nursing homes. The aim of this study is to investigate social interactions between people with dementia and to validate an observation grid of them.","Fifty-six institutionalized people with dementia took part in this study. Residents had not met beforehand and were divided into groups of four to six. Social behaviors were videotaped and analyzed by two independent raters with an observation grid measuring frequency of occurrence. The ethogram was the conceptual tool that became the Social Observation Behaviors Residents Index (SOBRI).","Two-thousand-six-hundred-seventy instances of behavior were collected. Behaviors directed at others represented 50.90% and self-centered behaviors 47.83%. No negative behaviors were observed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to validate the SOBRI and showed two components of social behaviors that explained about 30.56% of the total variance: social interactions with other residents (18.36%) and with care staff (12.20%). The grid showed a good internal consistency with a Cronbach's \u03b1 of 0.90 for the first component and 0.85 for the second one.","The SOBRI presents robust psychometric validity. This pilot study indicates that people with dementia spontaneously interact with other residents. These results contradict the stigma of non-communication and the stereotypes about dementia. More studies and validations are needed to contribute to the knowledge of social interactions in dementia."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mabire","ForeName":"Jean-Bernard","Initials":"JB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris Ouest,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gay","ForeName":"Marie-Claire","Initials":"MC","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris Ouest,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vrignaud","ForeName":"Pierre","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris Ouest,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Garitte","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Universit\u00e9 Paris Ouest,EA 4430,Nanterre,France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vernooij-Dassen","ForeName":"Myrra","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre,Nijmegen,the Netherlands."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Observational Study","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"01","Day":"21"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"France"},{"DescriptorName":"Homes for the Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics","QualifierName":["instrumentation","methods"]},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires","QualifierName":"standards"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","nursing homes","social interactions"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"1","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26790570","S1041610215002483","10.1017\/S1041610215002483"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","IndexingMethod":"Automated","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23508323","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"04","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2115-7863","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"11","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Mar"}},"Title":"Geriatrie et psychologie neuropsychiatrie du vieillissement","ISOAbbreviation":"Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil"},"ArticleTitle":"[Quality of life in dementia: definitions, difficulties and interest of evaluation].","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"73-81"},"ELocationID":"10.1684\/pnv.2013.0387","Abstract":{"AbstractText":"The concept of quality of life appears to be easy to understand but, actually, is very complex when it comes to define it.

However, quality of life is dependant on several factors that, according to their presence or their absence, can change its perceptions and evaluation. Besides the difficulties of definition, methodological difficulties are added for its evaluation: how to measure a multi-factor concept whose definition is complex and non-consensual?
