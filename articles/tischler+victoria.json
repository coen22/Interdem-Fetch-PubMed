Co-creativity promotes a relational approach to creativity which nurtures inclusion and participation. This paper investigates how co-creativity can affect well-being from the perspectives of people with dementia and their carers; and explores how well-being and agency might be usefully reconsidered. The article draws on findings from a small-scale study 'With All' that focused on music and dance as non-verbal and therefore inclusive artforms. A range of disciplinary perspectives, from psychology, philosophy and social sciences, inform the study. The research used an intrinsic case-study methodology and within this a mixed-methods approach was adopted. This included dialogic interviews, video data analysis and the Canterbury Well-being Scale (CWS). Thematic analysis of the interviews and video data revealed three key themes: autonomy, connections, and art as an enabler. These themes captured the experiences of the participants and facilitated a more nuanced understanding of wellbeing and agency in the context of living with dementia. The analysis of the CWS indicated some improvements in well-being. Following this analysis using multiple data sources, the paper argues that well-being and agency are best understood as relational, and ongoing, rather than completed states. Further both wellbeing and agency contain their opposites (ill-being and passivity). This innovative exploration highlighted the importance of co-creative collaboration as a method that was considered valuable by participants, and that therefore should be further considered in future research with people living with dementia.","CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

relating to the description, explanation, communication, and simplification of arts interventions. Research addressing these challenges must be multidisciplinary, taking account of humanities and science perspectives. Consequently, this research aimed to produce a taxonomy, or classification, of arts interventions for people with dementia as a contribution to this growing field.","This research was underpinned by taxonomy and realist methodology. Taxonomy, the science of classification, produces a common language to name, define, and describe the world around us. Realist theory explains how interventions \"work\" and produce their effects. The main findings in this paper were generated from a case study and a Delphi study.","An arts and dementia taxonomy of 12 dimensions was developed: Art Form, Artistic elements, Artistic focus, Artistic materials, Arts activity, Arts approaches, Arts facilitators, Arts location, Competencies, Complementary arts, Intervention context, Principles.","Arts interventions can be classified according to their contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes. A range of stakeholders could benefit from the taxonomy, including people with dementia, artists, practitioners, carers, care staff, funders, commissioners, researchers, and academics. Language relating to the arts and dementia can be adapted depending on the audience. This is a foundational model requiring further development within the arts and dementia community."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.

Does it have wider social and community benefits?","This mixed-methods study recruits participants from residential care homes, National Health Service (NHS) wards and communities in England and Wales. A visual art intervention is developed and delivered as 1\u00d72-hour weekly group session for 3\u2005months in care and community settings to N=100 people living with dementia. Quantitative and qualitative data are collected at 3 time points to examine the impact on their quality of life, and the perceptions of those who care for them (N=100 family and professional carers). Repeated-measures systematic observations of well-being are obtained during the intervention (intervention vs control condition). The health economics component conducts a social return on investment evaluation of the intervention. Qualitative data are collected at 3 time points (n=35 carers\/staff and n=35 people living with dementia) to explore changes in social connectedness. Self-reported outcomes of the intervention delivery are obtained (n=100). Focus groups with intervention participants (n=40) explore perceptions of impact.

dementia established by Notts County Football in the Community (NCFC). There were three aims: to investigate the effect of early onset dementia on individuals with the condition and their carers; to examine the perceptions of current levels of service provision for people with early onset dementia; and to analyse the impact of the group. Men with dementia (n\u2009=\u20095) attending the sessions, their carers (n\u2009=\u20095), NCFC coaching staff (n\u2009=\u20095) and people organizing\/facilitating the sessions (n\u2009=\u20095) were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews explored the participants' experiences of dementia, their opinions on current service provisions and on the sessions. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were found: loss related to the condition of dementia and its impact on relationships ('Loss'); lack of age-appropriate services for people with early onset dementia ('Lack of Resources'); enjoyment and positive anticipation related to the group for all involved ('Enjoyment and Anticipation'); and 'the Notts County Effect' which attributed the success of the sessions to the strong brand of the football club, and to personalized service in a \"dementia-free\" environment. The NCFC sessions provided a safe low-cost intervention with positive effects upon quality of life for both people with early onset dementia, their carers and the staff involved. This suggests that the service may be valuable to a wider range of people living in different areas.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Carone","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Medicine, Nottingham, Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tischler","ForeName":"Victoria","Initials":"V","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of the Arts London - London College of Fashion, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre for Dementia, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK tom.dening@nottingham.ac.uk."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"26"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Community Mental Health Services"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Soccer"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["dementia","early onset dementia","football","men","quality of life","sporting activities"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"10","Day":"30","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"2","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"11","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25427788","1471301214560239","10.1177\/1471301214560239"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"25425445","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"02","Day":"03"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-2684","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"15","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"Nov"}},"Title":"Dementia (London, England)","ISOAbbreviation":"Dementia (London)"},"ArticleTitle":"'Singing for the Brain': A qualitative study exploring the health and well-being benefits of singing for people with dementia and their carers.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1326-1339"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Dementia has detrimental effects on cognitive, psychological and behavioural functioning, as well as significant impact on those who provide care.
