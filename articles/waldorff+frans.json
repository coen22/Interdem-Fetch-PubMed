outcomes, e.g. morbidity, permanent nursing home (NH) placement, and mortality. However, the predictive value of SRH to NH placement and mortality among elderly people is not consistent. This may be due to cognitive impairment. Since the SRH item is widely used, it is important to know whether SRH has different predictive value among people with cognitive impairments. We aimed to examine SRH and the risk of permanent NH placement and mortality among people with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).","Data are from The Danish Alzheimer Intervention StudY (DAISY), a large randomized controlled trial of psychosocial intervention for patients with mild dementia and their caregivers with 3-years' follow-up. Five out of 14 Danish counties participated and 321 home-living elderly (mean age: 76.2 years) with mild AD (46.4 % male) were included during 2004 and 2005. Self-rated SRH, cognitive function (MMSE), quality of life (proxy-rated QOL-AD), activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL), insight, and socio-demographics were assessed at baseline. Comorbidities and information about NH placement and mortality was obtained over 3-years' follow-up from registries. With Cox proportional hazard regression we analysed the association between SRH (dichotomised into good vs. poor) and NH placement and mortality adjusted for potential confounders.","At baseline 66 % reported excellent or good, and 34 % fair, poor or very poor SRH. Mean MMSE was 24.0 (range: 20-30). NH placement and mortality totalled 28.1 % and 16.5 % at 3-years' follow-up, respectively. Poor SRH at baseline was not related to increased risk of NH placement or to increased mortality neither in the univariable nor in multivariable analysis: In the fully adjusted models HR was 0.63 (95 % CI 0.38-1.05) and 1.28 (95 % CI 0.67-2.45), respectively.","When poor SRH was present we found no increased risk for NH placement or death among elderly people with mild AD.

An analysis adjusted for a range of potential confounders demonstrated a reduced mortality for patients with moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 units\/day): HR 0.23 (95% CI (0.08 to 0.69)) compared with patients who had 1 or <1 unit\/day. Mortality was not significantly different in abstinent patients or in patients with an alcohol consumption of more than 3 units\/day, compared with patients drinking 1 or <1 unit\/day.","In this cohort of patients with mild AD, moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 units\/day) was associated with a significantly lower mortality over a period of 36 months. Further studies are needed in this area.

We included all living Danish citizens 50 years or older who were free of dementia from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2013 (followed up through December 31, 2013). Dementia was ascertained by physician diagnosis from the Danish National Patient Register or the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and\/or by prescription of a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine hydrochloride from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Depression was ascertained by psychiatrist diagnosis from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or by prescription of an antidepressant from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Diabetes mellitus was identified using the National Diabetes Register.","We estimated the risk for all-cause dementia associated with DM, depression, or both using Cox proportional hazards regression models that adjusted for potential confounding factors (eg, demographics) and potential intermediates (eg, medical comorbidities).","During 13\u202f834\u202f645 person-years of follow-up, 59\u202f663 participants (2.4%) developed dementia; of these, 6466 (10.8%) had DM, 15\u202f729 (26.4%) had depression, and 4022 (6.7%) had both. The adjusted hazard ratio for developing all-cause dementia was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.80-1.87) for persons with depression, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.17-1.23) for persons with DM, and 2.17 (95% CI, 2.10-2.24) for those with both compared with persons who had neither exposure. The excess risk for all-cause dementia observed for individuals with comorbid depression and DM surpassed the summed risk associated with each exposure individually, especially for persons younger than 65 years (hazard ratio, 4.84 [95% CI, 4.21-5.55]). The corresponding attributable proportion due to the interaction of comorbid depression and DM was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.13-0.36; P\u2009<\u2009.001) for those younger than 65 years and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.02-0.10; P\u2009=\u2009.001) for those 65 years or older.","Depression and DM were independently associated with a greater risk for dementia, and the combined association of both exposures with the

follow-up time and mostly in small patient groups (including patients with moderate dementia). We investigated awareness in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) over 36 months and studied if a decline in awareness was associated with decline in cognition and increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms.","Awareness was measured on a categorical scale in 95 AD patients (age \u226550 years, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score \u226520). Awareness was rated at three time points (follow-up at 12 and 36 months) where MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q), and Cornell scale for Depression in Dementia also were applied.","At 12 months, 26% had lower awareness rating as compared to baseline and at 36 months lower awareness ratings were found in 39%. At both visits, 16% had higher awareness rating as compared to baseline. Patients with lower awareness at 36 months as compared to baseline had a more rapid increase in NPI-Q score (p = 0.002) over 36 months as compared to patients with stable or improved awareness over 36 months. A more rapid decline in MMSE score was observed for patients with lower awareness at 36 months (as compared to baseline) but only when compared to patients in whom awareness improved over time.","The results show essentially no clear relationship between cognitive decline over three years and awareness. In some cases, awareness remained stable or even improved despite significant cognitive decline. In the subgroup where awareness declined over time, overall ratings of neuropsychiatric symptoms declined more rapidly than in the remaining patients."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vogel","ForeName":"Asmus","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Center,Department of Neurology,Rigshospitalet,University of Copenhagen,Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldorff","ForeName":"Frans Boch","Initials":"FB","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"The Research Unit and Department of General Practice,University of Copenhagen,Denmark."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Waldemar","ForeName":"Gunhild","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Danish Dementia Research Center,Department of Neurology,Rigshospitalet,University of Copenhagen,Denmark."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Multicenter Study","Randomized Controlled Trial"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2014","Month":"07","Day":"30"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":["diagnosis","prevention & control","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Awareness"},{"DescriptorName":"Behavioral Symptoms","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition"},{"DescriptorName":"Denmark"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Disease Progression"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Intelligence Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Neuropsychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Severity of Illness Index"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2014","Month":"7","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2014","Month":"7","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2015","Month":"9","Day":"29","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["25075811","S1041610214001562","10.1017\/S1041610214001562"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"24435893","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2016","Month":"03","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"2044-6055","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"4","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2014","Month":"Jan","Day":"15"}},"Title":"BMJ open","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ Open"},"ArticleTitle":"Early psychosocial intervention in Alzheimer's disease: cost utility evaluation alongside the Danish Alzheimer's Intervention Study (DAISY).","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e004105"},"ELocationID":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2013-004105","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To assess the cost utility of early psychosocial intervention for patients with Alzheimer's disease and their primary caregivers.","Cost utility evaluation alongside a multicentre, randomised controlled trial with 3 years of follow-up.","Primary care and memory clinics in five Danish districts.","330 community-dwelling patients and their primary caregivers.","Psychosocial counselling and support lasting 8-12 months after diagnosis and follow-up at 3, 6, 12 and 36 months in the intervention group or follow-up only in the control group.","The primary outcome measure was the cost of additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

Sixty-six patients (24.6%) lost more than 4% of their body weight during the study period. A logistic regression showed that an increase of 1 baseline body mass index point significantly increased the odds of weight loss by 9%. Furthermore, the results suggested a trend that for men, living alone was a risk factor for losing weight, whereas for women living with somebody was associated with a higher risk. However, further studies are pertinent within this area.

Researchers have been encouraged to examine ways of assessing SRH in cognitively impaired persons, but the validity and the influence on other factors on SRH among cognitively impaired persons remain unknown. This study reports how patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) report SRH and which factors influence SRH. The study was based on baseline data from 321 home living patients with mild AD who participated in the Danish Alzheimer Intervention Study (DAISY). Analysis using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) models revealed that good\/excellent SRH among patients with mild AD were associated with longer education, lack of other chronic conditions, higher scores of quality of life (QOL), lower scores of mini mental state examination (MMSE), and loss of insight in own cognitive deficits. The present results indicate that SRH reported by patients with mild AD may differ from SRH among cognitively intact persons.
