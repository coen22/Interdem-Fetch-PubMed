Previous research suggested its relevance but questioned its applicability. Therefore, this research aimed to (1) investigate the applicability of PM, and (2) increase its applicability, if necessary. Intervention mapping (IM) was used to achieve these goals: process evaluation through semi-structured interviews with psychologists ( = 11) and clients ( = 2) to identify potential improvements for PM and to set an improvement goal (IM-step 1); three focus groups with stakeholders ( = 20) to specify behaviors necessary to reach the improvement goal (IM-step 2); and selection of behavior change techniques and applications to facilitate attainment of these behaviors (IM-step 3). Results showed that psychologists perceived a high drop-out rate, which was partly due to PM being provided to clients that did not belong to the target group. Although PM was generally considered relevant, psychologists articulated its longer-term effects should be improved. To improve PM's applicability, concrete maintenance strategies were developed aiming to maintain clients' well-being by stimulating positive contact with others. Future research must pilot, implement and evaluate these strategies."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van

stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"298"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12888-019-2291-4","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Psychotropic drugs are often prescribed to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home residents with dementia, despite having limited efficacy and considerable side effects. To reduce the inappropriate prescribing of these psychotropic drugs, various non-pharmacological, psychosocial, person-centered, or multidisciplinary interventions are advocated. However, existing multidisciplinary interventions have shown variable effects, with limited effectiveness often resulting from suboptimal implementation. We hypothesize that an effective intervention needs to fit the local situation of a nursing home and that support should be offered during implementation.","We will embed participatory action research within a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to study the effects of a tailored intervention and implementation plan to reduce inappropriate psychotropic drug prescribing. Nursing homes will be provided with tailored information about the perceived problems of managing neuropsychiatric symptoms and we will offer coaching support throughout. Alongside the participatory action research, we will perform a process evaluation to examine the quality of the study, the intervention, and the implementation. Our aim is to recruit 600 residents from 16 nursing homes throughout the Netherlands, with measurements taken at baseline, 8\u2009months, and 16\u2009months. Nursing homes will be randomly allocated to an intervention or a deferred intervention group. During each intervention stage, we will provide information about inappropriate psychotropic drug prescribing, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and difficulties in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms through collaboration with each nursing home. After this, a tailored intervention and implementation plan will be written and implemented, guided by a coach. The primary outcome will be the reduction of inappropriate prescribing, as measured by the Appropriate Psychotropic drug use In Dementia index. Secondary outcomes will be the frequency of psychotropic drug use and neuropsychiatric symptoms, plus quality of life. A mixed methods design will be used for the process evaluation. Effects will be assessed using multilevel analyses. The project leader of the nursing home and the coach will complete questionnaires and in-depth interviews.","We anticipate that the proposed tailored intervention with coaching will reduce inappropriate psychotropic drug prescribing for nursing home residents with neuropsychiatric symptoms. This study should also provide insights into the barriers to, and facilitators of, implementation.","NTR5872 , registered on July 2,

We assessed severity of agitation with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and defined the construct of agitation as a composite score of the NPI-Q items agitation\/aggression, disinhibition, and irritability\/lability; the dependent variable of severe agitation was considered as being present in residents who scored 'severe' in at least one of these symptoms.

This feasibility study had 2 aims: (1) to investigate possible effects regarding VFH, caregiver self-efficacy and the burden experienced, and the frequency of challenging behavior in persons with dementia, and (2) to perform a process evaluation of barriers and facilitators regarding the use of VFH. The respondents were caregivers of home-dwelling persons with dementia participating in VHF (N = 10), a group of caregivers who declined participating in VFH (N = 18), stakeholders (N = 6), and field experts (N = 55). The assessments performed were Positive and Negative Affect Scales, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Sense of Competence Scale, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires. Results demonstrated that caregivers were satisfied with VFH and that various (sub)scores on questionnaires improved. Caregivers mentioned a reluctance toward being filmed and both caregivers and referrers were unfamiliar with VFH.

This study evaluated the implementation of \"Unforgettable,\" an interactive museum program for people with dementia and their caregivers in the Netherlands, and investigated the impact of the program's implementation on the museums as an organization and on the attitudes toward dementia of the museum staff.","Semi-structured interviews were held with 23 stakeholders to identify facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the Unforgettable program in 12 Dutch museums. Based on the model of Meiland et al. (2004), an overview is made of factors influencing the different levels and phases of the implementation process.

inappropriate psychotropic drug (PD) prescription for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in nursing home patients with severe dementia.","In a cross-sectional study, the appropriateness of prescriptions was explored using the Appropriate Psychotropic drug use In Dementia (APID) index sum score. This index assesses information from medical records on indication, evaluation, dosage, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, duplications, and therapy duration. Various measurements were carried out to identify the possible patient and non-patient factors. Linear multilevel regression analysis was used to identify factors that are associated with APID index sum scores. Analyses were performed for groups of PDs separately, i.e. antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.","The sample consisted of 338 patients with a PD prescription that used 147 antipsychotics, 167 antidepressants, 85 anxiolytics, and 76 hypnotics. It was found that older patients and more severe aggression, agitation, apathy, and depression were associated with more appropriate prescriptions. Additionally, less appropriate prescriptions were found to be associated with more severe anxiety, dementia diagnoses other than Alzheimer dementia, more physician time available per patient, more patients per physician, more years of experience of the physician, and higher nurse's workload.","The association of more pronounced NPS with more appropriate PD prescriptions implies that physicians should pay more attention to the appropriateness of PD prescriptions when NPS are less manifest. Non-patient-related factors are also associated with the appropriateness of PD prescriptions.

recommended."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"van der

Retaining a sense of usefulness was considered both important and possible by having social roles or participating in functional activities. The importance of activities providing a sense of usefulness seemed to decrease over time, while the need for pleasant activities seemed to increase. Experienced loss, coping, adaptation, and available external support are important parts of the context in which the person with YOD tries to engage in daily life as much as possible. Active coping styles and external support appear to play a facilitating role in staying engaged.","It is important for people with YOD to have the opportunity to feel useful; especially in the early stages of the condition.

people with dementia and how we address the issue of dementia within society. As a multi-disciplinary working group, established within the framework of the European Dementia Ethics Network of Alzheimer Europe, we aimed to describe the different ways that people with dementia are perceived and portrayed within society and to consider the moral implications of this. In the current paper, we address perceptions of dementia as reflected in explanatory models of its cause and nature, descriptions of characteristics of people with dementia, the use of language, media portrayals and the views of people living with dementia. Academics and professionals could use this exploration to reflect on their behaviour and their use of language regarding people with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gerritsen","ForeName":"Debby L","Initials":"DL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen; Radboudumc Alzheimer Centre; Joachim en Anna, centre for specialized geriatric care, Nijmegen, the Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Oyebode","ForeName":"Jan","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Dementia Studies, University of Bradford, Bradford, BD7 1DP, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gove","ForeName":"Dianne","Initials":"D","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Alzheimer Europe, Luxembourg."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"10"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Ethics, Medical"},{"DescriptorName":"Europe"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mass Media"},{"DescriptorName":"Perception"},{"DescriptorName":"Stereotyping"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer's disease","beliefs","dementia","ethics","guidelines","language","models","perception","portrayal"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"24","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27288459","1471301216654036","10.1177\/1471301216654036"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27140909","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02","Day":"22"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"02","Day":"23"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1741-203X","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"28","Issue":"9","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"09"}},"Title":"International psychogeriatrics","ISOAbbreviation":"Int Psychogeriatr"},"ArticleTitle":"Nature and dementia: development of a person-centered approach.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1455-70"},"ELocationID":"10.1017\/S1041610216000612","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The aim of this study is to develop and try out an approach for personalized nature activities for people with dementia.","A qualitative descriptive study using focus group interviews with people with dementia was conducted.

No significant effects were found for the control-to-intervention group compared with the group who remained in the control group (0.0 CMAI points, 95% CI -2.3 to 2.4). Significant effects were found on 5 of the 12 Neuropsychiatric Inventory items and on the use of antipsychotics (odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.37- 0.80) and antidepressants (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.94). No effect on use of restraints was observed.","The Grip on Challenging behavior program was able to diminish some forms of challenging behavior and the use of psychoactive drugs."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2014 AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.

These drugs can have many side effects and effectiveness is limited. Psychotropic drug use between nursing home units varies and is not solely related to the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is growing evidence indicating that psychotropic drug use is associated with environmental factors, suggesting that the prescription of psychotropic drugs is not only related to (objective) patient factors. However, other factors related to the patient, elderly care physician, nurse and the physical environment are only partially identified. Using a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative research, this study aims to understand the nature of psychotropic drug use and its underlying factors by identifying: 1) frequency and appropriateness of psychotropic drug use for neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia, 2) factors associated with (appropriateness of) psychotropic drug use.","A cross-sectional mixed methods study. For the quantitative study, patients with dementia (n = 540), nursing staff and elderly care physicians of 36 Dementia Special Care Units of 12 nursing homes throughout the Netherlands will be recruited. Six nursing homes with high average rates and six with low average rates of psychotropic drug use, based on a national survey about frequency of psychotropic drug use on units, will be included. Psychotropic drugs include antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and anti-dementia drugs. Appropriateness will be measured by an instrument based on the Medication Appropriateness Index and current guidelines for treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Factors associated to psychotropic drug use, related to the patient, elderly care physician, nurse and physical environment, will be explored using multilevel regression analyses. For the qualitative study, in depth interviews with staff will be held and analyzed to identify and explore other unknown factors.","This study will provide insight into factors that are associated with the frequency and appropriateness of psychotropic drug use for neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The intervention consists of a structured and repeated multidisciplinary medication review supported by education and continuous evaluation. It is conducted by pharmacists, physicians, and nurses and consists of three components: 1) preparation and education, 2) conduct, and 3) evaluation\/guidance. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with appropriate psychotropic drug use. Secondary outcomes are the overall frequency of psychotropic drug use, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, activities of daily living, psychotropic drug side effects and adverse events (including cognition, comorbidity, and mortality).

professional caregivers are not in agreement. This explorative study addresses the question, \"To what degree do professional caregivers, in their daily working routine, focus on the quality-of-life domains that people with dementia consider essential?\" Study participants were nursing assistants who work in 24-hour nursing home care and professionals who offer daytime activities. Three hundred and seventy-four caregivers working on 29 units and 3 day care facilities of 13 nursing homes and in 12 meeting centers filled out a questionnaire. The caregivers reported to focus at least to some degree on most domains considered important by people with dementia. However, relatively little attention was paid to \"financial situation\" and \"being useful\/giving meaning to life.\" Professionals who offer daytime activities focused more than 24-hour care staff on \"attachment,\" \"enjoyment of activities,\" \"sense of aesthetics,\" and \"being useful\/giving meaning to life.\""},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gerritsen","ForeName":"Debby L","Initials":"DL","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Radboud University Nijmegen, Heyendaal Institute, Nijmegen, The Netherlans. d.gerritsen@hin.ru.nl"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ettema","ForeName":"Teake P","Initials":"TP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Boelens","ForeName":"Ellen","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bos","ForeName":"Joke","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hoogeveen","ForeName":"Frans","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"de Lange","ForeName":"Jacomine","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Meihuizen","ForeName":"Lucinda","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sch\u00f6lzel-Dorenbos","ForeName":"Carla J M","Initials":"CJ"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dr\u00f6es","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen","NlmUniqueID":"101082834","ISSNLinking":"1533-3175"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Affect"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude of Health Personnel"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers"},{"DescriptorName":"Day Care, Medical"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["nursing","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Assistants","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Homes"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2007","Month":"7","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2007","Month":"9","Day":"19","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2007","Month":"7","Day":"4","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["17606526","22\/3\/176","10.1177\/1533317507299771"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"17133655","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2007","Month":"12","Day":"12"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"10"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2007","Month":"Jun"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Evaluating the outcome of interventions on quality of life in dementia: selection of the appropriate scale.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"511-9"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["A literature study was conducted to contribute to an adequate use of quality of life (QoL) instruments for the evaluation of interventions in dementia care by providing an overview of properties of QoL measures that acknowledge domains important to dementia patients.","Domains important to patients, and domains that professional caregivers in different settings focus on, are compared to domains represented in nine QoL instruments.

We found that, although in a general sense the two groups were quite similar in their personal experiences of aging, there were specific differences. The children of parents with dementia had a health-concept in which there was substantial emphasis on mental health. Moreover, they linked the dementia of their parent to their own aging and worried about developing a dementia syndrome themselves. They also held different attitudes with regard to end-of-life decisions. Finally, participants having a parent with dementia gave more extensive answers to simple questions.
