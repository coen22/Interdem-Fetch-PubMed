This study investigated social participation in relation to Everyday Technology use and social deprivation of the living environment, among older people with and without dementia in the United Kingdom. Sixty-four people with dementia and sixty-four people without dementia were interviewed using standardized questionnaires: The Participation in ACTivities and Places OUTside Home Questionnaire and Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire. A mixed methods approach integrated statistical analyses and content analysis of free-text responses, through data visualizations. Small, statistically significant associations were found between social participation and Everyday Technology use outside home, for participants with dementia ( = 0.247;  = 0.049) and without dementia ( = 0.343;  = 0.006). A small, statistically significant association was identified between social participation and social deprivation in the living environment, among only participants with dementia ( = 0.267,  = 0.033). The content analysis and graphical joint display revealed motivators, considerations that require extra attention, and strategies for managing social participation. The results underline how Everyday Technology use can be assistive to social participation but also the need to consider social deprivation of the living environment, especially among people with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gaber","ForeName":"Sophie N","Initials":"SN","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division

and able to participate in community activities but who run the risk of reducing activities and social networks. PRIDE is a self-management intervention designed to promote living well and enhance independence for people with mild dementia. This study aims to examine the feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the PRIDE intervention offered in addition to usual care or with usual care alone.","PRIDE is a parallel, two-arm, multicentre, feasibility, randomised controlled trial (RCT). Eligible participants aged 18 or over who have mild dementia (defined as a score of 0.5 or 1 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale) who can participate in the intervention and provide informed consent will be randomised (1:1) to treatment with the PRIDE intervention delivered in addition to usual care, or usual care only. Participants will be followed-up at 3 and 6 month's post-randomisation. There will be an option for a supporter to join each participant. Each supporter will be provided with questionnaires at baseline and follow-ups at 3 to 6 months. Embedded qualitative research with both participants and supporters will explore their perspectives on the intervention investigating a range of themes including acceptability and barriers and facilitators to delivery and participation. The feasibility of conducting a full RCT associated with participant recruitment and follow-up of both conditions, intervention delivery including the recruitment, training, retention of PRIDE trained facilitators, clinical outcomes, intervention and resource use costs and the acceptability of the intervention and study related procedures will be examined.","This study will assess whether a definitive randomised trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of whether the PRIDE intervention offered in addition to usual care is feasible in comparison to usual care alone, and if so, will provide data to inform the design and conduct of a future trial.","ISRCTN, ISRCTN11288961, registered on 23 October 2019, http:\/\/www.isrctn.com\/ISRCTN12345678 Protocol V2.1 dated 19 June

management of symptoms. The aim of the Promoting Independence in Dementia (PRIDE) study was to develop a postdiagnostic social intervention to help people live as well and as independently as possible. The intervention facilitates engagement in evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical and social activities.","Theories to promote adjustment to a dementia diagnosis, including theories of social learning and self-efficacy, were reviewed alongside self-management and the selective optimization model, to form the basis of the intervention. Analyses of two longitudinal databases of older adults, and qualitative analyses of interviews of older people, people with dementia, and their carers about their experiences of dementia, informed the content and focus of the intervention. Consensus expert review involving stakeholders was conducted to synthesize key components. Participants were sourced from the British NHS, voluntary services, and patient and public involvement groups. A tailored manual-based intervention was developed with the aim for this to be delivered by an intervention provider.","Evidence-based stimulating cognitive, physical, and social activities that have been shown to benefit people were key components of the proposed PRIDE intervention. Thirty-two participants including people with dementia (n=4), carers (n=11), dementia advisers (n=14), and older people (n=3) provided feedback on the drafts of the intervention and manual. Seven topics for activities were included (eg, \"making decisions\" and \"getting your message across\"). The manual outlines delivery of the intervention over three sessions where personalized profiles and plans for up to three activities are developed, implemented, and reviewed.","A manualized intervention was constructed based on robust methodology and found to be acceptable to participants. Consultations with stakeholders played a key role in shaping the manualized PRIDE intervention and its delivery. Unlike most social interventions for dementia, the target audience for our intervention is the people with dementia themselves."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 Yates et

memory, and changes in behavior. These symptoms can affect how the person with dementia understands and performs in social interactions. This qualitative review investigated how people with mild to moderate dementia managed social connections. A systematic search of social science databases retrieved 13 articles; data were synthesized using thematic analysis. Results established the work undertaken by people with dementia to maintain and present a social persona seen as socially acceptable. Interpretations are contextualized within Goffman and Sabat's theories on \"self.\" People with dementia were agentic in impression management: undertaking work to maintain recognized social roles, while being aware of when their illness led to others discrediting them. Wider recognition of strategies used to maintain a social self could inform interventions designed to increase capability and confidence in co-managing social connections following dementia diagnosis."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Birt","ForeName":"Linda","Initials":"L","Identifier":"0000-0002-4527-4414","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Griffiths","ForeName":"Rebecca","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charlesworth","ForeName":"Georgina","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"University College London, London, United Kingdom."},{"Affiliation":"North East London NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Higgs","ForeName":"Paul","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University College London, London, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leung","ForeName":"Phuong","Initials":"P","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University College London, London, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Poland","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"25"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"Qual Health Res","NlmUniqueID":"9202144","ISSNLinking":"1049-7323"},"CitationSubset":"T","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Concept"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Environment"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Canada","Europe","Goffman","North America","Sabat","agency","dementia","literature review","qualitative","self","social construction","sociology","stigma"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"11","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"9","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31550999","10.1177\/1049732319874782"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"31538704","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"13"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"08","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1369-7625","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"22","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2019","Month":"12"}},"Title":"Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy","ISOAbbreviation":"Health Expect"},"ArticleTitle":"Embedding patient and public involvement: Managing tacit and explicit expectations.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1231-1239"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/hex.12952","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Evidencing well-planned and implemented patient and public involvement (PPI) in a research project is increasingly required in funding bids and dissemination activities.

people living with dementia (PLWD). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is one of the few promising treatments; however, it is unclear whether PLWD have the necessary prerequisites to engage in this. Having an understanding of cognitive mediation, that a thought mediates the relationship between an antecedent event and its emotional consequence, is key for engaging with CBT and is also a critical component of emotion regulation. There are no measures of this construct validated for PLWD. This study aims to adapt and validate an existing measure for this population. A secondary aim is to assess its applicability in older adults (OA) without a recognised neurocognitive impairment.","A measure of cognitive mediation was adapted via expert and service user consultation for use in PLWD. A total of 102 PLWD and 77 OA without neurocognitive impairments completed the adapted measure along with two measures of emotion recognition and reasoning. Factor structure was examined separately in both samples, and the measure reduced, with convergent validity assessed.","A final measure of 10 items (named the CM-Dem) was subject to factor analysis yielding a single factor solution. The measure showed good psychometric properties in PLWD, including good model fit, high internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and moderate convergent validity with related constructs. In contrast, poor validity was found in OA, especially a lack of convergent validity.","The CM-Dem has clinical and research utility as a measure of cognitive mediation in PLWD, but less so in OA."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stott","ForeName":"Joshua","Initials":"J","Identifier":"0000-0003-1361-053X","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cadman","ForeName":"Tim","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Population Health Science, Bristol Medical School, Oakfield House, Oakfield Grove, Bristol, BS8 2BN, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Scior","ForeName":"Katrina","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Brede","ForeName":"Janina","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chadwick","ForeName":"Eleanor","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charlesworth","ForeName":"Georgina","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":{"Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Validation Study"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"19"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety Disorders","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depressive Disorder","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Factor Analysis, Statistical"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychometrics"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["anxiety","cognitive behavioural therapy","cognitive mediation","dementia","depression","emotion regulation","measure development"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"14"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"08"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"4","Day":"9","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"7","Day":"20","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31322763","10.1002\/gps.5169"]},"ReferenceList":{"Title":"REFERENCES","Reference":[{"Citation":"Livingston G, Sommerlad A, Orgeta V, et al.

capable to manage the caregiving task and is an important clinical concept in the caregiving literature. The aim of this review was to identify the factors, both positive and negative, associated with a caregiver's perception of their sense of competence.","A systematic review of the literature was conducted, retrieving both quantitative and qualitative papers from databases PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Medline. A quality assessment was conducted using the STROBE and CASP checklists, and the quality rating informed the inclusion of papers ensuring the evidence was robust. Narrative synthesis was employed to synthesize the findings and to generate an updated conceptual model of sense of competence.","Seventeen papers were included in the review, all of which were moderate to high quality. These included 13 quantitative, three mixed-methods and one qualitative study. Factors associated with sense of competence included: behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), caregiver depression, gratitude, and the ability to find meaning in caregiving.","The results of this review demonstrate that both positive and negative aspects of caring are associated with caregiver sense of competence. Positive and negative aspects of caregiving act in tandem to influence caregiver perception of their competence. The proposed model of sense of competence aims to guide future research and clinical interventions aimed at improving this domain but requires further testing, as due to the observational nature of

applications to many grant-awarding bodies. Numerous models of consultation, collaboration and leadership have been developed to support all stages of research, from ideas development through to project execution and dissemination of findings. However, the interface between researchers and lay members is not always a happy one; scientific 'fact' may not square with lived experience; clinical researchers may regard their accumulated knowledge from working with many people with dementia and their families as 'more valid' than the individual experience(s) of a small number of public and patient involvement representatives; public and patient involvement members can fall victim to tokenism and manipulation. In this opinion piece, I consider the nature of representation in public and patient involvement in dementia research, and whether identifying disconfirmatory cases provides greater value than current consensus building approaches.

Both medium to longer-term multi-component exercise of moderate to high intensity, and, group cognitive stimulation consistently show benefits. There is not sufficient evidence to determine whether psychological or social interventions might improve either mood or behaviour due to the heterogeneity of the studies and interventions included in the reviews.","There is good evidence that multi-component exercise with sufficient intensity improves global physical and cognitive functions and activities of daily living skills. There is also good evidence that group-based cognitive stimulation improves cognitive functions, social interaction and quality of life.

The current study addresses this.","In a secondary analysis of baseline data from a recent intervention trial (N\u2009=\u2009284) with cross-validation in baseline data from a second trial (N\u2009=\u2009230), the authors used confirmatory factor analysis to test whether a one-, two-, or three-factor structure best fit the data and used indices of model misspecification to respecify. Internal consistency, concurrent validity of obtained factors, and measurement invariance across gender, age, kinship, and cohabitation status were assessed.","A three-factor structure best fit the data. Removal of one item improved model fit. The factors showed good internal consistency and high levels of concurrent validity. Measurement invariance was adequate across gender and kinship but not age or cohabitation status. Results were replicated in the cross-validation sample, enhancing reliability.","In this group the HADS measured three factors; depression, anxiety, and negative affectivity. The depression scale can be used as originally intended, supporting results of large clinical trials. The HADS does not validly measure distress or anxiety. Consequently, clinical practice recommendations could be revisited, and future research trials should not use HADS anxiety or distress as outcomes. Researchers should pay attention to measurement invariance when using HADS to compare carer subgroups."],"CopyrightInformation":"Copyright \u00a9 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

There is also no consensus on disease modifying outcomes. We aimed to produce the first evidence-based consensus on core outcome measures for trials of disease modification in mild-to-moderate dementia.","We defined disease-modification interventions as those aiming to change the underlying pathology. We systematically searched electronic databases and previous systematic reviews for published and ongoing trials of disease-modifying treatments in mild-to-moderate dementia. We included 149\/22,918 of the references found; with 81 outcome measures from 125 trials. Trials involved participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone (n = 111), or AD and mild cognitive impairment (n = 8) and three vascular dementia. We divided outcomes by the domain measured (cognition, activities of daily living, biological markers, neuropsychiatric symptoms, quality of life, global). We calculated the number of trials and of participants using each outcome. We detailed psychometric properties of each outcome. We sought the views of people living with dementia and family carers in three cities through Alzheimer's society focus groups. Attendees at a consensus conference (experts in dementia research, disease-modification and harmonisation measures) decided on the core set of outcomes using these results. Recommended core outcomes were cognition as the fundamental deficit in dementia and to indicate disease modification, serial structural MRIs. Cognition should be measured by Mini Mental State Examination or Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale. MRIs would be optional for patients. We also made recommendations for measuring important, but non-core domains which may not change despite disease modification.","Most trials were about AD. Specific instruments may be superseded. We searched one database for psychometric properties.","This is the first review to identify the 81 outcome measures the research community uses for disease-modifying trials in mild-to-moderate dementia. Our recommendations will facilitate designing, comparing and meta-analysing disease modification trials in mild-to-moderate dementia, increasing their value.","PROSPERO no.

currently no disease-modifying treatment available to halt or delay the progression of the disease pathology in dementia. An agreed core set of the best-available and most appropriate outcomes for disease modification would facilitate the design of trials and ensure consistency across disease modification trials, as well as making results comparable and meta-analysable in future trials.","To agree a set of core outcomes for disease modification trials for mild to moderate dementia with the UK dementia research community and patient and public involvement (PPI).","We included disease modification trials with quantitative outcomes of efficacy from (1) references from related systematic reviews in workstream 1; (2) searches of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group study register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature and PsycINFO on 11 December 2015, and clinical trial registries [International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) and clinicaltrials.gov] on 22 and 29 January 2016; and (3) hand-searches of reference lists of relevant systematic reviews from database searches.","The project consisted of four workstreams. (1) We obtained related core outcome sets and work from co-applicants. (2) We systematically reviewed published and ongoing disease modification trials to identify the outcomes used in different domains. We extracted outcomes used in each trial, recording how many used each outcome and with how many participants. We divided outcomes into the domains measured and searched for validation data. (3) We consulted with PPI participants about recommended outcomes. (4) We presented all the synthesised information at a conference attended by the wider body of National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) dementia researchers to reach consensus on a core set of outcomes.","We included 149 papers from the 22,918 papers screened, referring to 125 individual trials. Eighty-one outcomes were used across trials, including 72 scales [31 cognitive, 12 activities of daily living (ADLs), 10 global, 16 neuropsychiatric and three quality of life] and nine biological techniques. We consulted with 18 people for PPI. The conference decided that only cognition and biological markers are core measures of disease modification. Cognition should be measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and brain changes through structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of participants. All other domains are important but not core. We recommend using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory for neuropsychiatric symptoms: the Disability Assessment for Dementia for ADLs, the Dementia Quality of Life Measure for quality of life and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale to measure dementia globally.","Most of the trials included participants with Alzheimer's disease, so recommendations may not apply to other types of dementia. We did not conduct economic analyses. The PPI consultation was limited to members of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network.","Cognitive outcomes and biological markers form the core outcome set for future disease modification trials, measured by the MMSE or ADAS-Cog, and structural MRI in a subset of participants.","We envisage that the core set may be superseded in the future, particularly for other types of dementia. There is a need to develop an algorithm to compare scores on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog.","The project was registered with Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials [ www.comet-initiative.org\/studies\/details\/819?result=true (accessed 7 April 2016)].

The difference in screening performance between the ACE-III alone and the ACE-III adjusted for TOPF was assessed against a reference standard; the presence or absence of a diagnosis of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or others).","Logistic regression and receiver operating curve analyses indicated that the ACE-III has excellent screening accuracy (93% sensitivity, 94% specificity) in distinguishing those with and without a dementia diagnosis. Although ACE-III scores were associated with TOPF scores, TOPF scores may be affected by having dementia and screening accuracy was not improved by accounting for premorbid IQ, age, or years of education.","ACE-III screening accuracy is high and screening performance is robust to variation in premorbid IQ, age, and years of education.

Yet dementia remains one of the most feared conditions. The sociological lens of citizenship provides a conceptual framework for reviewing the role of society and culture in repositioning dementia away from deficit to a discourse of agency and interdependence. Awareness of cognitive change, and engaging with the diagnostic process, moves people into a transitional, or 'liminal' state of uncertainty. They are no longer able to return to their previous status, but may resist the unwanted status of 'person with dementia'. Drawing on qualitative studies on social participation by people with dementia, we suggest that whether people are able to move beyond the liminal phase depends on acceptance of the diagnosis, social capital, personal and cultural beliefs, the responses of others and comorbidities. Some people publicly embrace a new identity whereas others withdraw, or are withdrawn, from society to live in the shadow of the fourth age. We suggest narratives of deficit fail to reflect the agency people with dementia can enact to shape their social worlds in ways which enable them to establish post-liminal citizen roles.

well-validated, self-report measure of both anxiety and depression. It is frequently used with people with dementia. However, its structural validity has never been examined in this population. The current study used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to assess this.","Baseline data from two intervention studies for people with mild to moderate dementia were combined (N\u2009=\u2009268). CFA was used to test whether a one, two or three factor structure best fit the data. Indices of model misspecification were examined to test for poor quality items, and models re-specified accordingly. Finally, measurement invariance across gender and different levels of cognitive impairment was assessed.","A one-factor structure did not fit the data. Two and three factor structures fitted the data equally well. Model fit was improved by removal of two items. Measurement invariance was adequate across gender, but poor across groups with differing levels of cognitive impairment.","The HADS is acceptable and feasible but difficult to interpret in a dementia population. We suggest that it should be interpreted as measuring two separate factors of anxiety and depression and not one 'distress' factor. However, two items may need to be removed, affecting cut-off scores. Poor measurement invariance means the HADS may not be a good tool for measuring differences in anxiety and depression between those with mild and those with moderate cognitive impairment.

Paper quality was appraised using the Downs and Black Checklist (1998).","Forty medium and high quality quantitative papers met the inclusion criteria, 16 were suitable to be included in a meta-analysis of mean distress scores. Depressive behaviors were the most distressing for caregivers followed by agitation\/aggression and apathy. Euphoria was the least distressing. Correlation coefficients between mean total behavior scores and mean distress scores were pooled for four studies. Irritability, aberrant motor behavior and delusions were the most strongly correlated to distress, disinhibition was the least correlated.","The evidence is not conclusive as to whether some BPSD impact caregiver well-being more than others. Studies which validly examined BPSD individually were limited, and the included studies used numerous measures of BPSD and numerous measures of caregiver well-being. Future research may benefit from a consistent measure of BPSD, examining BPSD individually, and by examining the causal mechanisms by which BPSD impact well-being by including caregiver variables so that interventions can be designed to target BPSD more effectively."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Feast","ForeName":"Alexandra","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Psychiatry,University College London,London,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Moniz-Cook","ForeName":"Esme","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty of Health and Social Care,University of Hull,Hull,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Stoner","ForeName":"Charlotte","Initials":"C","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology,University College London,London,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charlesworth","ForeName":"Georgina","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology,University College London,London,UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Orrell","ForeName":"Martin","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health,University of Nottingham,Nottingham,UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","GrantList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Grant":[{"GrantID":"MCCC-FPR-11-U","Acronym":"MCCC_","Agency":"Marie Curie","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1083","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"RP-PG-0606-1067","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"},{"GrantID":"RP-PG-060-1083","Acronym":"DH_","Agency":"Department of Health","Country":"United Kingdom"}]},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review","Systematic Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2016","Month":"06","Day":"27"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","CommentsCorrectionsList":{"CommentsCorrections":{"@attributes":{"RefType":"CommentIn"},"RefSource":"Int Psychogeriatr. 2016 Nov;28(11):1759-1760","PMID":"27634618"}},"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Behavioral Symptoms"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost of Illness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":["diagnosis","prevention & control","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Emotional Adjustment"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Mental Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia","carer","dementia","neuropsychiatric symptoms","quality of life"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"1","Day":"31","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2016","Month":"6","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["27345942","S1041610216000922","10.1017\/S1041610216000922"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"26989095","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"09","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2020","Month":"03","Day":"20"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1472-1465","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"208","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"05"}},"Title":"The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science","ISOAbbreviation":"Br J Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia and the challenges for family carers: systematic review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"429-34"},"ELocationID":"10.1192\/bjp.bp.114.153684","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Tailored psychosocial interventions can help families to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD), but carer responses to their relative's behaviours contribute to the success of support programmes.","To understand why some family carers have difficulty in dealing with BPSD, in order to improve the quality of personalised care that is offered.","A systematic review and meta-ethnographic synthesis was conducted of high-quality quantitative and qualitative studies between 1980 and 2012.","We identified 25 high-quality studies and two main reasons for behaviours being reported as challenging by family carers: changes in communication and relationships, resulting in 'feeling bereft';

family carers (FCs) who could provide peer support to newer carers in\u00a0a\u00a0similar care situation. The aims of this paper are to: (i) use a cross-sectional study design to compare characteristics of volunteers and recipients of a peer support programme for FCs of people with dementia, in terms of demographic background, social networks and psychological well-being; and (ii) use a longitudinal study design to explore the overall impact of the programme on the volunteers in terms of psychological well-being. Data were collected from programmes run in Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Berkshire and four London boroughs between October 2009 and March 2013. The volunteer role entailed empathic listening and encouragement over a 10-month period. Both carer support volunteers (N\u00a0=\u00a087) and recipient FCs (N\u00a0=\u00a0109) provided baseline demographic information. Data on social networks, personal growth, self-efficacy, service use and well-being (SF-12; EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, Pleasure-19) were collected prior to the start of the intervention (N\u00a0=\u00a043) and at either 3- to 5\u00a0month or 10\u00a0month follow-up (N\u00a0=\u00a021). Volunteers were more likely than recipients of support to be female and to have cared for a parent\/grandparent rather than spouse. Volunteers were also more psychologically well than support recipients in terms of personal growth, depression and perceived well-being. The longitudinal analysis identified small but significant declines in personal growth and autonomy and a positive correlation between the volunteers' duration of involvement and perceived well-being. These findings suggest that carers who volunteer for emotional support roles are resilient and are at little psychological risk from volunteering.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2016 John Wiley &

predictors of BPSD-related distress and their potential mechanisms.","Informal caregivers of people with dementia (n\u2009=\u2009157) recruited from 28 community mental health teams in six NHS Trusts across England completed questionnaires regarding psychosocial factors (relationship quality, competence, guilt, health-related quality of life in the caregiver and person with dementia, reactivity to behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia [BPSD] and burden) and frequency of BPSD. Analyses of BPSD-related distress include hierarchical multiple regression, mediation, moderation and path analysis.","Caregiver psychosocial factors explained 56% of the variance in BPSD-related distress. After controlling for these factors, frequency of BPSD was not a significant predictor of BPSD-related distress. Caregiver reactivity to BPSD, burden, competence and relationship quality directly influenced BPSD-related distress. Guilt influenced distress indirectly via competence, burden and reactivity to BPSD. The final model accounted for 41% of the variance in BPSD-related distress and achieved a good fit to the data (\u03c7 \u2009=\u200923.920, df\u2009=\u200919, p\u2009=\u20090.199).","Caregiver psychosocial factors including sense of competence, guilt, burden and reactivity to BPSD contribute to BPSD-related distress. Tailored interventions for managing behaviour problems in family settings could focus on these factors associated with BPSD-related distress to minimise distress in families.

The aim of the therapy is to reduce symptoms of anxiety by increasing a sense of safety and self-efficacy. The therapy is characterized by a person-centered approach to CBT, using individual tailoring to accommodate for cognitive deficits and other challenges. Three phases of therapy are described: (a) socialization to model (including overcoming barriers to participation), goal setting, and formulation; (b) application of cognitive and behavioral change techniques to address unhelpful autonomic reactions, \"strategic\" reactions, \"rules for living,\" and interpersonal aspects; and (c) consolidation and ending in the context of chronic, deteriorating illness.

This model was informed by review findings and discussed in the context of existing conceptual models of carer adaptation and empirical research. Review findings offer support for the application of the SE theory to caring and for the two-factor view of carer appraisals and well-being. Findings do not support the independence of the negative and positive pathways. The review was valuable in highlighting methodological challenges confronting this area of research, particularly the conceptualisation and measurement issues surrounding both SE and health-related QoL.","The model might have theoretical implications in guiding future research and advancing theoretical models of caring.

dementia. In recent years reminiscence groups have extended to include family members, but carers' experience of attending joint sessions is undocumented. This qualitative study explored the experience of 18 family carers attending 'Remembering Yesterday Caring Today' groups. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: experiencing carer support; shared experience; expectations (met and unmet), carer perspectives of the person with dementia's experience; and learning and comparing. Family carers' experiences varied, with some experiencing the intervention as entirely positive whereas others had more mixed feelings. Negative aspects included the lack of respite from their relative, the lack of emphasis on their own needs, and experiencing additional stress and guilt through not being able to implement newly acquired skills. These findings may explain the failure of a recent trial of joint reminiscence groups to replicate previous findings of positive benefit. More targeted research within subgroups of carers is required to justify the continued use of joint reminiscence groups in dementia care.

Pilot trials using the same design and methods as the subsequent main trial are ethically and financially advantageous especially when pilot and main trial data can be pooled. For explanatory trials in which internal validity is paramount, there is little room for variation of methods between the pilot and main trial. For pragmatic trials, where generalisability or external validity is key, greater flexibility is written into trial protocols to allow for 'real life' variation in procedures. We describe the development of a checklist for use in decision-making on whether pilot data can be carried forward to the main trial dataset without compromising trial integrity. We illustrate the use of the checklist using a pragmatic trial of psychosocial interventions for family carers of people with dementia as a case study.

Anxiety is often treated with antipsychotic medication, which has limited efficacy and serious side effects. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely used to treat anxiety in a range of populations, yet no RCTs on CBT for anxiety in dementia exist. This study aims to develop a CBT for anxiety in dementia manual and to determine its feasibility in a pilot RCT.","Phase I involves the development of a CBT for anxiety in dementia manual, through a process of (1) focus groups, (2) comprehensive literature reviews, (3) expert consultation, (4) a consensus conference and (5) field testing. Phase II involves the evaluation of the manual with 50 participants with mild to moderate dementia and anxiety (and their carers) in a pilot, two-armed RCT. Participants will receive either ten sessions of CBT or treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures are anxiety and costs. Secondary outcome measures are participant quality of life, behavioural disturbance, cognition, depression, mood and perceived relationship with the carer, and carer mood and perceived relationship with the person with dementia. Measures will be administered at baseline, 15 weeks and 6 months. Approximately 12 qualitative interviews will be used to gather service-users' perspectives on the intervention.","This study aims to determine the feasibility of CBT for people with anxiety and dementia and provide data on the effect size of the intervention in order to conduct a power analysis for a definitive RCT. The manual will be revised according to qualitative and quantitative findings. Its publication will enable its availability throughout the NHS and beyond.","ISRCTN64806852."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Spector","ForeName":"Aimee","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

practicalities and acceptability of interventions for target end users.","The current paper presented two consensus methods, not commonly used in consultation with service users, to develop a peer support intervention for family carers of people with dementia (SHIELD Carer Supporter Programme).","Study 1 was a modified Delphi process combined with a consensus conference to explore details of the intervention from the carer and volunteer perspective. Study 2 was an anonymous reader consultation to develop informed consent documents for the intervention trial. Median scores were used to measure and establish consensus. Open-ended responses were thematically analysed.","Study 1: twenty-five delegates participated (eight were current\/former carers) in the first round Delphi questionnaire, with 21 attending the conference. Five completed the Round 2 questionnaire. Study 2: six family carers and 11 people with dementia took part in the consultation.","Study 1: the role of the peer supporters was developed in terms of relational and practical aspects of the intervention. Study 2: changes were made to the documents, reflecting service user input, but the effectiveness of this less discursive type of service user involvement was unclear.","Study 1 methods allowed for service users to contribute significantly and meaningfully, but maybe limiting some design innovation.

people with dementia or their carers. The BEfriending and Costs of CAring trial (BECCA, ISRCTN08130075) aimed to establish whether a structured befriending service improved the quality of life of carers of people with dementia, and at what cost.","We performed an economic evaluation alongside a single blind, randomised controlled trial in a community setting of 236 carers of people with a primary progressive dementia. The intervention was contact with a Befriender Facilitator (BF), and offer of match with a trained lay volunteer befriender compared with no BF contact. Main outcome measures were health and social care, voluntary sector, and family care costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in carers over 15 months.","Mean QALYs per carer over 15 months were 0.017 higher in the intervention group compared with control (95%CI: -0.051, 0.083). Mean costs from a societal perspective were pound 1,813 higher (- pound 11,312, pound 14,984). The point estimate Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is thus pound 105,954 per incremental QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests a 42.2% probability that the ICER is below pound 30,000 per QALY. Inclusion of dementia patient QALYs reduces the ICER to pound 28,848 (51.4% probability below pound 30,000).","Befriending leads to a non-significant trend towards improved carer quality of life, and there is a non-significant trend towards higher costs for all sectors. It is unlikely that befriending is a cost-effective intervention from the point of view of society."],"CopyrightInformation":"(c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Wilson","ForeName":"Edward","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Health Economics Group, School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia, UK. ed.wilson@uea.ac.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thalanany","ForeName":"Mariamma","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Shepstone","ForeName":"Lee","Initials":"L"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charlesworth","ForeName":"Georgina","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Poland","ForeName":"Fiona","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Harvey","ForeName":"Ian","Initials":"I"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Price","ForeName":"David","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Reynolds","ForeName":"Shirley","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mugford","ForeName":"Miranda","Initials":"M"}]},"Language":"eng","DataBankList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"DataBank":{"DataBankName":"ISRCTN","AccessionNumberList":{"AccessionNumber":"ISRCTN08130075"}}},"PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Randomized Controlled Trial","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":["economics","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Costs and Cost Analysis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["economics","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Services for the Aged","QualifierName":["economics","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Home Care Services","QualifierName":["economics","statistics & numerical data"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Outcome Assessment, Health Care","QualifierName":"economics"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality-Adjusted Life Years"},{"DescriptorName":"Single-Blind Method"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"United Kingdom"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"23","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"12","Day":"23","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2010","Month":"7","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["19101921","10.1002\/gps.2164"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"18505757","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2008","Month":"07","Day":"15"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1756-1833","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"336","Issue":"7656","PubDate":{"Year":"2008","Month":"Jun","Day":"07"}},"Title":"BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","ISOAbbreviation":"BMJ"},"ArticleTitle":"Befriending carers of people with dementia: randomised controlled trial.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"1295-7"},"ELocationID":"10.1136\/bmj.39549.548831.AE","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To evaluate the effectiveness of a voluntary sector based befriending scheme in improving psychological wellbeing and quality of life for family carers of people with dementia.","Single blind randomised controlled trial.","Community settings in East Anglia and London.","236 family carers of people with primary progressive dementia.","Contact with a befriender facilitator and offer of match with a trained lay volunteer befriender compared with no befriender facilitator contact; all participants continued to receive \"usual care.\"","Carers' mood (hospital anxiety and depression scale-depression) and health related quality of life (EuroQoL) at 15 months post-randomisation.","The intention to treat analysis showed no benefit for the intervention \"access to a befriender facilitator\" on the primary outcome measure or on any of the secondary outcome measures.","In common with many carers' services, befriending schemes are not taken up by all carers, and providing access to a befriending scheme is not effective in improving wellbeing.
