They can be either an enabler or an obstacle leading to social exclusion. The Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer gathered international experts of dementia care, with backgrounds in biomedical, human and social sciences, to analyze how assistive technologies can address the capabilities of people with dementia, on the basis of their needs. Discussion covered the unmet needs of people with dementia, the domains of daily life activities where assistive technologies can provide help to people with dementia, the enabling and empowering impact of technology to improve their safety and wellbeing, barriers and limits of use, technology assessment, ethical and legal issues. The capability approach (possible freedom) appears particularly relevant in person-centered dementia care and technology development. The focus is not on the solution, rather on what the person can do with it: seeing dementia as disability, with technology as an enabler to promote capabilities of the person, provides a useful framework for both research and practice. This article summarizes how these concepts took momentum in professional practice and public policies in the past 15 years (2000-2015), discusses current issues in the design, development and economic model of assistive technologies for people with dementia, and covers how these technologies are being used and assessed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kenigsberg","ForeName":"Paul-Ariel","Initials":"PA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aquino","ForeName":"Jean-Pierre","Initials":"JP","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"B\u00e9rard","ForeName":"Alain","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Br\u00e9mond","ForeName":"Fran\u00e7ois","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CoBTeK Lab & INRIA STARS, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te-d'Azur, Nice, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charras","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dro\u00ebs","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gzil","ForeName":"Fabrice","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hicks","ForeName":"Ben","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bournemouth University Dementia Institute, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Salford Institute for Dementia University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nguyen","ForeName":"Sao-Mai","Initials":"SM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Lab-STICC, Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pino","ForeName":"Maribel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Laboratoire Lusage, H\u00f4pital Broca, Assistance publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sacco","ForeName":"Guillaume","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche, CHU de Nice;

To study these failures we analysed the meta-analyses of the Cochrane Library. Among 18 meta-analyses, 11 were selected for the purpose of this study. These papers were analysed on the basis of the Cochrane selection criteria, methodological quality and biases, principal outcomes and implication for practice and research. Results are discussed and analysed according to the clinical practice and scientific literature of the matter of concern. Main outcomes of this review point that: (1) it is necessary to adopt an investigation methodology adapted to specific characteristics of psychosocial interventions; (2) methodological weaknesses of randomised control trials are prejudicial to quality of research and clinical practice; (3) implementation of randomised control trials call for necessary fundamental prerequisites; and (4) other research methods than randomised control trials are susceptible to give as much, if not more, informative results. A research and practice implementation strategy is suggested.

To understand them better, the Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer has brought together a multi-disciplinary expert group. Aristote's five senses must be enhanced by today's knowledge of proprioception, motor cognition and pain perception. When cognition breaks down, the person with dementia perceives the world around her with her sensory experience, yet is unable to integrate all this information to understand the context. The treatment of multiple sensory inputs by the brain is closely linked to cognitive processes. Sensory deficits reduce considerably the autonomy of people with dementia in their daily life and their relations with others, increase their social isolation and the risk of accidents. Professionals involved with neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly aware of sensory deficits, which can bias the results of cognitive tests. However, there are simple tools to detect these deficits, notably for vision, hearing and balance disorders, which can be corrected. Many interventions for cognitive rehabilitation or quality of life improvement are based on sensory functions. The environment of people with dementia must be adapted to become understandable, comfortable, safe and eventually therapeutic.

conducted using the principal scientific search engines. A work group of experts in music therapy and psychosocial techniques then considered the different points highlighted in the review of literature and discussed them.","Clinical and neurophysiological studies have enlightened some positive benefits of music in providing support for people with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders. Music therapy acts mainly through emotional and psycho-physiological pathways. It includes a series of techniques that can respond to targeted therapeutic objectives. Some studies have shown that music therapy reduces anxiety, alleviates periods of depression and aggressive behaviour and thus significantly improves mood, communication and autonomy of patients.","Psychosocial interventions, such as music therapy, can contribute to maintain or rehabilitate functional cognitive and sensory abilities, as well as emotional and social skills and to reduce the severity of some behavioural disorders."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guetin","ForeName":"St\u00e9phane","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"1AMARC-Association de Musicoth\u00e9rapie Applications et Recherches Cliniques, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charras","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Berard","ForeName":"Alain","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Arbus","ForeName":"Christophe","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Berthelon","ForeName":"Patrick","Initials":"P"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Blanc","ForeName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Blayac","ForeName":"Jean-Pierre","Initials":"JP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bonte","ForeName":"Florence","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bouceffa","ForeName":"Jean-Paul","Initials":"JP"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clement","ForeName":"Sylvain","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ducourneau","ForeName":"G\u00e9rard","Initials":"G"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gzil","ForeName":"Fabrice","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Laeng","ForeName":"Nathalie","Initials":"N"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Lecourt","ForeName":"Edith","Initials":"E"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ledoux","ForeName":"Sylvie","Initials":"S"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Platel","ForeName":"Herv\u00e9","Initials":"H"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thomas-Anterion","ForeName":"Catherine","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Touchon","ForeName":"Jacques","Initials":"J"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Vrait","ForeName":"Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier","Initials":"FX"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Leger","ForeName":"Jean-Marie","Initials":"JM"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Case Reports","Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"03","Day":"28"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Dementia (London)","NlmUniqueID":"101128698","ISSNLinking":"1471-3012"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"rehabilitation"},{"DescriptorName":"France"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Music Therapy","QualifierName":"methods"},{"DescriptorName":"Treatment Outcome"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["behavioural disorders","dementia","mood","music therapy","psychosocial intervention"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"17","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2013","Month":"12","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"8","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["24337333","1471301212438290","10.1177\/1471301212438290"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"23687183","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2014","Month":"04","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2013","Month":"08","Day":"08"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1938-2731","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"28","Issue":"5","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Aug"}},"Title":"American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen"},"ArticleTitle":"Judging a book by its cover: uniforms and quality of life in special care units for people with dementia.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"450-8"},"ELocationID":"10.1177\/1533317513488915","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["In certain health care facilities, the staff commonly wear uniforms for dementia care. Wearing uniforms are often believed to improve the well-being of institutionalized people with dementia (PwD) by facilitating orientation and preserving hygiene.

This study aims to investigate the impact of wearing uniforms on the quality of life (QoL) of institutionalized PwD.","A natural experimental design was operated in 4 special care units (SCUs) in France. Two SCUs served as an experimental group (caregivers wearing street clothes except when performing hands-on physical care; N = 13) and 2 served as a comparison group (caregivers wearing uniforms; N = 14). The QoL of PwD was measured using the QoL-Alzheimer's Disease scale, and focus groups were carried out with caregivers.","Overall and significantly enhanced QoL scores were observed for the experimental street clothing staff group when compared to the uniform group.

Twenty-five experts attended the conference meeting and reached consensus on a set of 12 QIs representing the key elements of effective psychosocial care, such as shared decision-making and interventions tailored to needs and preferences. Data from 153 patient records showed that all but one QI subitem were applicable to all three settings in both countries.","Our multidisciplinary and multinational strategy resulted in a set of unique QIs that aims exclusively at assessing the quality of psychosocial dementia care.
