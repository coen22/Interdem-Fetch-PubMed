This study investigated social participation in relation to Everyday Technology use and social deprivation of the living environment, among older people with and without dementia in the United Kingdom. Sixty-four people with dementia and sixty-four people without dementia were interviewed using standardized questionnaires: The Participation in ACTivities and Places OUTside Home Questionnaire and Everyday Technology Use Questionnaire. A mixed methods approach integrated statistical analyses and content analysis of free-text responses, through data visualizations. Small, statistically significant associations were found between social participation and Everyday Technology use outside home, for participants with dementia ( = 0.247;  = 0.049) and without dementia ( = 0.343;  = 0.006). A small, statistically significant association was identified between social participation and social deprivation in the living environment, among only participants with dementia ( = 0.267,  = 0.033). The content analysis and graphical joint display revealed motivators, considerations that require extra attention, and strategies for managing social participation. The results underline how Everyday Technology use can be assistive to social participation but also the need to consider social deprivation of the living environment, especially among people with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gaber","ForeName":"Sophie N","Initials":"SN","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Division

for persons with dementia (PwDs) within their family and formal care contexts in Canada. Half-day focus groups were conducted with adult daughters and adult sons in Toronto, Canada. Using constructivist grounded theory, we examined both substantive concepts and group dynamics. Sustaining care was interpreted as an indefinite process with three intertwined themes: reproducing care demands and dependency, enacting and affirming values, and \"flying blind\" in how and how long to sustain caring (i.e., responding to immediate needs with limited foresight). Family values and relationships, mistrust toward the institutional and home care systems, and obscured care foresight influenced care decisions and challenged participants in balancing their parents' needs with their own. Positive and negative aspects of care were found to influence one another. The implications of these findings for research and policy are discussed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hwang","ForeName":"Amy

domains. They can be either an enabler or an obstacle leading to social exclusion. The Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer gathered international experts of dementia care, with backgrounds in biomedical, human and social sciences, to analyze how assistive technologies can address the capabilities of people with dementia, on the basis of their needs. Discussion covered the unmet needs of people with dementia, the domains of daily life activities where assistive technologies can provide help to people with dementia, the enabling and empowering impact of technology to improve their safety and wellbeing, barriers and limits of use, technology assessment, ethical and legal issues. The capability approach (possible freedom) appears particularly relevant in person-centered dementia care and technology development. The focus is not on the solution, rather on what the person can do with it: seeing dementia as disability, with technology as an enabler to promote capabilities of the person, provides a useful framework for both research and practice. This article summarizes how these concepts took momentum in professional practice and public policies in the past 15 years (2000-2015), discusses current issues in the design, development and economic model of assistive technologies for people with dementia, and covers how these technologies are being used and assessed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kenigsberg","ForeName":"Paul-Ariel","Initials":"PA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aquino","ForeName":"Jean-Pierre","Initials":"JP","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"B\u00e9rard","ForeName":"Alain","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Br\u00e9mond","ForeName":"Fran\u00e7ois","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CoBTeK Lab & INRIA STARS, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te-d'Azur, Nice, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Charras","ForeName":"Kevin","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dening","ForeName":"Tom","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Dro\u00ebs","ForeName":"Rose-Marie","Initials":"RM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gzil","ForeName":"Fabrice","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Fondation M\u00e9d\u00e9ric Alzheimer, Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Hicks","ForeName":"Ben","Initials":"B","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Bournemouth University Dementia Institute, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Innes","ForeName":"Anthea","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Salford Institute for Dementia University of Salford, Salford, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nguyen","ForeName":"Sao-Mai","Initials":"SM","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Lab-STICC, Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne, Brest, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurobiology, Care sciences and Society, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pino","ForeName":"Maribel","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Laboratoire Lusage, H\u00f4pital Broca, Assistance publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, France."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sacco","ForeName":"Guillaume","Initials":"G","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Centre M\u00e9moire de Ressources et de Recherche, CHU de Nice;

MCI has been criticised for its conceptual fuzziness, its ambiguous relationship to dementia, and the tension it creates between medical and sociological understandings of \"normal aging\".","We examined the published qualitative literature on experiences of being diagnosed and living with MCI using metasynthesis as the methodological framework.","Two overarching conceptual themes were developed. The first, MCI and myself-in-time, showed that a diagnosis of MCI could profoundly affect a person's understanding of their place in the world. This impact appears to be mediated by multiple factors including a person's social support networks, which daily activities are affected, and subjective interpretations of the meaning of MCI. The second theme, Living with Ambiguity, describes the difficulties people experienced in making sense of their diagnosis. Uncertainty arose, in part, from lack of clarity and consistency in the information received by people with MCI, including whether they are even told MCI is the diagnosis.","We conclude by suggesting an ethical tension is always at play when a MCI diagnosis is made. Specifically, earlier support and services afforded by a diagnosis may come at the expense of a person's anxiety about the future, with continued uncertainty about how his or her concerns and needs can be addressed."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author 2015.

everyday activities using intelligent and pervasive computing technology. AAL research, however, has yet to explore how AAL might support or collaborate with informal care partners (ICPs), such as relatives and friends, who play important roles in the lives and care of persons with dementia (PwDs). In a multiphase codesign process with six (6) ICPs, we envisioned how AAL could be situated to complement their care. We used our codesigned \"caregiver interface\" artefacts as triggers to facilitate envisioning of AAL support and unpack the situated, idiosyncratic context within which AAL aims to assist. Our findings suggest that AAL should be designed to support ICPs in fashioning \"do-it-yourself\" solutions that complement tacitly improvised care strategies and enable them to try, observe, and adapt to solutions over time. In this way, an ICP could decide which activities to entrust to AAL support, when (i.e., scheduled or spontaneous) and how a system should provide support (i.e., using personalized prompts based on care experience), and when adaptations to system support are needed (i.e., based alerting patterns and queried reports). Future longitudinal work employing participatory, design-oriented methods with care dyads is encouraged.

They were identified from photo documentations comprising film sequences and the perspectives of people with dementia. The aim was also to identify how they would understand, interpret and act in these problematic situations based on their previous experiences and linked to the film sequences.A qualitative grounded theory approach was used. Film sequences from five zebra crossings were analysed. The same film sequences were used as triggers in two focus group interviews with persons with dementia. Individual interviews with three informants were also performed.The core category, the hazard of meeting unfolding problematic traffic situations when only one layer at a time can be kept in focus, showed how a problematic situation as a whole consisted of different layers of problematic situations. The first category, adding layers of problematic traffic situations to each other, was characterized by the informants' creation of a problematic situation as a whole. The different layers were described in the subcategories of layout of streets and zebra crossings, weather conditions, vehicles and crowding of pedestrians. The second category, actions used to meet different layers of problematic traffic situations, was characterized by avoiding problematic situations, using traffic lights as reminders and security precautions, following the flow at the zebra crossing and being cautious pedestrians.In conclusion, as community-dwelling people with dementia commonly are pedestrians, it is important that health care professionals and caregivers take their experiences and management of problematic traffic situations into account when providing support.

The aim of this study was to explore how they try to prohibit, avoid or solve problems in everyday technology use, maintain skills, and learn to use new technology. To explore how the participants applied and reasoned about using everyday technology in real-life situations interviews were conducted while the participants used their own technology in their homes. Interviews were conducted with 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u200910) or Alzheimer's disease (n\u2009=\u200910). The analyses were inspired from grounded theory and resulted in one core category and three sub-categories that represent sub-processes in the core. The core finding presents a continuous, intertwined process of learning and using everyday technology, highlighting how the context was interwoven in the processes. The participants used a rich variety of management strategies when approaching technology, including communication with the everyday technologies on different levels. The findings underscore that it is important to support continued use of everyday technology as long as it is valued and relevant to the person with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. The intertwined process of learning and using everyday technology suggests how support could target different sub-processes.

People with dementia have commonly not been included as informants in research as their cognitive deficits have been regarded as a hindrance. Moreover, in the qualitative research tradition, most inquiries rely on data obtained from interviews, thereby requiring communication and verbal skills, which are skills that are affected early in the cause of dementia. Consequently, the considerably under-researched area of how dementia is experienced and managed from the perspective of those afflicted has long been put aside. This paper suggests that a combination of qualitative observations and adapted interviews may make it possible for people with dementia to participate as research informants. Issues concerned with creating a relationship with informants with dementia and helping them to elicit their experiences are elaborated and discussed. Some suggestions are made concerning how the context can be used for this intent, and how the observations and interviews can be adapted to the informants with dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Occupational Therapy, Karolinska institutet, Sweden. louise.nygard@ki.se"}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Scand J Occup Ther","NlmUniqueID":"9502210","ISSNLinking":"1103-8128"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interviews as Topic"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"22","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2006","Month":"12","Day":"9","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2006","Month":"7","Day":"22","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["16856467","10.1080\/11038120600723190"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15315250","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2004","Month":"10","Day":"19"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"06"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0272-9490","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"58","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"MedlineDate":"2004 Jul-Aug"}},"Title":"The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association","ISOAbbreviation":"Am J Occup Ther"},"ArticleTitle":"Responses of persons with dementia to challenges in daily activities: a synthesis of findings from empirical studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"435-45"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["The purpose of this study was to obtain a better understanding of strategies initiated and used in response to problems in performing daily occupations by persons with dementia in a mild to moderate stage.","The results from seven in-depth, qualitative studies conducted by the author and coworkers, describing such response strategies were analyzed and synthesized using aggregated analysis.

To obtain explorative data, interviews and observations in the homes were undertaken with 10 participants diagnosed with dementia. The participants were observed when showing their telephones, calling a well-known number, responding to a request previously sent by letter to make a telephone call, and finding a number in the telephone directories. The data were analysed using a comparative approach, and resulted in descriptive categories. The participants' difficulties were categorized as difficulty in 'knowing what', 'knowing where', 'knowing how' and overcoming motor, perceptual, verbal and environmental obstacles. In responding to these, they used a variety of environmentally related strategies such as using perception or habits and habitual places, verbalizing aloud, seeking help from others, and adjusting the physical environment. They also used a few cognitively related strategies such as repeating and stopping and reflecting. Overall, difficulties were frequent and common, and the effectiveness of the strategies was questionable. The results indicate that it might be unrealistic to assume that elderly persons with symptoms of dementia who live alone are able to satisfactorily use the telephone for safety, communication and participation in society."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Division of Occupational Therapy, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. louise.nygard@neurotec.ki.se"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Starkhammar","ForeName":"Sofia","Initials":"S"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Sweden","MedlineTA":"Scand J Caring Sci","NlmUniqueID":"8804206","ISSNLinking":"0283-9318"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["prevention & control","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Geriatric Assessment"},{"DescriptorName":"Homebound Persons","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Needs Assessment"},{"DescriptorName":"Nursing Methodology Research"},{"DescriptorName":"Problem Solving"},{"DescriptorName":"Residence Characteristics"},{"DescriptorName":"Safety Management"},{"DescriptorName":"Self Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Behavior"},{"DescriptorName":"Social Support"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Sweden"},{"DescriptorName":"Telephone"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"11","Day":"8","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"8","Day":"16","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12919458","177","10.1046\/j.1471-6712.2003.00177.x"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"12603250","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2003","Month":"05","Day":"23"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2015","Month":"12","Day":"11"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0065-1427","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"179","PubDate":{"Year":"2003"}},"Title":"Acta neurologica Scandinavica.

Although people who develop dementia seem to experience subtle changes in complex IADLs long before the disease onset, studies that compare cognitively mildly impaired subjects with demented and nondemented subjects present no clear consensus regarding differentiation according to IADL ability. The traditional ADL\/IADL assessment instruments and techniques seem to present a major problem when the purpose is to predict or differentiate between diagnoses. It is therefore argued that the diagnosis of MCI should include rather than exclude observed or experienced changes in complex everyday life activities."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Nyg\u00e5rd","ForeName":"Louise","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Neurotec, Division of Occupational Therapy, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden. louise.nygard@neurotec.ki.se"}}},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Denmark","MedlineTA":"Acta Neurol Scand Suppl","NlmUniqueID":"0370337","ISSNLinking":"0065-1427"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Activities of Daily Living"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Alzheimer Disease","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Cognition Disorders","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"diagnosis"},{"DescriptorName":"Diagnosis, Differential"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Predictive Value of Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Sensitivity and Specificity"}]},"NumberOfReferences":"33"},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2003","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2003","Month":"5","Day":"24","Hour":"5","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2003","Month":"2","Day":"27","Hour":"4","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["12603250","65"]}}}]}
