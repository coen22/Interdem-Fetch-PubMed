The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched in August 2017 with an updated search in January 2019. Fourteen systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of nonpharmacological interventions were identified. Dementia stage was rated moderate or severe in the majority of the reviews and type of dementia varied. Interventions reported to be effective were cognitive stimulation (QoL: standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.38), music-based therapeutic interventions (depression: SMD = -0.27, anxiety: SMD = -0.43, QoL: SMD = 0.32), and psychological treatments (mainly cognitive behavior therapy; depression: SMD = -0.22, anxiety: MD = -4.57). Although health-care professionals are recommended to continue using these approaches, future research needs to focus on the type and form of interventions that are most effective for different stages and types of dementia."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Kishita","ForeName":"Naoko","Initials":"N","Identifier":"0000-0001-8453-2714","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Backhouse","ForeName":"Tamara","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mioshi","ForeName":"Eneida","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"06","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"United States","MedlineTA":"J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol","NlmUniqueID":"8805645","ISSNLinking":"0891-9887"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Anxiety","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Quality of Life","QualifierName":"psychology"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Alzheimer disease","anxiety","dementia","depression","quality of life","well-being"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"9","Day":"23","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"6","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31203712","10.1177\/0891988719856690"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"29439334","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"25"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"03","Day":"25"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1875-8908","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"62","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2018"}},"Title":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","ISOAbbreviation":"J Alzheimers Dis"},"ArticleTitle":"What Do We Know About Behavioral Crises in Dementia?

Little is known about the factors that are associated with them.","To determine the factors associated with dementia-related behavioral crises.","We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and AMED databases. An additional lateral search including reference lists was conducted. Two researchers screened all records for potential eligibility. Narrative synthesis was used to bring together the findings.","Out of the 5,544 records identified, 24 articles (18 distinct studies) met the eligibility criteria. Aggression and agitation were the most common behaviors present at crises. Delusions, wandering\/absconding, and hallucinations were also key behaviors contributing to crises. Behavioral crises predominantly happened in the severe stages of dementia (according to MMSE scores), in people with dementia residing in their own homes and in long-term care, and were the catalyst for admissions to psychiatric inpatient settings, specialist-care units, long-term care settings, or for referrals to psychiatric community services. Lack of consistency in assessment of behavior, and management of agitation\/aggression in dementia crises were evident.","Interventions to reduce the likelihood of people with dementia-related behaviors reaching crisis point need to focus on both family and care home settings and incorporate aggression and agitation management. Future research should focus on determining the factors that could be addressed to prevent behavioral crises and the interventions and models of care that may help to prevent crises."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Backhouse","ForeName":"Tamara","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Camino","ForeName":"Julieta","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mioshi","ForeName":"Eneida","Initials":"E","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"School of Health Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Systematic Review"]}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"Netherlands","MedlineTA":"J Alzheimers Dis","NlmUniqueID":"9814863","ISSNLinking":"1387-2877"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aggression"},{"DescriptorName":"Crisis Intervention"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["psychology","therapy"]},{"DescriptorName":"Hospitalization"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Problem Behavior"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Behavior","behavioral symptoms","crisis intervention","dementia","hospitalization","institutionalization"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"2","Day":"15","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2019","Month":"3","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29439334","JAD170679","10.3233\/JAD-170679"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"27543054","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2017","Month":"11","Day":"20"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1468-2834","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"45","Issue":"6","PubDate":{"Year":"2016","Month":"11"}},"Title":"Age and ageing","ISOAbbreviation":"Age Ageing"},"ArticleTitle":"The use of non-pharmacological interventions for dementia behaviours in care homes: findings from four in-depth, ethnographic case studies.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"856-863"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["antipsychotic medications have been used to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
