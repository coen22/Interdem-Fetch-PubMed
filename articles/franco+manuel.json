Qualitative methods included: 13 caregivers participating in focus groups, and 3 caregivers in Semi Structured Interviews aimed to understand rotation practices and rejection to long term care institution.","Characteristics related with rotation were: sex of persons with dementia, widowhood, socio-economic status, caregiver relationship and burden of the caregiver. The qualitative study showed that the use of the rotation was related to normative behaviors and with obligation feelings, along with a change in the role of women in the current Spanish family. The use of long term care institutions was related to geographical distance of the family.","The results of this study suggest that rotation has appeared in Spain as a new mechanism of care for people with dementia, and its related to the rejection of long term care institutions."],"CopyrightInformation":"(c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Rivera","ForeName":"Jes\u00fas","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Universidad de Salamanca, Departamento de Sociolog\u00eda y Comunicaci\u00f3n, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Salamanca, Spain. jrivera@usal.es"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bermejo","ForeName":"Felix","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Franco","ForeName":"Manuel","Initials":"M"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Morales-Gonz\u00e1lez","ForeName":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel","Initials":"JM"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Benito-Le\u00f3n","ForeName":"Julian","Initials":"J"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry","NlmUniqueID":"8710629","ISSNLinking":"0885-6230"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adolescent"},{"DescriptorName":"Adult"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cross-Sectional Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"rehabilitation"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Home Nursing","QualifierName":["organization & administration","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Institutionalization"},{"DescriptorName":"Long-Term Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Patient Acceptance of Health Care","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Residence Characteristics"},{"DescriptorName":"Spain"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Young Adult"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2008","Month":"7","Day":"11","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2009","Month":"11","Day":"3","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2008","Month":"7","Day":"11","Hour":"9","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["18615855","10.1002\/gps.2081"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"15799080","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2005","Month":"08","Day":"11"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"01"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"0885-6230","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Print"},"Volume":"20","Issue":"4","PubDate":{"Year":"2005","Month":"Apr"}},"Title":"International journal of geriatric psychiatry","ISOAbbreviation":"Int J Geriatr Psychiatry"},"ArticleTitle":"Factors affecting timely recognition and diagnosis of dementia across Europe: from awareness to stigma.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"377-86"},"Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Timely recognition and diagnosis of dementia is the pre-condition for improving dementia care, but diagnosis often occurs late in the disease process.","To compare facilitators and obstacles to the timely recognition of dementia across eight European Union states, in order to implement established policies for earlier diagnosis.","A modified focus group technique, including a pre and posterior procedure.","Twenty-three participants from different disciplines, purposively sampled for professional expertise in dementia research and innovative practice, attended two focus groups. Stigma in ageing and dementia, accompanied by a sense that there is little to offer until later on in the disease, underpinned the widespread reluctance of GPs to recognise dementia at an early stage and were major obstacles to the timely diagnosis of dementia across all eight countries. Dementia care services varied widely across Europe. Countries with the greatest development of dementia health care services were characterised by national guidelines, GPs fulfilling a gatekeeper function, multi-disciplinary memory clinics and innovative programmes that stimulated practice and new services. Dementia-related stigma was perceived as being less prominent in these countries.","Overcome of delays in the timely diagnosis of dementia needs more than specialist services. They should address the processes associated with stigma, age and dementia, especially where these relate to physician practice and diagnostic disclosure.
