The aim of the study was to identify dementia-specific characteristics of patients with fall-related femur fractures and additionally an unspecified dementia in order to gain further knowledge about this particular patient group.","A\u00a0descriptive explorative case study with a\u00a0single case-embedded design based on routine hospital data from a\u00a0university hospital was performed. A\u00a0total number of 34\u00a0patient records from 2015 were analyzed. In the embedded unit of analysis\u00a0I the data of selected items of the nursing assessment AcuteCare (ePA-AC\u00a9) were descriptively analyzed for the time of admission and discharge. In the embedded unit of analysis\u00a0II a\u00a0summarizing inductive content analysis was conducted.","The results of the embedded unit of analysis\u00a0I showed that this patient group is characterized by a\u00a0high need for care, changes of cognition and behavioral symptoms. The status of cognition, behavior and reciprocity as well as the self-care index stagnated or deteriorated in many patients from admission to discharge. The embedded unit of analysis\u00a0II identified observable (social)behavior, (non)compliance and orientation as central dementia-specific characteristics.","The results reflect the complexity of the care situation of patients with unspecified dementia in acute care hospitals.

A process evaluation of the context, the recruitment and target populations reached (residents and nursing staff) and the delivery of the intervention and implementation strategy was carried out to explore the lack of effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA on the residents' prevalence of BPSD.","This study was part of a larger process evaluation using a mixed-methods design. Standardised questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, attendance lists, standardised protocols and written self-reports were used to collect the data. The quantitative data were analysed by calculating descriptive statistics. The qualitative interviews were analysed using deductive content analysis and the self-reports were analysed using a documentary analysis.","None of the NHs had prior experience with dementia-specific case conferences on a specific concept related to BPSD. The number of residents for whom a dementia-specific case conference was held was lower than expected. The number of nursing staff reached was high, although as defined in the study protocol, core nursing teams continuously participating in all components of the intervention were not established throughout the study. An analysis of the delivery of the intervention showed a reduction in the frequency of dementia-specific case conferences and deviations in the process structure and role structure of WELCOME-IdA. The strategy used to facilitate the implementation of WELCOME-IdA was mostly followed. An analysis of the recruitment of residents indicated that the variation in which residents were included in the study sample was high and that the intended sample size required to achieve a power\u2009>80% was not reached.","An analysis of the process evaluation data indicated that there were inaccuracies in the implementation of WELCOME-IdA and there were methodological limitations within the design of the effectiveness trial, both of which could explain the lack of effectiveness of WELCOME-IdA. To optimise the process structure of WELCOME-IdA, an assessment of BPSD and a pre-selection of possible domains for the behavioural analysis could be conducted prior to a dementia-specific case conference.","ISRCTN20203855 .

These informal care arrangements, which are mostly coordinated by informal carers, are the backbone of home-based dementia care. Creating and maintaining stability is an underlying theme in informal care; however, a definition of the complex phenomenon of 'stability' in this context is still lacking.","The aim was to develop a working definition of stability of home-based care arrangements for people with dementia, which can be applied in current and future research projects at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Witten (DZNE Witten) and others.","Ensuing from prior research a preliminary version of the definition was formulated. This definition was discussed in a focus group of scientific experts with expertise in dementia research and care (n\u2009=\u20098). After data analysis using content analysis, the definition was revised during a scientific colloquium (n\u2009=\u200918) and a consensus was finally reached.","There were four major themes which were considered by the experts as being relevant for the definition of stability: (1) creating and maintaining stability as a continuous adaptation process, (2) a qualitative component of stability, (3) persons with dementia and informal carers as pivotal players and (4) transitions to residential care.","The working definition introduced in this article reflects the authors' understanding of the phenomenon of stability of home-based care arrangements for people with dementia. In times of increasing need for evidence-based interventions it is necessary to develop elaborated definitions of complex phenomena in order to be able to systematically evaluate the efficacy of interventions on the basis of a common understanding."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"von Kutzleben","ForeName":"Milena","Initials":"M","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Arbeitsgruppe Versorgungsstrukturen, Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.\u00a0V.
