Regular monitoring of antipsychotic prescribing has been shown to improve the appropriateness of prescribing. However, there is currently no consensus on what the components of such a monitoring tool would be.","The aim of this study was to use an expert consensus process to identify the key components of an antipsychotic repeat prescribing tool for use with people with dementia in a general practice setting.","A modified eDelphi technique was employed. We invited multidisciplinary experts in antipsychotic prescribing to people with dementia to participate. These experts included general practitioners (GPs), geriatricians and old age psychiatrists. The list of statements for round 1 was developed through a review of existing monitoring tools and international best practice guidelines. In the second round of the Delphi, any statement that had not reached consensus in the first round was presented for re-rating, with personalized feedback on the group and the individual's response to the specific statement. The final round consisted of a face-to-face expert meeting to resolve any uncertainties from round 2.","A total of 23 items were rated over two eDelphi rounds and one face-to-face consensus meeting to yield a total of 18 endorsed items and five rejected items. The endorsed statements informed the development of a structured, repeat prescribing tool for monitoring antipsychotics in people with dementia in primary care.","The development of repeat prescribing tool provides GPs with practical advice that is lacking in current guidelines and will help to support GPs by providing a structured format to use when reviewing antipsychotic prescriptions for people with dementia, ultimately improving patient care. The feasibility and acceptability of the tool now need to be evaluated in clinical practice."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jennings","ForeName":"Aisling A","Initials":"AA","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland, aisling.jennings@ucc.ie."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Guerin","ForeName":"Naoihse","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland, aisling.jennings@ucc.ie."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Foley","ForeName":"Tony","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland, aisling.jennings@ucc.ie."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"23"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"New Zealand","MedlineTA":"Clin Interv Aging","NlmUniqueID":"101273480","ISSNLinking":"1176-9092"},"ChemicalList":{"Chemical":{"RegistryNumber":"0","NameOfSubstance":"Antipsychotic Agents"}},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Antipsychotic Agents","QualifierName":["adverse effects","therapeutic use"]},{"DescriptorName":"Consensus"},{"DescriptorName":"Delivery of Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Delphi Technique"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"drug therapy"},{"DescriptorName":"General Practice"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interdisciplinary Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Intersectoral Collaboration"},{"DescriptorName":"Ireland"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["antipsychotics","consensus","dementia","eDelphi","general practice","prescribing"]},"CoiStatement":"Disclosure AAJ received a PhD stipend as part of the grant awarded by Atlantic Philanthropies and the Health Service Executive (Ireland), and received 3-year career research grant from the Irish College of General Practitioners (2017\u20132020).

develop interprofessional education (IPE) to support collaborative dementia care in the community. The aim of this short report is to describe the development and pilot evaluation of an interprofessional dementia education workshop for primary care healthcare professionals. A three-hour workshop was iteratively developed through consultation with an expert reference group and people with dementia. The workshop was piloted with three separate primary care teams. A total of fifty-four primary care based healthcare staff who represented fourteen different health care roles in primary care participated in the pilot evaluation. The pilot workshops were evaluated using a mixed method approach which included post-workshop questionnaires for participants (n= 54)and a post-workshop focus group (n=8) with the program design team and workshop facilitators. The results of the pilot phase indicated that the workshop was useful and feasible. The workshop improved participants' self-reported knowledge, understanding and confidence to support people with dementia and their families.Areas for improvement were identified and will be used to inform improvements to the workshop content and delivery in advance of a national roll-out. Future evaluations of the implementation of this interprofessional educational workshop will focus on its impact on healthcare professional behavior and outcomes for the person with dementia and their families."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jennings","ForeName":"Aisling","Initials":"A","Identifier":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9246-3955","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McLoughlin","ForeName":"Kathleen","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Boyle","ForeName":"Siobhan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Thackeray","ForeName":"Katherine","Initials":"K","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Quinn","ForeName":"Anne","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Advanced Nurse Practitioner in Dementia, Health Service Executive , Clonmel, Tipperary , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Sullivan","ForeName":"Trish","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Neurological Services, Health Service Executive Cork South Lee , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Foley","ForeName":"Tony","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of General Practice, University College Cork , Cork , Ireland."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Interprof Care","NlmUniqueID":"9205811","ISSNLinking":"1356-1820"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Curriculum"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Focus Groups"},{"DescriptorName":"Health Personnel","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interprofessional Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Pilot Projects"},{"DescriptorName":"Primary Health Care"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Development"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Interprofessional education (IPE)","community care","dementia","evaluation","pilot","primary care"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"2","Day":"28","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["30422731","10.1080\/13561820.2018.1541876"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"30321219","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2019","Month":"04","Day":"04"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2019","Month":"04","Day":"04"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic-eCollection"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1932-6203","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"13","Issue":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2018"}},"Title":"PloS one","ISOAbbreviation":"PLoS One"},"ArticleTitle":"Consultations on driving in people with cognitive impairment in primary care: A scoping review of the evidence.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"e0205580"},"ELocationID":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0205580","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["To review the empirical evidence on approaches used by Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) in fitness to drive (FtD) consultations with people living with cognitive impairment.","Scoping review of empirical literature focused on primary studies of any design.","Primary care practice.","PCPs or their equivalent and\/ or individuals with cognitive impairment across the spectrum of mild cognitive impairment to dementia.","Systematic search of Medline, Cinahl, PsychINFO, Academic Search Complete, Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection, SocIndex and Social Sciences FT were conducted.

Synthesized data showed PCPs have mixed feelings on the appropriateness of their role in FtD assessments, with many feeling particularly uncomfortable and lacking confidence in the context of possible cognitive impairment. Reasons include lack of familiarity with legal requirements and local resources; fear of damaging the doctor-patient relationship; and impact on the patient's quality of life.

The aim of this study was to explore GPs' knowledge and attitudes towards pain assessment and management in people with dementia.","This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was adapted from a previous study and piloted with 5 GPs. The questionnaire was posted to a census sample of all GPs in Cork city and county in the southern region of Ireland. The questionnaire collected demographic information, responses to a series of Likert-type statements assessing GPs' knowledge and attitudes, and provided an opportunity for the GP to give qualitative feedback on their experiences of managing pain in dementia. SPSS v25 was used for statistical analysis. Qualitative responses were thematically analysed.","Of the 320 questionnaires posted, 157 completed questionnaires were returned (response rate of 49%). The sample was representative of GPs nationally in terms of years in GP practice and practice location. Over two-thirds (108\/157) of respondents had a nursing home commitment. Only 10% of respondents (16\/157) were aware of any dementia-specific pain assessment tools. The larger the nursing home commitment of the GP the more likely they were to be familiar with these tools (p\u2009=\u20090.048). The majority of respondents (113\/157) believed people with dementia could not self-report pain. Respondents were uncertain about the safety of using opioid medications to treat pain in people with dementia with only 51.6% agreeing that they were safe. The qualitative comments highlighted the importance the GPs placed on surrogate reports of pain, GPs' uncertainty regarding the value of formal pain assessment tools and the challenges caused by under-resourcing in general practice.","This study has highlighted aspects of pain assessment and management in dementia that GPs find challenging. Guidance on pain assessment and management in people with dementia do not appear to be translating into clinical practice. The findings will inform educational interventions being developed by our research team as part of the implementation of the Irish national dementia strategy. The knowledge and attitudes of general practitioners to the assessment and management of pain in people with

the workload of general practitioners (GPs) in dementia care is set to increase. However, there are many aspects of dementia care that GPs find challenging. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) affect the majority of people with dementia and is an aspect of dementia care that GPs find particularly difficult to manage. The aim of this mixed methods systematic review is to undertake a synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies on GPs' knowledge, attitudes and experiences of managing BPSD.","Seven electronic bibliographic databases will be searched from inception to present. All qualitative or quantitative studies that explore the knowledge, attitude or experiences of GPs towards the management of BPSD in community and\/or residential settings will be eligible for inclusion. A meta-ethnography will be conducted to synthesise included studies. Primary outcome measures will include GPs' experiences of managing BPSD, GPs' knowledge of BPSD and their attitude to different approaches to the management of BPSD, in particular their attitude to non-pharmacological approaches. All included papers will be independently assessed for methodological validity by two reviewers using the following tools: the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for qualitative research, the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool for intervention studies and the National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool for observational and analytical cross-sectional studies. As there is no agreed quality assessment tool for descriptive cross-sectional studies, an original tool will be developed. Two independent reviewers will apply the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) tool to the review findings. The results will be reported in line with the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) statement.","This study will be the first systematic review that synthesises the existing literature of GPs' knowledge, attitudes and experiences of managing BPSD in community and residential care. This review will improve our understanding of GPs' perspectives on the management of BPSD, and the results will be used to inform the development of an intervention to improve the management of BPSD in general practice.","PROSPERO CRD42017054916 ."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jennings","ForeName":"Aisling

GPs were purposively recruited to include participants with differing levels of experience caring for people with BPSD in nursing homes and in community settings to provide maximum diversity of views. Interviews were analysed thematically.","three main challenges of managing BPSD were identified; lack of clinical guidance, stretched resources and difficulties managing expectations. The lack of relevant clinical guidance available affected GPs' confidence when managing BPSD. In the absence of appropriate resources GPs felt reliant upon sedative medications. GPs believed their advocacy role was further compromised by the difficulties they experienced managing expectations of family caregivers and nursing home staff.","this study helps to explain the apparent discrepancy between best practice recommendations in BPSD and real-life practice. It will be used to inform the design of an intervention to support the management of BPSD in general practice."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 The Author 2017.

integrated care in the community, means that general practitioners (GPs) are playing an increasing and pivotal role in dementia care. However, GPs are challenged by dementia care and have identified it as an area of learning need. We describe the development, roll-out and evaluation of peer-facilitated workshops for GPs, as part of a national programme to support GPs in their delivery of dementia care.","Informed by a triangulated educational needs analysis, small-group case-based workshops were designed. Five GPs were trained as facilitators and delivered workshops in GP practices within their own locality. A mixed-methods evaluation was undertaken, incorporating participant completion of post-workshop questionnaires along with the collection and analysis of qualitative data obtained from a focus group with workshop facilitators.","104 GPs attended 39 workshops (median attendance number 3, range 2-9). The majority of participants reported an improvement in their knowledge and confidence in dementia care. In particular, participants felt that workshop content was relevant and they liked peer-facilitation within their own practices. Facilitators emphasised the importance of skilful facilitation of sensitive topics and described the tension between being regarded as a facilitator and a subject expert.","The findings of this study indicate that practice-based, peer-facilitated, small-group workshops improve self-reported knowledge and confidence in dementia care and are well-received by GPs. Findings further suggest that similar educational approaches may be effective in supporting GPs in other areas of complex chronic care in general practice."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Foley","ForeName":"Tony","Initials":"T","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of General Practice , University College Cork, National University of Ireland , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jennings","ForeName":"Aisling","Initials":"A","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of General Practice , University College Cork, National University of Ireland , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Boyle","ForeName":"Siobhan","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of General Practice , University College Cork, National University of Ireland , Cork , Ireland."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Smithson","ForeName":"W Henry","Initials":"WH","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Department of General Practice , University College Cork, National University of Ireland , Cork , Ireland."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"20"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Educ Prim Care","NlmUniqueID":"101141280","ISSNLinking":"1473-9879"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Curriculum"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia"},{"DescriptorName":"Education","QualifierName":"organization & administration"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"General Practitioners","QualifierName":"education"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Ireland"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Peer Group"},{"DescriptorName":"Program Evaluation"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Dementia","continuing education","evaluation","general practice","peer learning","problem based small group learning"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"22","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"21","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["29050541","10.1080\/14739879.2017.1390693"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"28532475","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2018","Month":"03","Day":"16"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"11","Day":"13"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1471-2296","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"18","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2017","Month":"May","Day":"22"}},"Title":"BMC family practice","ISOAbbreviation":"BMC Fam Pract"},"ArticleTitle":"\"We're certainly not in our comfort zone\": a qualitative study of GPs' dementia-care educational needs.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"66"},"ELocationID":"10.1186\/s12875-017-0639-8","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["Rising dementia prevalence rates rise combined with the policy objective of enabling people with dementia to remain living at home, means that there will be a growing demand for dementia care in the community setting.

Previous studies of GPs dementia care educational needs have explored the views of GPs alone, without taking the perspectives of people with dementia and family carers into account. The aim of the study was to explore GPs' dementia care educational needs, as viewed from multiple perspectives, in order to inform the design and delivery of an educational programme for GPs.","A qualitative study of GPs, people with dementia and family carers in a community setting was undertaken. Face-to-face interviews were performed with GPs, people with dementia and with family carers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.","Thirty-one people were interviewed, consisting of fourteen GPs, twelve family carers and five people with dementia. GPs expressed a wish for further education, preferentially through small group workshops. Five distinct educational needs emerged from the interviews, namely, diagnosis, disclosure, signposting of local services, counselling and the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD). While GPs focused on diagnosis, disclosure and BPSD in particular, people with dementia and family carers emphasised the need for GPs to engage in counselling and signposting of local services.","The triangulation of data from multiple relevant sources revealed a broader range of GPs' educational needs, incorporating both medical and social aspects of dementia care. The findings of this study will inform the content and delivery of a dementia educational programme for GPs that is practice-relevant, by ensuring that the curriculum meets the needs of GPs, patients
