Loneliness and social isolation are associated with depression and anxiety, while difficulties communicating may magnify such difficulties. Enhancing meaningful interactions may support maintenance of valued relationships and positive wellbeing. Although previous research has examined communicative experiences, this has been from the perspectives of professionals or caregivers. Exploring meaningful communication from the perspectives of people with dementia is crucial in supporting relationships and wellbeing. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: People with dementia can be active participants in research. They are aware of their cognitive impairments as well as social interactions and features constituting meaningful communications. People with dementia recognized carers' attempts to understand and empathize with them; allowing them to feel valued and heard, empowering them to maintain interactions. Alternatively, feeling dismissed, inferior or pressured to provide 'correct' responses deterred them from further conversations. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: People with dementia have an awareness of their relationships, communications and preferences. Thus, it is imperative to respect this population and make attempts to understand their communication as they sense this effort even when miscommunications occur. Embrace qualities that facilitate person-centred care within communications is vital as this can preserve valued relationships, support one's needs and enhance wellbeing. Such features include active listening, empathizing, being physically and mentally present, spending time to know the individual and sharing experiences, thoughts and emotions. Abstract Introduction Social isolation can be problematic for people with dementia; understanding what makes communication meaningful may reduce such risk. Scientific rationale Previous research has examined caregivers' or professionals' experiences of meaningful communication. Understanding this from the perspectives of people with dementia could enhance their interactions and wellbeing. Aim Exploring what makes communication meaningful from the perspective of people with dementia. Methods Nine dyadic interactions between a person with dementia and a family carer were filmed. Individuals with dementia watched the footage and reflected on their communications in semi-structured interviews. Results Three superordinate themes emerged. Themes 'sharing moments of emotional connection' and 'empowering one's ability to communicate' related to the experience of feeling connected, understood, valued and heard, allowing further communication. Conversely, 'inhibitors to communication' related feeling disempowered and reduced interactions. Discussion Even when carers could not understand what people with dementia attempted to communicate, their efforts to interact with them were valued and considered meaningful as they reinforce their sense of connectedness. Implications for practice Embracing a person-centred approach by actively attuning to the person and continuously attempting to empathize and understand persons with dementia can help preserve important relationships and allow the person to feel valued and interpersonally connected.","CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Alsawy","ForeName":"Sarah","Initials":"S","Identifier":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8418-7858","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CeNTrUM (Centre for New Treatments and Understanding in Mental Health), Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tai","ForeName":"Sara","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CeNTrUM (Centre for New Treatments and Understanding in Mental Health), Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"McEvoy","ForeName":"Phil","Initials":"P","Identifier":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9052-6353","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Six Degrees Social Enterprise, Southwood House, Salford, UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Mansell","ForeName":"Warren","Initials":"W","Identifier":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5697-1784","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"CeNTrUM (Centre for New Treatments and Understanding in Mental Health), Division of Psychology and Mental Health, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2019","Month":"09","Day":"29"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"9439514","ISSNLinking":"1351-0126"},"CitationSubset":"N","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Communication"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Disabled Persons","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Qualitative Research"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["communication with family carers","film of interaction","interview","perspective of people with dementia"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"received"},"Year":"2019","Month":"05","Day":"06"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"revised"},"Year":"2019","Month":"07","Day":"10"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"accepted"},"Year":"2019","Month":"08","Day":"23"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2020","Month":"11","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2019","Month":"8","Day":"27","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["31449719","10.1111\/jpm.12559"]},"ReferenceList":{"Title":"REFERENCES","Reference":[{"Citation":"Alsawy, S., Mansell, W., McEvoy, P., & Tai, S.
