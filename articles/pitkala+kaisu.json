Professionals should pay attention to DAPs, since evidence on their adverse effects has been accumulating during the last decade. However, to our knowledge previous studies exploring temporal trends in the use of DAPs are scarce.","The aim of this study was to assess temporal trends in the use of DAPs from 2003 to 2017 in long-term care facilities in Helsinki.","Four cross-sectional studies were conducted in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2017. Participants included older people (\u2265\u200965\u00a0years) living in nursing homes (NHs) in 2003 (n\u2009=\u20091979), 2011 (n\u2009=\u20091568), and 2017 (n\u2009=\u2009750), and in assisted living facilities (ALFs) in 2007 (n\u2009=\u20091336), 2011 (n\u2009=\u20091556), and 2017 (n\u2009=\u20091673) in Helsinki, Finland. Data on demographics, medication use, and diagnoses were collected by structured questionnaires. The assessments were conducted as a point prevalence over 1\u00a0day. The use of DAPs and the total anticholinergic burden were defined by the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS).","In ALFs, there has been an increasing trend in the use of DAPs over a 10-year period (41.2% in 2007 and 53.7% in 2017). In NHs, by contrast, the use of DAPs remained quite stable (52.3% in 2003 and 52.4% in 2017). The burden of DAPs measured by ARS score decreased in NHs and remained stable in ALFs. Marked changes occurred in the DAPs used; antidepressants, especially mirtazapine, increased in both settings, whereas the use of hydroxyzine and urinary antispasmodics nearly disappeared. The proportion of users of DAP antipsychotics increased in ALFs. Participants with dementia had a lower anticholinergic burden than those without dementia, in both settings.","Despite increased knowledge of the harms of DAPs, they remain widely used. Physicians seem to be aware of the harms of DAPs among people with dementia, and some other favorable trends in prescribing were also observed. Clinicians should especially consider the indications behind the use of DAP antidepressants and antipsychotics, and carefully weigh their potential benefits and harms."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Aalto","ForeName":"Ulla

diagnosis of CHD or stroke and over half use at least one preventative cardiovascular medication. There have been no studies that have investigated the longitudinal change in secondary preventative cardiovascular medication use in residents in LTCFs over time.","The aim of this study was to investigate the change in cardiovascular medication use among residents with coronary heart disease (CHD) and prior stroke in nursing homes (NHs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs) in Finland over time, and whether this change differs according to dementia status.","Three comparable cross-sectional audits of cardiovascular medication use among residents aged 65\u00a0years and over with CHD or prior stroke in NHs in 2003 and 2011 and ALFs in 2007 and 2011 were compared. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, mobility, cancer and length of stay were performed to examine the effect of study year, dementia and their interaction on medication use.","Cardiovascular medication use among residents with CHD (NHs: 89% vs 70%; ALFs: 89% vs 84%) and antithrombotic medication use among residents with stroke (NHs: 72% vs 63%; ALFs: 78% vs 69%) declined between 2003 and 2011 in NHs and 2007 and 2011 in ALFs.\u00a0Decline in the use of diuretics, nitrates and digoxin were found in both groups and settings. Cardiovascular medication use among residents with CHD and dementia declined in NHs (88% [95% CI 85-91] in 2003 vs 70% [95% CI 64-75] in 2011) whereas there was no change among people without dementia. There was no change in cardiovascular medication use among residents with CHD in ALFs with or without dementia over time. Antithrombotic use was lower in residents with dementia compared with residents without dementia in NHs (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and ALFs (p\u2009=\u20090.026); however, the interaction between dementia diagnosis and time was non-significant.","The decline in cardiovascular medication use in residents with CHD and dementia suggests Finnish physicians are adopting a more conservative approach to the management of cardiovascular disease in the NH population."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Jokanovic","ForeName":"Natali","Initials":"N","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"Centre for Medicine Use and Safety, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

(FRDs) on falls among people with Alzheimer's disease (AD).","The aim of this study was to investigate how exercise intervention and FRDs interact with fall risk among patients with AD.","In the FINALEX trial, community-dwelling persons with AD received either home-based or group-based exercise twice weekly for 1\u00a0year (n\u2009=129); the control group received normal care (n\u2009=65). The number of falls was based on spouses' fall diaries. We examined the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for falls among both non-users and users of various FRDs (antihypertensives, psychotropics, drugs with anticholinergic properties [DAPs]) in both control and combined intervention groups.","Between the intervention and control groups, there was no difference in the number of falls among those without antihypertensives or psychotropics. In the intervention group taking antihypertensives, the IRR was 0.5 falls\/person-year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.6), while in the control group, the IRR was 1.5 falls\/person-year (95% CI 1.2-1.8) [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for group, p\u00a0=\u00a00.067 for medication, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for interaction]. Among patients using psychotropics, the intervention group had an IRR of 0.7 falls\/person-year (95% CI 0.6-0.9), while the control group had an IRR of 2.0 falls\/person-year (95% CI 1.6-2.5) [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for group, p\u00a0=\u00a00.071 for medication, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for interaction]. There was a significant difference in falls between the intervention and control groups not using DAPs (0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7; 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4), and between the intervention and control groups using DAPs (1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.3; 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.1) [p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for group, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014 for medication, p\u2009\u00a0=\u00a00.97 for interaction].","Exercise has the potential to decrease

effects on cognition in healthy adults. Less is known about the effectiveness of exercise interventions in older individuals already suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. The aim of this study was to systematically review the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the effects of physical exercise on cognition in older subjects with MCI or dementia. PubMed, Cochrane and DARE databases were systematically searched for RCTs using terms related to cognition and physical exercise. Altogether, 22 trials were found. The studies on older subjects with MCI reported some positive effects of physical exercise on cognition, mainly on global cognition, executive function, attention and delayed recall. However, most studies performed on older subjects with dementia showed no effect of exercise on cognition. The studies had methodological problems in defining dementia\/MCI diagnosis, blinding, inadequate sample sizes and not reporting dropouts, compliance or complications. More studies of good quality on older adults with dementia are needed."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"\u00d6hman","ForeName":"Hanna","Initials":"H","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Rehabilitation

Commonly included are frailty, dementia, delirium, incontinence, falls, and dizziness. Geriatric syndromes are common among older people: in a recent survey, 50% of those aged more than 65 had one or more of these conditions. Better methods for prevention and treatment are needed, but current strategies have lacked a coherent conceptual and diagnostic framework. Prevention and interventions need to be targeted at earlier ages, with geriatrics expertise needed in the definition and operationalization of these complex entities. In this review we consolidate evidence that vascular disorders, including vascular ageing and vascular diseases, are key etiological factors of geriatric syndromes. Identifying this vascular dimension would offer opportunities for more efficient preventive strategies and mandates earlier intervention, especially for women, among whom vascular disease is often expressed more insidiously than among men. This would entail a sensitization of the health care system to the systematic detection of the syndromes, which are currently underdiagnosed. Further disentangling of the mechanisms of vascular ageing may offer therapies for vascular diseases and geriatric syndromes alike."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Strandberg","ForeName":"Timo E","Initials":"TE","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Medicine, Geriatric Clinic, University of Helsinki, and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland. timo.strandberg@oulu.fi"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Pitk\u00e4l\u00e4","ForeName":"Kaisu H","Initials":"KH"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Tilvis","ForeName":"Reijo S","Initials":"RS"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"O'Neill","ForeName":"Desmond","Initials":"D"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Erkinjuntti","ForeName":"Timo J","Initials":"TJ"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Review"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2012","Month":"10","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Ann Med","NlmUniqueID":"8906388","ISSNLinking":"0785-3890"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Accidental Falls"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aging","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Apathy","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Delirium","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Depression","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dizziness","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Fractures, Bone","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Frail Elderly"},{"DescriptorName":"Gait","QualifierName":"physiology"},{"DescriptorName":"Hearing Disorders","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Osteoporosis","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Syndrome"},{"DescriptorName":"Urinary Incontinence","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Vascular Diseases","QualifierName":"physiopathology"},{"DescriptorName":"Vision Disorders","QualifierName":"physiopathology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2012","Month":"10","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2012","Month":"10","Day":"18","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"11","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["23072364","10.3109\/07853890.2012.727022"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22960590","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"06","Day":"24"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2018","Month":"12","Day":"02"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1873-6815","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"48","Issue":"1","PubDate":{"Year":"2013","Month":"Jan"}},"Title":"Experimental gerontology","ISOAbbreviation":"Exp Gerontol"},"ArticleTitle":"Efficacy of physical exercise intervention on mobility and physical functioning in older people with dementia: a systematic review.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"85-93"},"ELocationID":["10.1016\/j.exger.2012.08.008","S0531-5565(12)00233-1"],"Abstract":{"AbstractText":"Numerous trials have shown that physical activity and exercise training have beneficial effects in general older populations.

Sessions may include topics on dementia, community services, active lifestyle and prevention for cognitive decline, spousal relationship, future planning and emotional well-being. The patients and spouses will have their separate group sessions (ten participants per group) once a week for eight weeks.

Demographic factors, physical functioning, diagnoses, and drugs were assessed with special reference for dementia, delirium, and apathy. Mortality was registered from central registers.","Of the patients, 98 (23.1%) suffered from apathy, and it was more frequent among men (32% versus 21% women, P = .037 ). There was no difference in mean age, number of comorbidities, or in the mean number of medications between those with and without apathy; however, those with apathy had lower mean MMSE points (9.2 versus 14.0 without apathy, P < .001), more often severe dementia according to Clinical Dementia Rating, and higher dependence in activities of daily living (P = .001). Furthermore, patients with apathy were more often suffering from delirium (37.8% versus 21.1%, P \u2264 .001). Mortality during the 1-year follow-up was 34.7% (n = 34) and 22.0% (n = 72) among individuals with and without apathy, respectively (P = .011).

A model to calculate sedative load has been developed to quantify the cumulative effect of taking multiple drugs with sedative properties. The objective of this study was to describe the sedative load and use of sedative and psychotropic drugs among long-term care facility residents with and without dementia.","Cross-sectional data were collected from all 53 long-term care wards in Helsinki, Finland, in September 2003. Of the 1444 eligible residents, consent to participate was obtained for 1087 (75%) residents. Medication and diagnostic data were available for 1052 residents. All drugs were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Sedative load was calculated for each resident using a previously published four-group model.","Of the 1052 residents, 781 (74.2%) were determined to have dementia. Residents with and without dementia had a similar sedative load (mean 3.0 vs 2.7, p = 0.267), but residents with dementia were taking fewer drugs than residents without dementia (mean 6.7 vs 7.4, p = 0.011). Residents with dementia were more frequent users of antipsychotics (42.8% vs 32.8%, p = 0.004), but less frequent users of antidepressants (35.6% vs 46.1%, p = 0.002) and sedative-hypnotics (22.8% vs 27.7%, p = 0.003) than residents without dementia. The most frequently used primary sedatives among people with dementia were temazepam (n = 122, 15.6%), oxazepam (n = 98, 12.5%) and lorazepam (n = 95, 12.2%). The most frequently used drugs with sedation as a prominent adverse effect or preparations with a sedating component among people with dementia were citalopram (n = 183, 23.4%), risperidone (n = 155, 19.8%) and olanzapine (n = 73, 9.3%).","Residents with dementia were less frequent users of sedative-hypnotic drugs than residents without dementia. However, residents with and without dementia had a similar sedative load. Clinicians should be aware of the extent to which all individual drugs, not only those prescribed for intentional sedation, contribute to a resident's sedative load. The very high rates of sedative and psychotropic use observed in long-term care facility residents highlight the need for new strategies to optimize drug use."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bell","ForeName":"J Simon","Initials":"JS","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Kuopio Research

This study uses the updated Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate drug (PID) use in older adults to determine the extent and nature of PIDs in older nursing home residents in Helsinki, Finland. The study also uses the Swedish, Finnish, INteraction X-referencing (SFINX) interaction database to assess the possibility of clinically significant class D (\"clinically significant interaction, and the combination should be avoided\") drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in the same population.","This study is a cross-sectional assessment of all nursing home residents aged > or = 65 years in Helsinki. The residents' demographic information and medical data were collected from medical charts in February 2003.","Of all nursing home residents in Helsinki, 82% (n = 1987) were eligible for analysis. Their mean age was 83.7 (SD 7.7) years, 80.7% were female and 69.5% were diagnosed with dementia. The mean number of drugs given on a regular basis per resident was 7.9 (SD 3.6) per day. Of the study population, 34.9% regularly used at least one PID. Residents taking PIDs were more likely to be taking psychotropic medication and to be taking nine or more drugs daily, and less likely to have a diagnosis of dementia, than patients not taking PIDs. The three most prevalent PIDs were: (i) short-acting benzodiazepines in greater than recommended doses (13.9% of all residents), of which temazepam >15 mg\/day was the most commonly used agent and, indeed, the most common PID (taken by 13.5% of all residents); (ii) hydroxyzine (7.1%); and (iii) nitrofurantoin (6.3%). Together, these three PIDs accounted for 76.9% of all PID use. Of all residents, 4.8% were susceptible to a clinically significant DDI. The most common potential DDIs were related to the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, carbamazepine and codeine. Compared with residents not exposed to potential DDIs, residents exposed to potential DDIs were more likely to be younger, to have a prior history of stroke, to be taking psychotropics, to be taking nine or more drugs daily and to be taking PIDs.","Use of PIDs is very common among nursing home residents, and this increases the likelihood of DDIs.

with Alzheimer's disease, the support and services received, the unmet needs, and the caregivers' satisfaction with the services are examined. The study included a survey of a random sample of 1943 caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease in Finland. Mean age of the caregivers was 78.2 years, and 35% had poor subjective health. Disabilities and behavioral symptoms were common among the spouses with Alzheimer's disease. The services most often offered were financial support (36%), technical devices (33%), physiotherapy (32%), and respite care in nursing homes (31%). Most often needed services were physiotherapy for the spouse with dementia (56%), financial support (50%), house-cleaning (41%), and home respite (40%). Only 39% of the caregivers were satisfied with the services, and 69% felt they did not have any influence on what services were offered.

Recently, serious concerns have been raised about the stroke and mortality risk of atypical antipsychotics when administered to patients with dementia.","The aim of this study was to examine the impact of atypical and conventional antipsychotics on mortality and hospital admissions among Finnish elderly institutionalized patients with dementia in a two-year follow up and to compare their prognosis with that of nonusers.","The authors examined 254 very frail patients with dementia, mean age 86 years, from seven Finnish nursing homes and two hospitals in 1999-2000. Medical records provided information on the use of daily antipsychotic medication; central registers confirmed mortality for up to two years.","Nearly one-half (48.4%) of the patients used antipsychotic medication: 37.4% received conventional neuroleptics (N = 95) and 11.0% received atypical antipsychotics (N = 28). The mean number of hospital admissions was higher among the nonusers than among the users of conventional or atypical antipsychotics. Of the users of atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine), 32.1% died within 2 years. The respective figures for users of conventional neuroleptics were 45.3%, and for the nonusers, 49.6%. In the Cox proportional hazard model, a high number of medications and the use of physical restraint predicted higher mortality at two years. The use of atypical antipsychotics showed lower risk of mortality, if any. The respective test for conventional antipsychotics was nonsignificant.","Among these frail and very old patients with dementia, neither the use of atypical antipsychotics nor the use of conventional neuroleptics increased mortality or hospital admissions.
