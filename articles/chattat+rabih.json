However, instruments for measuring outcomes of psychosocial interventions designed to promote well-being in dementia are often derived from a symptom-focused, loss\/deficit approach, or from broad quality of life concepts. A pan-European dementia working group called for research on the development of an alternative asset\/strengths-based conceptual framework of well-being in dementia. This paper takes forward this recommendation by developing such a framework and using this to map relevant self-report outcome measures.","Three scoping reviews of published studies were conducted iteratively. First, we examined the literature on lived experiences of well-being and quality of life in people with dementia and then the wider dementia literature for application of well-being constructs. The synthesised findings generated conceptual domains of well-being in people with dementia. Corresponding self-report instruments used in dementia research were scoped, categorised within the conceptual framework and their potential value in measuring outcomes for people with dementia was examined.","Six conceptual domains for the measurement of well-being and 35 self-report instruments that have been used with people with dementia were identified. Six instruments were developed specifically for people with dementia, five were derived from the gerontological literature and 24 from the well-being literature. Fifteen instruments and one sub-scale have been examined for psychometric properties\u00a0amongst people with dementia. To date, 20\u00a0have been used as outcome measures, with seven measuring change over time. A number of identified instruments utilise traditional retrospective Likert-scaling response formats, limiting their potential for use with some groups of people with dementia.","An assets\/strengths-based framework is presented, outlining structural domains for selecting self-report measures of well-being in people with dementia. It provides a foundation for enhancing research into processes and outcomes of psychosocial interventions, including instrument development, more precise matching of intervention aims with outcome measurement, and newer technology-based 'in-the-moment' measurement."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clarke","ForeName":"Chris","Initials":"C","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8957-0795","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Faculty

persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are known to be associated with caregiver burdening. Therefore, early recognition of BPSD is necessary to protect these caregivers. The aim of this validation study was to test the internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of an Italian translation of the revised memory and behavior problems checklist (RMBPC), as it demonstrated high plasticity in timely measuring the day-to-day BPSD changes that challenge caregivers. A cohort of 355 dyads composed of AD subjects and their principal caregivers were assessed with the Italian version of RMPBC capitalizing on the information provided by the latter ones. The results were compared with the ones from other predictors (i.e., the Zarit Burben Interview, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the EurQuality of Life, the neuropsychiatric symptoms). The validity and stability of the It-RMBPC resulted being solid and concurrent reliability resulted having higher correlations with principal caregiver anxiety level. Future studies on the role of BPSD in fostering anxiety in AD principal caregivers are merited."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Ottoboni","ForeName":"Giovanni","Initials":"G","Identifier":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7649-6642","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department

of training nursing home staff in the implementation of SDM on agreement of residents' 'life-and-care plans' with the recommendations (primary outcome) and on family caregivers' quality of life and sense of competence, and staff's job satisfaction (secondary outcomes).","In the intervention condition, staff attended a training program on the use of SDM with residents and family caregivers in the care planning process. In the control condition, care planning as usual took place. For the primary outcome, in-depth qualitative and quantitative analyses of the care plans were performed. Multivariate Permutation Tests were applied to assess the impact on secondary outcomes.","Forty-nine residents and family caregivers and 34 professionals were involved. Overall, many of the care plans developed during the intervention showed a high level of agreement with the care planning recommendations. Both Italian and Dutch care plans showed improvement in the number of clear problem statements (p < 0.001). In Italy, significant improvements (p < 0.05) were also found regarding specific care objectives, documentation of objectives met, and of residents and families' involvement.

The AdCare study, a non-profit, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre, pragmatic trial coordinated by the Italian National Institute of Health, aimed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy profiles of three atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine) and one conventional antipsychotic drug (haloperidol) in treating psychosis, aggression and agitation in outpatients with AD. The study was planned to be carried out in 19 clinical centres and to enrol 1000 outpatients. According to Italian law, in the case where a patient is considered unable to give informed consent, a legal representative designated by the court has to provide it. Because of difficulties in the informed consent procedure, the study had to be prematurely interrupted. From February 2009 to April 2010, 83 patients gave informed consent to participate in the trial. Fifty-six patients (68%) were included with consent given by a legal representative, while 27 patients (32%) were considered to provide personal informed consent on the basis of the results from a specifically built procedure. Patients and caregivers were offered the opportunity to participate in the trial before the occurrence of behavioural disturbances, in order to provide them with enough time to consider their participation in the study. Twenty-three patients experienced behavioural, clinically relevant symptoms and were randomized to the study drug; all randomized patients except one had consent for inclusion in the study given by legal representatives. After trial interruption, all patients taking an active drug continued treatment with the same molecule in clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials are acknowledged as the gold standard source of evidence on drug safety and efficacy. The AdCare study showed that an excessively rigid regulation can become a major obstacle while carrying out therapeutic research with incapacitated persons."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Galeotti","ForeName":"Francesca","Initials":"F","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"National

physical and mental health. The Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) is the most widely used instrument for assessing family carer burden and the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the ZBI (I-ZBI).","I-ZBI was administered to a non-randomized sample of 273 caregivers related to consecutively attending outpatients with a previously established primary diagnosis of dementia, according to DSM-IV criteria. Measurements used for the construct validity of the instrument were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). Validity and reliability were evaluated, as well as the factor structure of the instrument.","Most caregivers were children (65%), female (72%) and living with the patient (53%), with quite a high level of burden. The I-ZBI demonstrates good reliability with high internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.90) and split-half correlation of 0.78, and good concurrent validity with other assessment tools. A five-factor solution was obtained for the I-ZBI and the original bi-factorial structure of the ZBI was not confirmed.","The Italian version of the Zarit Burden Interview is valid, reliable and useful for use in clinical contexts and in future studies that could lead to a better understanding of carer burden in dementia. Clarifying the factorial structure of the ZBI would help to further the understanding of the large body of research using it and would also help to advance the understanding of subjective burden."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Chattat","ForeName":"Rabih","Initials":"R","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Department of Psychology, University of Bologna, Italy."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Cortesi","ForeName":"Valeria","Initials":"V"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Izzicupo","ForeName":"Fabio","Initials":"F"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Del Re","ForeName":"Maria Letizia","Initials":"ML"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Sgarbi","ForeName":"Cinzia","Initials":"C"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Fabbo","ForeName":"Andrea","Initials":"A"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Bergonzini","ForeName":"Elisa","Initials":"E"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Validation Study"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"16"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Int Psychogeriatr","NlmUniqueID":"9007918","ISSNLinking":"1041-6102"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cost of Illness"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["diagnosis","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Family Health"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interview, Psychological","QualifierName":["methods","standards"]},{"DescriptorName":"Italy"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"},{"DescriptorName":"Psychological Tests"},{"DescriptorName":"Reproducibility of Results"},{"DescriptorName":"Stress, Psychological","QualifierName":["diagnosis","etiology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"},{"DescriptorName":"Translating"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"1","Day":"6","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2014","Month":"4","Day":"26","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["21205379","S1041610210002218","10.1017\/S1041610210002218"]}}}]}
