Physicians have to make treatment decisions for patients with dementia together with proxies and\/or nurses.

Ten of these attributes were used for the proxies.

The non-pharmacological treatment option was chosen by 52% of the proxies and 71% of the physicians and nurses. The respondents who chose antipsychotics rated the aspects \"fastest result\" and \"most effective\" as important. Physicians ranked \"experience with antipsychotics\" as an important aspect for prescribing antipsychotics. Only the proxies rated the aspect \"having a low negative effect on the patient\" as important. The nurses and elderly care physicians who chose the non-pharmaceutical treatment ranked \"appropriateness\" and \"of little burden to the patient\" as important aspects.","While doctors and nurses prefer non-pharmacological interventions, proxies indicated a preference for pharmacological treatment because of the immediate effect.
