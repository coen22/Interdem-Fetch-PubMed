Admiral Nurses, registered nurses specialising in dementia, provide holistic and person-centred support to families living with dementia. This study assessed the effectiveness of the Admiral Nurses' approach from the perspective of family carers who had accessed their service.","A questionnaire was developed with input from family carers and Admiral Nurses and questions were based around the Admiral Nursing Standards. 685 questionnaires were sent out in total to carers in receipt of care from three different regions in England.","207 questionnaires (30.2% response rate) were analysed. Admiral Nurses' knowledge and skills and their interventions were found helpful by 81.5% and 82.6% of respondents, respectively (mean values). Respondents also rated them effective in developing rapport (96.5%, mean value) and recognising and supporting the needs of the dyad (85.8%, mean value). More varied views were expressed in relation to activities and stimulation for the person with dementia, and to advice around medications and their effects, with around a third (n = 57, 31% and n = 63, 33.9%, respectively) of respondents finding Admiral Nurses not helpful, whilst 24.6% (n = 46) thought so in relation to care coordination. A higher number of contacts with Admiral Nurses (5+) and carer gender (female) were significant predictors of carers' satisfaction.","Whilst some aspects of supporting carers are performed less well from the carers' perspective, overall family carers in receipt of Admiral Nursing support perceived their family-centred approach as helpful\/effective."]},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Maio","ForeName":"Laura","Initials":"L","AffiliationInfo":[{"Affiliation":"a Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health , University College London , London , UK."},{"Affiliation":"b Dementia UK , London , UK."}]},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Botsford","ForeName":"Julia","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"b Dementia UK , London , UK."}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Iliffe","ForeName":"Steve","Initials":"S","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"a Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health , University College London , London , UK."}}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":"Journal Article"},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2015","Month":"06","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"Aging Ment Health","NlmUniqueID":"9705773","ISSNLinking":"1360-7863"},"CitationSubset":"IM","MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Caregivers","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":"nursing"},{"DescriptorName":"England"},{"DescriptorName":"Family","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"Interpersonal Relations"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Surveys and Questionnaires"}]},"KeywordList":{"@attributes":{"Owner":"NOTNLM"},"Keyword":["Admiral Nurse","carers","dementia","family carers"]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2015","Month":"6","Day":"12","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2015","Month":"6","Day":"13","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2017","Month":"10","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["26062969","10.1080\/13607863.2015.1052776"]}}},{"MedlineCitation":{"@attributes":{"Status":"MEDLINE","Owner":"NLM"},"PMID":"22150385","DateCompleted":{"Year":"2013","Month":"05","Day":"09"},"DateRevised":{"Year":"2012","Month":"09","Day":"07"},"Article":{"@attributes":{"PubModel":"Print-Electronic"},"Journal":{"ISSN":"1365-2648","JournalIssue":{"@attributes":{"CitedMedium":"Internet"},"Volume":"68","Issue":"10","PubDate":{"Year":"2012","Month":"Oct"}},"Title":"Journal of advanced nursing","ISOAbbreviation":"J Adv Nurs"},"ArticleTitle":"Dementia and relationships: experiences of partners in minority ethnic communities.","Pagination":{"MedlinePgn":"2207-17"},"ELocationID":"10.1111\/j.1365-2648.2011.05905.x","Abstract":{"AbstractText":["This article is a report of a study aimed at examining the experiences of partners of people with dementia in two minority ethnic communities.","Cultural background is important in how people perceive the effects of dementia and respond to them. To date there has been little research on the experiences of minority ethnic partners in the U.K.","Using a constructivist grounded theory approach data collection took place in London, England, over an 18-month period between 2007 and 2009. A total of 43 in-depth interviews were conducted with seven Greek Cypriot and six African Caribbean partners of people with dementia.","The outcomes of the study revealed partners of people with dementia engaged in an ongoing process of 'redefining relationships'. Greek Cypriot partners tended to emphasize family relationships whilst African Caribbean partners tended to view themselves primarily as an individual or as part of a couple.","Increased understanding of how dementia is experienced by partners of people from specific ethnic groups with dementia can equip nurses to give culturally appropriate advice and support. The study findings suggest that ethnicity alone cannot account for individual responses to dementia in a partner, and therefore awareness of cultural factors needs to be balanced with sensitivity to the unique life experience and relationships of the individuals."],"CopyrightInformation":"\u00a9 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."},"AuthorList":{"@attributes":{"CompleteYN":"Y"},"Author":[{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Botsford","ForeName":"Julia","Initials":"J","AffiliationInfo":{"Affiliation":"Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, London, UK. julia.botsford@beh-mht.nhs.uk"}},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Clarke","ForeName":"Charlotte L","Initials":"CL"},{"@attributes":{"ValidYN":"Y"},"LastName":"Gibb","ForeName":"Catherine E","Initials":"CE"}]},"Language":"eng","PublicationTypeList":{"PublicationType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]},"ArticleDate":{"@attributes":{"DateType":"Electronic"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"11"}},"MedlineJournalInfo":{"Country":"England","MedlineTA":"J Adv Nurs","NlmUniqueID":"7609811","ISSNLinking":"0309-2402"},"CitationSubset":["IM","N"],"MeshHeadingList":{"MeshHeading":[{"DescriptorName":"Adaptation, Psychological"},{"DescriptorName":"African Continental Ancestry Group","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Aged, 80 and over"},{"DescriptorName":"Attitude to Health","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Cultural Competency"},{"DescriptorName":"Dementia","QualifierName":["ethnology","nursing"]},{"DescriptorName":"European Continental Ancestry Group","QualifierName":"psychology"},{"DescriptorName":"Family Relations","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Female"},{"DescriptorName":"Greece","QualifierName":"ethnology"},{"DescriptorName":"Humans"},{"DescriptorName":"London"},{"DescriptorName":"Longitudinal Studies"},{"DescriptorName":"Male"},{"DescriptorName":"Middle Aged"},{"DescriptorName":"Narration"},{"DescriptorName":"Spouses","QualifierName":["ethnology","psychology"]},{"DescriptorName":"West Indies","QualifierName":"ethnology"}]}},"PubmedData":{"History":{"PubMedPubDate":[{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"entrez"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"pubmed"},"Year":"2011","Month":"12","Day":"14","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"},{"@attributes":{"PubStatus":"medline"},"Year":"2013","Month":"5","Day":"10","Hour":"6","Minute":"0"}]},"PublicationStatus":"ppublish","ArticleIdList":{"ArticleId":["22150385","10.1111\/j.1365-2648.2011.05905.x"]}}}]}
